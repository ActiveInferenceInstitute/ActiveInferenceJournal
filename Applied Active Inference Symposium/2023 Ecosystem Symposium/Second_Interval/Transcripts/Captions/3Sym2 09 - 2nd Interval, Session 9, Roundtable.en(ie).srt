5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,699
all right

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,980
the next session is going to be the

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,800
final session of

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,140
this symposium

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,699
it's been a really

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,500
Incredible Journey

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,019
and I think this final session is going

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,399
to be great as well

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,899
so

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,739
we have a whole panel here

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,260
and

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,239
people can use their cameras even though

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,820
I'm not if they want to

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,960
um

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,239
welcome everyone

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,840
all just introduce the facilitator Kurt

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,620
Jai mungle so Kurt is a a legend in the

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,160
active ecosystem and has done incredible

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,460
work with a variety of researchers and

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,220
curious individuals in the space so we

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,320
could think of no one better

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,960
to host this conversation

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,700
and

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,840
bring it all together so Kurt I'll pass

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
it to you

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,439
you'll keep an eye on the live chat

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,979
anyone can call it if they need any

32
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,860
supports otherwise thanks everybody for

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,220
joining and uh

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,100
we don't see you yet Kurt but yeah I it

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,420
would it be all right if I left and then

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,799
came right back for whatever reason my

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,299
camera is not working sounds good sounds

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,820
good okay I'll be right back in about 25

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,298
seconds

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
well welcome everyone

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,658
um

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,060
we will get started in just a second

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,530
[Music]

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,139
so odd I apologize for that okay well

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,420
you can hear my voice at least

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,520
yep

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,860
just give me a moment let me apologize

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,280
boy okay

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,220
well

50
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,280
well we'll do what we can okay

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,060
so you all can't see me but

52
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,220
that's all right so we have this

53
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,400
All-Star panel here today which to me

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,660
means my invitation must have been a

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,400
mistake but I'll take it thank you to

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,440

89
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,840
initiatives my name is and I use them I

90
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,100
use my background in mathematical

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,320
physics to analyze various theories of

92
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,418
everything that are proposed these

93
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,580
include both a theoretical physics side

94
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,560
of grand unification with gravity and

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,780
dualities other schemes as well as

96
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,220
attempting to understand what

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,259
constitutes Consciousness you can find

98
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,820
the podcast by typing in theories of

99
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,199
everything onto YouTube or whatever

100
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,720
podcast catcher you have

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,180
so my question to everyone the initial

102
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,639
question is what have you been working

103
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,560
on in the past few months and what

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,880
excites you about it

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,880
we'll start with

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,780
Bert you seem to be smiling

107
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,159
and your name sounds like mine

108
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,820
okay so

109
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,139
um all right so my name is and uh yeah I

110
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,320
lead a lab in in an electrical

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,820
engineering department

112
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,639
and so our lab is called by slot as you

113
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,979
as you mentioned so we are interested in

114
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,380
Bayesian influence in in general but

115
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,960
more specifically in doing it as fast as

116
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,000
possible that that has lots of

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,340
applications outside active inference

118
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,460
also in yeah for Signal processing and

119
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,979
other control systems but definitely of

120
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,560
course also for active inference so have

121
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,900
our work over the past few months but

122
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,300
even over the past few years has been on

123
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,919
developing a toolbox

124
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,800
to support or to get as far as we can go

125
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,319
with trying to do real-time Beijing

126
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,940
inference or real time for energy

127
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,060
minimization and and trying it in

128
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,039
applications

129
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,520
um so that's that's the work that I I

130
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,060
try to lead a team of PhD students who

131
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,460
would do the real work of course I walk

132
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,620
around with a cup of coffee but uh

133
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,699
that's what they've been working on

134
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:48,139
great and Professor Lemke please

135
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,259
yeah well what I've been working on in

136
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,580
the last

137
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,880
um I don't know a year or so is spending

138
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,039
a lot of time thinking about

139
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,919
how it is that a faith framework in

140
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,759
particular surrendered to a higher power

141
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,500
improves people's lives

142
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,380
and I've been really struggling to come

143
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,080
up with a way of talking about this that

144
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,240
is inclusive thinking about it talking

145
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,620
about it it gets to a kind of core piece

146
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,900
of it that I'm interested in which is

147
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,360
not so much whether or not God exists

148
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,699
and what the proof is or not of whether

149
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,940
God exists but really what what is it

150
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,819
that changes in people's lives when they

151
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,979
undergo a spiritual transformation when

152
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,020
they surrender to a higher power

153
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,740
why why do their lives get better when

154
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,240
they do get better

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,300
and um I'm really new to the active

156
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,180
inference World Daniel Friedman is the

157
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,639
one who's introduced me to these ideas

158
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,160
I'm really excited about the ways in

159
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,819
which the whole active inference model

160
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,580
might help me at least think about

161
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,940
what's going on there and um so so

162
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,020
that's what I'm that's what I'm working

163
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,240
on it's a little weird but uh that's

164
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
what I'm interested in

165
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,620
great professor friston

166
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,620
you're muted

167
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,660
yes that's going to be the title of my

168
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,979
next book Carl you're on mute

169
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,020
a retro from here

170
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,940
possibly the future

171
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,759
um I I generally work on what I'm told

172
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,740
to work on so I'm just been trying to

173
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,779
list what I've been working on

174
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,200
um in the past few months interestingly

175
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,599
um it actually starts with um Daniel

176
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,500
Friedman and his um fascination with um

177
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,740
along with Axel constant for

178
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,839
evolutionary explanations and specimen

179
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,279
in the scale of three issues that we've

180
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,899
been hearing about

181
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,080
um in the prior session and so that's

182
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,360
what I was working on really a

183
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,260
scale-free approach to understanding

184
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,720
temporary nested processes as free

185
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,940
energy minimizing processes as a kind of

186
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,940
active inference and how that would lead

187
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,360
to a variational synthesis of evolution

188
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,040
and then I was told to work on belief

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,760
sharing by Mao and colleagues versus

190
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,980
um and um

191
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,560
worked on that in the context of

192
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,200
synthetic language and try to

193
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,940
um

194
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,200
establish a really simple proof of

195
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,440
principle that communication was an

196
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,200
emerging property of any free Ensemble

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,500
free energy minimizing system

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,620
[Music]

199
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,440
um and the just to Open brackets is to

200
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,120
make the observation it struck me time

201
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,339
and time again uh during the session

202
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,060
today how important communication is

203
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,080
um you know whether we're talking about

204
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,220
birds passing messages or responding to

205
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,380
uh you know you've got a new posterior

206
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,760
or we're talking about the kind of

207
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,380
communication

208
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,360
um that Mal was talking about Well

209
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,279
everybody's been talking about it

210
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,440
doesn't seem to be a really uh and

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,420
indeed the guy the guy

212
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,480
um notion of over connectivity and too

213
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
much communication or the wrong kind of

214
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,560
communication

215
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,540
um it does strike me that's quite

216
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,480
Central uh to a lot to the both the

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,839
theme of the um the workshop

218
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,519
um and

219
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,620
um the specific presentations that we've

220
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,700
heard

221
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,980
um and then uh in the past few weeks

222
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,040
working on stuff I think that Bert would

223
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,760
be

224
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,640
um more interested in which is

225
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,860
um fast and Frugal

226
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,140
um message passing schemes that

227
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,080
um enable the evaluation the expected

228
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,620
free energy not to suffer from uh the

229
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,180
limitations imposed by Deep tree

230
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,860
searches so

231
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,200
um possibly uh Ashwin has spoke about

232
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
this earlier on but um you're using

233
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,579
ideas from dynamic programming backwards

234
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,399
induction to try and

235
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,440
um take the pressure off the message

236
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
passing to get fast and efficient uh

237
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
evaluations of the expected free energy

238
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,920
in sort of um sort of single unit uh

239
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,320
sort of single agent active inference

240
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,680
what have I been doing this week

241
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,560
can't remember no that's what I've been

242
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
doing

243
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,279
great Raphael Kaufman please

244
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,820
just a moment

245
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,579
and can everyone else hear

246
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,120
okay

247
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,519
what about now yeah great yeah thanks uh

248
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,740
and it's contagious I think uh I know so

249
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,180
I've also been drinking a lot of coffee

250
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,360
as I've been caring for my now nine

251
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,620
month old daughter

252
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,120
so uh congratulations thank you so aside

253
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,620
from sleep deprivation what I've been

254
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,120
doing is

255
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,680
um uh I told you guys about this in the

256
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,620
in the session earlier today but uh in a

257
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,480
nutshell been working on what we call

258
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,720
the the the guy protocol uh or the guy

259
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
Network which is this uh this

260
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,800
um open approach for for building a uh

261
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,019
common uh common engine you can think of

262
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,440
it as a common runtime and uh in a

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,079
common uh language for with the building

264
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,740
blocks of of shared decision making

265
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,519
um and um in the context of on the Mad

266
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,760
crisis and getting to getting to a set

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,040
of of

268
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,779
building blocks for decision making that

269
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,700
don't kill us all so that's that's kind

270
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,839
of it

271
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
and then Raphael how many how much

272
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,360
coffee is a lot of coffee

273
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,920
well it's espresso so I don't think it's

274
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,880
quite comparable to like American coffee

275
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,260
all right

276
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,320
and Guillaume Dumas please

277
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,959
yes sure can you hear me

278
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,279
yes

279
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,620
okay uh so in the context of action

280
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,339
inference uh I have mostly focused on uh

281
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,339
well the two big topic of my lab so uh

282
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,720
Precision Psychiatry and social

283
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,639
physiology so on the Precision

284
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,540
Psychiatry side

285
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,660
presented earlier in this Symposium uh

286
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,300
work on trying to model theory of mind

287
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,180
to it being able to evaluate uh through

288
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,800
digital phenotyping the level of

289
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,540
sophistication of interaction in

290
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,339
patients with neurodevelopmental

291
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,420
disorders

292
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,720
and that connect with also our interest

293
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,480
in the social mind and how we can

294
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
connect our understanding of

295
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,700
how we deal with other people but with

296
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,660
also ourselves and so that connect with

297
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,600
other work at the Mila with the Deep

298
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,360
learning architecture with ir order

299
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,760
functioning humans where we're trying to

300
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,079
combine different theories of

301
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,120
Consciousness such as Global artwork

302
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,459
space and attention schema Theory and in

303
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,079
the context of attention schema Theory

304
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,139
there is this kind of recycling of self

305
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,639
and other mechanisms so that's one

306
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,300
big work and on the other side I'm very

307
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,839
interested also in a military agent

308
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,660
systems and so with the Natalie Castle

309
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,260
we're going to join us uh soon we've

310
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,060
been working on creativity and the

311
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,040
emergence of cultural norms in

312
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
meditation systems with the idea of

313
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,220
applying that to climate action and also

314
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,560
a new project that is starting here with

315
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,699
the an frf of a big Canadian project on

316
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,160
indigenous knowledge and how we can

317
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,680
think about new narrative around AI

318
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,320
typically a less solipsistic and

319
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,260
realistic way of dealing with AI

320
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,699
so that's the two main field of research

321
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,440
can you explain what you mean by less

322
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,320
solipsistic less solips oh geez Louise

323
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,519
the the Californian view of AI because

324
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,260
uh the narrative is mainly driven by uh

325
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,779
us and California right now tends to

326
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,380
circle around optimization profits I

327
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,399
mean even open AI states that uh AGI is

328
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,420
about optimizing profitable human tasks

329
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
they they put like a profitable in their

330
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,920
definitions uh in the case of indigenous

331
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,120
systems of knowledge we are more talking

332
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,880
about Community

333
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,560
sustainability

334
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,260
and the view already only in the

335
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,959
application is less individualistic but

336
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,079
also in the cognitive science point of

337
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,139
view we we have like the the outcore

338
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,540
computationalism that would say the

339
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,639
brain is just like a computer in a very

340
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
restrictive sense and so AI like

341
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,600
typically the those Transformers that

342
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
are massively used right now are kind of

343
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,760
like bringing that in a very silicon

344
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,279
sense while we are an embodied systems

345
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,560
that are

346
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,180
constituted by our interaction with

347
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,160
others and so like in a way how we can

348
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,440
think about artificial intelligence in

349
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,260
this kind of more co-constitutive way

350
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,139
and through a Developmental and cultural

351
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,459
lens

352
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,779
mm-hmm

353
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,579
okay now speaking of the brand as a

354
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,740
computer we frequently frequently hear

355
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,540
in these circles the brain as a

356
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,220
predictive machine

357
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,560
so where does this the quote-unquote

358
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,240
brain as a predictive machine have its

359
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,940
limits and also is that

360
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,339
to be interpreted as implying conscious

361
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,680
experience is a predictive machine as

362
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,040
well okay and if not why not so

363
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,259
I think Carl you'd be a great person to

364
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,880
start this off and then we'll go around

365
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,160
the table again

366
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,559
yeah I'm just mindful of Mao's

367
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,900
presentation the past half hour

368
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,780
um and a notion of temporal thickness

369
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,480
um and I'm sure that's got a lot to do

370
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,900
with the necessary conditions for the

371
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,520
kind of Consciousness and guessing

372
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,500
you're referring to you know that

373
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,599
freedom from the moment

374
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,419
um and if one reads prediction in its

375
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,700
sort of psychological or pretensive or

376
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,960
pretension

377
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,179
um

378
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,580
nature in terms of being able to predict

379
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,919
what will happen in the future I think

380
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,020
that the um

381
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,120
that's that that's going to be a sort of

382
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,840
uh a key bright line between things that

383
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,000
um do not possess

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,360
certain kind of um bentians and things

385
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,679
that do

386
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,780
um and that bright line just rests

387
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,640
basically upon

388
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,500
um well from perspective of active

389
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
infants having a generative model that

390
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,960
includes the consequences of your own

391
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,900
actions in the future so just by having

392
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,260
consequences you're now talking about

393
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,780
um the future and the cause the

394
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,460
consequences

395
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,500
um in the future now become random

396
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,600
variables therefore you have to infer

397
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,760
them which leads you directly to the

398
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,799
notion of planning as inference which

399
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
means that bright lie is just the

400
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
difference between things that plan and

401
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,900
do not plan

402
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,460
um and

403
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,020
um I would guess that that's where you

404
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,320
probably want to start in terms of

405
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,720
foregrounding the role of prediction

406
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,080
um as being

407
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,039
an aspect of self-organization and its

408
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,799
sort of reading under active inference

409
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,260
that characterizes just things from

410
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,539
non-conscious things namely the ability

411
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,220
to plan does that make sense

412
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,679
I have follow-up questions we'll get to

413
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,559
them at some point but for now Anna Do

414
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,179
you have do you have any comments on

415
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,340
that and and Bert as well afterward

416
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,260
um well you know I'm I'm new to this

417
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,299
field so I'm just familiarizing myself

418
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,360
even with the language but I I can

419
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
respond to of the question the brain is

420
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
a predictive machine in terms of

421
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,380
the work that I do clinically in the

422
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,140
kind of Psychopathology that I see when

423
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,200
I'm working with patients

424
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,880
um you know we I work primarily with

425
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,679
narrative the stories that they tell

426
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,780
about their lives and one of the

427
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,000
recurring themes I've seen through my

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,059
work is that when patients tell stories

429
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,280
in which they are perpetually the

430
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,740
victims of other people's actions of the

431
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,340
world they tend to then that tends to be

432
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,919
a predictive model for them so that they

433
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,460
will then go out into the world and

434
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,200
unconsciously create scenarios which

435
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
will perpetuate their victimhood and

436
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,260
that part of getting into Wellness is to

437
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,840
stop seeing themselves as entirely the

438
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,299
victim of other people or circumstance

439
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,720
instead begin to appreciate what they

440
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,539
contribute to their life problems so I

441
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,160
guess when I think of the limits of the

442
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,679
brain as a predictive machine I think in

443
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,679
some ways one of the big limits is that

444
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,840
it's a very powerful predictive machine

445
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,440
that actually allows us to subsequently

446
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,559
shape what actually happens to us and or

447
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,539
our perceptions of what happens to us

448
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,020
which then can perpetuate

449
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,539
a false narrative and I I'll just give

450
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,419
one small example from my own life I've

451
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,520
had um you know my conflicts with my

452
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,440
mother and one of my beefs about her is

453
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,960
that she's a very poor communicator and

454
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,240
that whenever I email her I either get a

455
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,280
cryptic response or no response at all

456
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
and it drives me crazy and about five

457
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,740
years ago she sent an email asked me

458
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,539
some questions I wrote her back and

459
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,660
responded and it was clear to me

460
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,580
um that that required yet a response

461
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,700
from her which I never got and that then

462
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,460
perpetuated my narrative about her as a

463
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,440
very poor communicator and many other

464
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
negative things and then about three

465
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,940
months after I sent that email I found

466
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,520
the email in my draft inbox in my draft

467
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,340
box so I had never actually responded to

468
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,559
there's email I hadn't actually sent the

469
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
email and that was for me um just a you

470
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,260
know a personal uh wonderful example of

471
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,520
the ways in which we can our actions can

472
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,140
actually

473
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,940
um

474
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,039
be manipulated to support our models and

475
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,559
perpetuate falsehoods about the world

476
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,720
that we live in

477
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,659
right and I I have a quick question Bert

478
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,820
just for Anna before we get to you so

479
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,799
use the word narrative there how are you

480
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,659
defining the word narrative is it the

481
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,700
same as model is it a sequence of events

482
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,740
like what is the specific definition of

483
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,700
narrative

484
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,260
you know I never really thought about it

485
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,539
in those terms but when I talk about

486
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,120
narrative I'm talking about

487
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,780
um

488
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,120
the stories that people tell about their

489
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
lives because that's sort of my data

490
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,940
um and and also about models because

491
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,200
what I've discovered about

492
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,020
self-narrative is it's not just a way to

493
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,480
organize the past it also becomes a road

494
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,520
map for the future that's the language

495
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
that I use but I see it Maps very nicely

496
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,820
onto urals a language of modeling the

497
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,440
world

498
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,740
I see Professor DeVries please

499
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,440
um yeah it's it's clear that uh

500
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,380
the ability to predict is is the essence

501
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,440
of intelligent decision making

502
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,240
um yeah I have a different background

503
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,220
right I'm not a psychiatrist so I think

504
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,780
about these things in different really

505
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,940
the thing that that I think about when I

506
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,919
think about prediction is I I would

507
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,340
assume that it brain predicts far ahead

508
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,580
but things get less accurate right if I

509
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,980
predict that I want to go three quarters

510
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,900
around around about I don't care about

511
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,840
the centimeter where my car goes when

512
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,940
I'm around here I just want to get in in

513
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,860
the right lane

514
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,299
um and I would assume that the brain

515
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,400
doesn't take much it takes less

516
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,980
computations if you care about things

517
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,580
less precisely but that's very hard in a

518
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,600
computer we have this is what uh kind of

519
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,240
kills Us in uh in in I think in our

520
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,600
current uh way of implementing active

521
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,179
inference when we want to predict a deep

522
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,360
hat we don't care about the accuracy but

523
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,700
we don't know how to do it much cheaper

524
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,120
when things are less accurate and so

525
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,760
that's still a that's a problem that we

526
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,400
need to be working on

527
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,799
um it might be in

528
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,100
it might be a key to building or to

529
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,320
scaling up active Entrance Agency if we

530
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,020
can actually

531
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,640
compute messages that we want to know

532
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,760
that we don't care about if they are

533
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,799
less precise that we also spend much

534
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,000
less computation on there

535
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,320
thank you now Professor Kaufman

536
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,600
uh I am not a professor but I'll answer

537
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,700
anyway

538
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,880
um can you just call me Rafa uh yeah so

539
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,280
uh there's uh so many really interesting

540
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,380
Avenues here and it's not often that I

541
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,720
get the the the pleasure of discussing

542
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
this kind of stuff

543
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,539
with this uh kind of diverse crowd but I

544
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,200
do I mean I've been interested in uh in

545
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
these questions uh for for a pretty long

546
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,260
time and I I think what comes to mind is

547
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,480
like how

548
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,200
how active inference has a lens uh for

549
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,720
instance it enables us to to to to

550
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,299
get another sense of what non-dualist

551
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,820
views on Consciousness uh are saying

552
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,000
when they when they uh get us

553
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,860
experientially to to notice the

554
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,880
difference between what we actually

555
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,679
perceive and what

556
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,360
between the different various different

557
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,059
uh uh processes or things that are going

558
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,400
on in our in our head in our tendency to

559
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,679
like want them all together into the

560
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,740
same okay this is this is my this is my

561
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,500
experience that that I'm immersed in

562
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,299
um so noticing being able to to to uh

563
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,860
notice the difference between the the

564
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,340
the the the the process of proceeding

565
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,100
and act and and acting and it's

566
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,260
automated and the narrative where the

567
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,900
various narratives that are going on uh

568
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,240
uh in parallel to my head whether I'm

569
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,960
aware of them or not and uh and our

570
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,840
ability to to to just put kind of

571
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,580
seemingly arbitrary Mana levels on top

572
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,220
of it to to try to make sense of it all

573
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,120
into to force uh for static experience

574
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,440
of having multiple Americans and

575
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,120
multiple framings going on at the same

576
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,159
time makes uh make sense of that

577
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,400
experience in a in a

578
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
um in a way that aligns with the

579
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,659
presuppositions about about how things

580
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,700
are so

581
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,380
um I I think that's super interesting

582
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,679
and also I also I like that uh like this

583
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,220
this view of Consciousness as being kind

584
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,799
of uh defined by having a narrative or

585
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,020
an internal model that's about self or

586
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,299
that at least uh it's about self and

587
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,100
that leads us as Carl said to the

588
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,140
blindness influence uh that's actually

589
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,299
like super deflationary in a way that

590
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,580
that people are not uh not used to

591
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,940
thinking about it and uh and so it's an

592
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,059
exciting it's opening the doors all sort

593
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,500
of exciting interdisciplinary

594
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,140
conversations we had on the basis of at

595
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,140
least I feel like better uh less talking

596
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,360
past each other than we've ever had so

597
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,400
I'm excited about that

598
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,440
Aaron how is it that you're using the

599
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,779
word deflationary there Carl I remember

600
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,340
I asked you about that when we had our

601
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,919
podcast together but Raphael a similar

602
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,900
question so you said deflationary view

603
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
when we have narratives of self do you

604
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,340
mean it leads us to something that

605
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,500
Consciousness is much more than

606
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,860
sorry much yeah yeah I mean it's uh not

607
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,200
necessarily much less than in the in the

608
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,380
uh subjective sense but it's uh perhaps

609
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,620
much much less than in the in the

610
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,440
scientific sense so uh one example of

611
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,200
like one not saying exactly that but but

612
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,720
maybe something close to what uh Daniel

613
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,020
Bennett calls heterophenology which is

614
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,059
basically the the statement that the the

615
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,860
sum of what one can say scientifically

616
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,360
about Consciousness is is

617
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,659
um is equal to what can be can be uh

618
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,820
what can be studied and uh and modeled

619
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
and theorized and communicated and

620
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,380
learned and uh agreed upon on the basis

621
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,120
of objective data about what people

622
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,860
including you but they're also other

623
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,260
people say uh about their experience

624
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,539
which and of course like what can be

625
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,919
measured up neural correlates and

626
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,400
whatever which is not the same as or not

627
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
necessarily the same as our experience

628
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,820
so our direct what we think is our

629
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,500
direct experience of being conscious

630
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,960
conscious right so one way to look at it

631
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,419
is that uh uh is that the science of

632
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,159
Consciousness doesn't necessarily have

633
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,380
to put the privacy on on people the

634
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,659
purpose people think they have quality

635
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,299
uh that that we thought and that sense

636
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,600
this deflationary right it's

637
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,880
um yeah you have to explain why people

638
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,679
believe they have quality or not white

639
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,419
people have quality because it's not

640
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,520
it's not necessarily a scientific truth

641
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,539
that people have value right

642
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,340
Professor Dumas

643
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,039
uh yeah so well on the limits of brain

644
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,260
experiment well which we should be

645
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,559
always careful to not move from uh one

646
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,340
uh

647
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,220
map territory fallacy to another one for

648
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,659
sure so we need to be uh Skeptics and

649
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,260
avoid to refi the methods and well the

650
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,320
this world Symposium I'm sure this

651
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,480
metaphor is super useful and and

652
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,860
fruitful but I can see like two main uh

653
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,600
limits or at least things where we

654
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,080
should be careful so uh following what

655
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,140
uh Professor Lemke said like in

656
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,779
Psychiatry I think the the looping

657
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,720
effects and the way people picture

658
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,559
themselves uh can be uh very

659
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,720
unpredictable and so the way uh we think

660
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,520
about the brain as a predictive machine

661
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,320
think prediction for patients would have

662
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,020
different signification of what we mean

663
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,899
by predictive machines in the context of

664
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,539
factory inference and in general also

665
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,399
like uh the I I can see that certain uh

666
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,799
psychologists or anthropologists would

667
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,220
have a big appeal or a sudden for uh

668
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,840
active inference and prenergic

669
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,020
principles but taking the the words uh

670
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,539
as uh directly what they think the word

671
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,360
mean where it needs to be we need to be

672
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,059
careful the way to communicate it and

673
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,179
typically Following also what Professor

674
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,480
debris said about uh predict prediction

675
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,340
as being super important for decision

676
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,000
making I think like uh

677
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,039
we should be careful about the the

678
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,039
weirdness of uh cognitive science and

679
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,600
how it doesn't necessarily expand to uh

680
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,640
non-western educated industrialized

681
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,159
country where maybe the cultural value

682
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,440
is not about optimization of your

683
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,220
decision making or your profit and so

684
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,200
that's the first thing where I think we

685
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,000
should be careful it's more like a

686
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,340
matter of how to communicate the theory

687
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,860
in that case not necessarily a limit of

688
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,799
the theory itself but the the second one

689
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,020
is

690
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,100
that the the equivalence or not

691
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,820
with other Frameworks so like uh

692
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,039
I can see uh we are the Mao uh al-basa

693
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,880
talking about category Theory and I'm

694
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,179
very curious about right now among the

695
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,340
different Frameworks that are out there

696
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,059
how can we Define what is equivalent or

697
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,940
not with actually inference to be able

698
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,539
to to see those limits uh maybe we are

699
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,220
leaving what happened with quantum

700
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,720
mechanics in the in the early uh 20th

701
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,100
century with different interpretation

702
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,260
with different tools to model quantum

703
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,240
mechanics and air with artificial

704
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,740
intelligence and cognitive Neuroscience

705
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,740
we have also all those Frameworks and I

706
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,500
think the limitation would be then to

707
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,600
not take this interpretation as the only

708
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,020
one but uh try to have a crosstalk and a

709
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,559
differential diagnosis of which one is

710
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,240
the best for explaining what

711
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,000
okay now my role is the moderator but I

712
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,919
would like you all to to speak to one

713
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,299
another so I'm going to ask a question

714
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,760
that will serve us well you each will

715
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,740
speak on it but as the other person is

716
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,360
speaking as sorry as the other people

717
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,640
are speaking just think okay is there a

718
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,020
question that I have or is there a

719
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,720
comment that I have so the question is

720
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,179
what are some of the recent advancements

721
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,620
or breakthroughs in your respective

722
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,179
fields that you find particularly

723
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,880
promising

724
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,760
and well recent let's say

725
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,399
2020 until now

726
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,440
so we'll start off with Raphael you're

727
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,260
smiling and you look back to Champion oh

728
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,419
I was thinking what is my field right

729
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,940
because

730
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,940
uh we're very much in the in the

731
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,100
um in the last mile of applying the the

732
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,659
wonderful stuff that y'all come up with

733
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,860
and uh and uh making it uh useful on the

734
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,020
ground but

735
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,659
so I'm I'm extraordinarily excited about

736
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:09,620
research like what uh what Bert is doing

737
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,779
and uh uh I feel like as uh as you

738
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,279
almost saying we're also starting to see

739
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,480
some some conversions on uh on different

740
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,700
um different ways to get to to the same

741
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,700
uh at least the same shape of answers

742
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,100
and in some cases even to the same

743
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,700
um

744
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,140
the same uh results so one example of

745
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,340
this is uh work that uh

746
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,279
um Chris Chris Fields call and others

747
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,039
have been doing on uh on the the quantum

748
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,760
uh

749
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,779
basically explaining Quantum information

750
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,779
Theory uh and uh and how it relates to

751
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,480
to the free energy principle looking at

752
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,980
the free energy Principle as the as the

753
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,500
classical limit of of quantum

754
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,840
information Theory and I don't pretend

755
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,600
to to understand all of it but as

756
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,219
somebody who has school is coming from a

757
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,980
quantum physics background uh just uh uh

758
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,780
being alive to see this this kind of

759
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,239
conversions happening which as I mean as

760
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,300
as uh as kyom said you know we've been

761
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,040
at this at this business of like both

762
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,719
classical what's what the hell is going

763
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,699
on for over a century now and it's nice

764
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,399
to to be at a time where again we're

765
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,980
we're starting to talk less about each

766
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,599
other

767
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,040
and that's that's from up here

768
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,780
perspective from a practical perspective

769
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,879
I think just uh just finding that we

770
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,879
have all the building blocks to to

771
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,639
uh create

772
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,280
uh fast interpretable

773
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,418
um

774
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,839
um reliable and aligned

775
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,000
um decision making systems which

776
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
includes uh AI systems autonomous

777
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,020
systems that have all those

778
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,080
characteristics and that it turns out

779
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,220
that all the things that the

780
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,200
reinforcement learning and uh and the

781
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,940
neural networks people thought were very

782
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,520
hard or impossible are sort of in the

783
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,820
realm of what we can do uh looking at

784
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,680
things from an active inference lens and

785
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,200
vice versa a lot of things that that

786
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,079
that active influence models have

787
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,880
Incorporated so far so it turns out if

788
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,920
you if you toss in a neural network

789
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
approximator here

790
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,500
um and uh you know some borrow some

791
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,119
other you know massively parallel

792
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,640
computation techniques uh it also

793
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,380
becomes feasible so it's it's converging

794
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,880
yeah for me it's

795
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,220
what's remarkable is that there's so

796
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,280
many domains of of what we thought was

797
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,119
exclusively human or would be

798
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,780
exclusively human for decades that in

799
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,940
just the past couple years

800
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,339
robots or computers seem to be

801
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:54,000
just as good if not exceeding us

802
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,560
and I don't know if that's promising or

803
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,400
worrisome but anyhow Carl please if you

804
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,660
don't mind answering the question and

805
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,460
then we'll go Anna then Bert and then

806
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,099
Dumas

807
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,920
well actually just reflecting upon your

808
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,820
um

809
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,460
one of your observations I think it's

810
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,520
very difficult to identify one thing uh

811
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,400
you know in a sense

812
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,540
um

813
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,119
what is impressive is the diversity of

814
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,820
advances and applications

815
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,040
um and I just say that because that's

816
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,140
what I was thinking you know over the

817
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,000
past six hours is listening to your

818
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,320
amazing presentation after the

819
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,200
presentation and just you're noting how

820
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,099
diverse yeah and yet there's this Common

821
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,440
Thread this common commitment uh

822
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,420
basically say to your curiosity and and

823
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,540
using the the tools that naturalize that

824
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,060
kind of sense making curious behavior

825
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,680
and communication

826
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,420
um that inherit from sort of either

827
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,660
maths or category Theory or as rough

828
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,480
notes now Quantum information Theory but

829
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,680
just to pick up on a couple of things

830
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,660
which arrive into this conversation so

831
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,400
they work with Chris Fields

832
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,520
um you know it sounds um lovely and

833
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,060
exciting to bring quantum mechanics into

834
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,940
um active inference but that's not the

835
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,920
move that I think Chris has um really

836
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,440
wanting to Champion the move I think is

837
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,780
something that we've all been addressing

838
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,180
in one way or another which is

839
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,119
um leveraging the scale-free aspects of

840
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,359
these this principled

841
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:28,220
approach to

842
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,000
self-organization and hopefully

843
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,859
self-organization to some kind of

844
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,200
generalized synchrony

845
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,180
um so that that's where the quantum

846
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,520
information Theory gets into the game it

847
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,380
is scale free and indeed he will go

848
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,460
further and say it's completely

849
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,560
background for free and everything is

850
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,200
constructed it's just uh so I think that

851
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,760
that's a lovely move

852
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,980
um because once you've gone skill free

853
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,599
you then start to ask deep questions

854
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,180
about how you couple one scale to

855
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,300
another scale and in a sense ecosystems

856
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,119
is just that how do the your the

857
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,280
denizens of an ecosystem

858
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,320
um How is does it constitute how is it

859
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,940
co-constructed what is the structure of

860
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,920
it these are all questions about how one

861
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,140
scale links to another skill so I think

862
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,880
there have been lots of advances in that

863
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,000
direction in many many different fronts

864
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,099
um and you can read that either in terms

865
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,640
of coupling different sort of spatial or

866
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,940
um yeah spatial scales but probably more

867
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,400
importantly sort of temporal scales and

868
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,099
you see that yeah wherever you look

869
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,400
um you'll just come back to what do you

870
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
mean by a narrative it is exactly I

871
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,940
think Anna says it it it's just a a plan

872
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,119
is this a story but notice the story has

873
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,280
a temporal aspect to it you know I have

874
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,500
narratives about being a good person

875
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,180
being a good father being a good

876
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,339
scientist I also have narratives about

877
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,800
you know I want my cup of coffee or I

878
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,320
have to go look after the if I don't but

879
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,839
Ralph has to go look after the child

880
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,839
um so yeah we've all got narratives at

881
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,480
very very different time scales and if

882
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,260
you're

883
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,579
um you know I just came back to Bert's

884
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,619
example of you know I'm an autonomous

885
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,140
vehicle and I'm sentient and we're five

886
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,760
years into the future and I have to

887
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,320
drive around the roundabout you know

888
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,200
what Temple scale and what kind of

889
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,380
Temple course cleaning to define the

890
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,720
narrative in narratives would be

891
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,780
appropriate for that kind of situation

892
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,940
um and um

893
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,619
the you know the the ensuing planning so

894
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,040
um so to my uh so a short answer to your

895
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,839
question I think there have been many

896
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,820
many advances

897
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,000
um they have um I think what they've had

898
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,060
in common is basically transcending

899
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,680
either different domains but in

900
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,060
particular different scales of

901
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,540
application I also agree um with the

902
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,420
notion well another I think important

903
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,700
and pragmatic Advance

904
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,859
um is something that Bert mentioned

905
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,260
which is democratization of this

906
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,900
technology and I think Ralph also into

907
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,880
that you know this is the time you start

908
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,180
using this for the for the common good

909
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,040
um

910
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,099
so I think you know things like um RX

911
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,820
infer and pi mdp and I didn't know about

912
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,460
the the Gaia project uh but it sounds as

913
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,720
though there's been great advances there

914
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,119
as well so this kind of democratization

915
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,040
I think is really important this sort of

916
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,520
socialization everybody can play and

917
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,740
start to sort of um not to talk past

918
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,720
each other I think that that's a that's

919
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,119
a very important uh a very important

920
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,560
advance

921
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,300
and did you say the word scale and

922
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,760
variance or scale Independence

923
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,859
I say scaling variant

924
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,300
um I actually said scale free and I

925
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,859
shouldn't have done that

926
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,780
um I meant

927
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,680
um I I said scale uh scale free so the

928
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,440
the idea that you can apply exactly the

929
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,320
same mechanics and literally for example

930
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,839
say from birth perspective the same kind

931
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,599
of message passing at different space

932
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,300
time scales or

933
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,220
um at different levels in a hierarchical

934
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,660
model so I've actually got a question

935
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,099
for bird

936
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,020
um in terms of reactive message passing

937
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,240
because

938
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,140
reactive means that you don't have to

939
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,400
um prescribe the scheduling but you in

940
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,160
in addressing the problems or the issues

941
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,320
that are entailed by

942
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,359
um having to specify the scheduling of

943
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,300
talking or of message passing

944
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,040
um you your

945
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,560
um you're bound to deal with time and in

946
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,280
a scale invariant context or nested with

947
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,040
nested scales for example you have to

948
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,020
deal with the temp uh the separation of

949
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,839
temporal scales so I I think there's

950
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,400
going to be a very important generic

951
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,800
question which technically but will have

952
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,359
been thinking about furiously for the

953
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,880
past few years and I think implicitly

954
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,200
we're all going to have to be addressing

955
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,460
soon which is the um how do you put that

956
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,040
the timing of your messages when you

957
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,839
make a move or when you listen to a

958
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,220
patient or

959
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,339
um

960
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,740
when you actually pass a message in on a

961
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,240
photograph

962
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,339
um how does how are you gonna how are we

963
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,020
going to be able to put the separation

964
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,180
of time scales

965
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,180
into the architecture in a way that

966
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,300
speaks to this this scale invariance you

967
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,280
know the gear project for example how do

968
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,599
you integrate

969
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,320
um live feed from traffic flow

970
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,339
um sensors with fluctuations in the

971
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,859
climate you know these kinds of this

972
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,980
kind of data comes a very very different

973
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,740
uh Temple scales and yet has to be

974
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,440
assimilated and modeled

975
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,780
um you know

976
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,000
in a way that is also I think has to pay

977
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,460
take you know due courtesy to that

978
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,339
separation of temporal scales

979
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,140
Bert could you please recapitulate the

980
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,119
question for the audience and then begin

981
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,400
to answer it

982
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,599
okay

983
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,380
um

984
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,839
yeah the issue is if you if I mean

985
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,180
active for instance agents are nested

986
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,960
agents and the higher levels

987
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,380
supposed to operate on a larger temporal

988
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,700
scale

989
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,240
but they should they're also working at

990
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,880
a lower resolution right if you if you

991
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,920
look far ahead you don't care as much

992
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
about Precision not that the centimeter

993
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,660
level when I go around to around about I

994
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,400
don't care the centimeter where I land

995
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,319
but if I'm but for the next few

996
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,540
milliseconds I do care about because it

997
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,859
may mean the difference between getting

998
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,540
in the ditch or not

999
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,579
so

1000
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,920
um I don't want to send so the higher

1001
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,440
level I want to look very deep ahead but

1002
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,599
I don't want to send every millisecond

1003
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,440
message to go to to look let's say

1004
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,800
um a minute ahead because so I need to

1005
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,440
space it out a lot but then I may miss

1006
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,240
things

1007
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,660
um so preferably you would just send

1008
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,819
inaccurate messages but that only works

1009
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,980
if you actually have a method

1010
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,940
to Also let's say use less computational

1011
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,040
power to compute a less accurate message

1012
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,520
and we're not good at that yet

1013
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,920
um there there I think I mean what we

1014
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,780
are thinking about is there's an infield

1015
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,420
or a new field but there's a

1016
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,440
a field called probabilistic numerics

1017
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,980
where

1018
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,339
um we are used in in math to just

1019
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:40,920
compute everything very precisely or as

1020
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,599
precise as possible

1021
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,540
and and and and do not care about how

1022
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,060
much computation we spent on it

1023
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,880
um so in probabilistic numerics

1024
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,400
um I I hope we can leverage this for uh

1025
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,980
for message computations

1026
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,319
um I would like to spend let's say

1027
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,420
proportionally less

1028
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,839
computational power on on the accuracy

1029
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,660
of a message One Way possibly would be

1030
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,880
to consider a message a latent variable

1031
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,260
that has an uncertainty by itself

1032
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,339
um but

1033
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,740
I I don't have a a totally clear answer

1034
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,839
for for Carl because we haven't solved

1035
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,339
that either

1036
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:21,780
um but there

1037
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,020
there is a problem in let's say what we

1038
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,140
do on our I mean our computers

1039
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,480
were so completely different from

1040
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,839
computers that from let's say from the

1041
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,839
um from the from the brain

1042
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:40,920
that uh yeah we're spending

1043
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,119
you're spending just too many

1044
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,400
computations on messages that in the end

1045
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,359
are very very inaccurate and that's a

1046
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,819
problem in what we do on our computers

1047
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:52,980
currently

1048
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,119
um

1049
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,339
yeah so I don't know

1050
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,680
how we go I mean what you want to do

1051
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,839
with this on the higher level if you you

1052
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,700
want to look maybe

1053
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,579
um 10 times farther ahead and spent

1054
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,440
about the same amount of computation on

1055
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,020
the lower level that's sort of the uh

1056
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,220
our goal

1057
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,980
and uh but but we don't have an answer

1058
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,420
for that either at the moment

1059
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,520
[Music]

1060
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,099
and and Anna so please feel free to

1061
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,740
comment on or ask a question to anyone

1062
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,200
yeah well I mean I you know I don't I

1063
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,839
don't have uh anything to contribute

1064
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,599
unfortunately to how computers work but

1065
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,819
I can tell you that this idea of

1066
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:35,160
temporal scales is something that we

1067
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,980
Face often in our work with patients

1068
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,079
um for example addicted patients are

1069
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,319
very focused on short-term rewards and

1070
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,839
it's it's a fact in fact their ability

1071
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,300
to control how they feel in the moment

1072
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,700
that is partially what drives the

1073
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,339
addiction so when when I try to adopt

1074
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,800
url's language of minimizing surprise or

1075
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,900
minimizing free entropy

1076
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,940
that's one of the things that people are

1077
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,520
trying to do on a short-term time scale

1078
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,740
when they become addicted so I have a

1079
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,420
young woman who's addicted to nitrous

1080
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,300
oxide which has a very fast onset of

1081
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,520
intoxication over the order of seconds

1082
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,760
and a very fast offset and she says that

1083
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,560
that's exactly what she likes about it

1084
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,660
because she's controlling it second by

1085
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,560
second

1086
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,960
so when we work with patients to get

1087
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,040
them out of that short temporal Horizon

1088
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,160
we actually rely more and more on action

1089
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,339
and having them change something in

1090
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:34,140
their lives namely abstain from their

1091
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,140
drug of choice for long enough to kind

1092
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,099
of completely reset their brains and to

1093
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,859
allow them to see this longer temporal

1094
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,079
because when they're chasing this short

1095
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,839
control they're actually not able to see

1096
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:52,380
themselves in the longer narrative Arc

1097
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,079
of their lives so that's that was that's

1098
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,880
what comes to mind for me I don't think

1099
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,260
it's going to be helpful to people who

1100
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,060
are trying to build computers but that's

1101
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,280
that's the kinds of interventions that I

1102
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,140
make with humans

1103
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,540
I have a question about that so you

1104
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,760
mentioned control in the short term and

1105
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,359
you've also mentioned that you study the

1106
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:15,119
positive effects of having a higher

1107
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,339
power in your life or or Surrender okay

1108
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,319
I kind of give the punch line Away by

1109
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,700
saying surrendering to the higher power

1110
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,400
where I was going was okay what's the

1111
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,859
association between seeing yourself in

1112
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,900
the largest time frame and a higher

1113
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,359
power and then also is there something

1114
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:33,960
that is akin to giving up control

1115
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,900
when you yeah look farther and farther

1116
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,640
into the future such a great yeah that's

1117
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,740
right like at the heart of what I'm very

1118
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,359
interested in because it's a real

1119
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:45,000
Paradox right it's this kind of locus of

1120
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,940
control within ourselves that really in

1121
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,040
modern culture we think is a great thing

1122
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,920
but when that's taken to an extreme and

1123
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,660
one example of that is addictive

1124
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,300
behaviors it's very bad for people and

1125
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,900
for communities and so what can be what

1126
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,180
can pull people out of that is this kind

1127
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,220
of surrender to a to a higher power

1128
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,740
giving up that locus of control locating

1129
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,660
that locus of control outside themselves

1130
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,540
not not necessarily like in a theistic

1131
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,619
sense

1132
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,359
um one of the things you know that they

1133
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,040
talk about an alcoholic synonymous for

1134
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,420
example is

1135
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,680
um you know you don't have to believe in

1136
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,599
God it just doesn't it's just not you

1137
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,280
you're not you know you're not driving

1138
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,160
it and so I would be very curious from

1139
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,079
the perspective of ural's understanding

1140
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,819
of active inference and the free energy

1141
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:32,280
principle and how the brain works why is

1142
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,420
it that um sort of embracing our

1143
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,960
inability to control what happens in our

1144
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,599
lives can actually be the very source of

1145
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,819
healing especially embedded in this

1146
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:48,060
really kind of over controlled yeah I

1147
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,260
would even go so far as to say

1148
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,540
endemically narcissistic culture like

1149
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,760
I'm really curious I I don't want to

1150
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,980
take the conversation you know in a

1151
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,480
Direction please please that's a

1152
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,940
fantastic question so if anyone has a

1153
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,140
comment on that please

1154
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,119
oh I have some thought

1155
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,819
uh and I think this applies

1156
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:13,859
um supplies both at the personal level

1157
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:16,500
and at the at the global level and I

1158
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,020
think it has to do with the the my quote

1159
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,839
from earlier uh brought by Edward

1160
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,839
Fullbrook that uh if you're falling from

1161
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,119
a plane yes maybe an altimeter and some

1162
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,220
instruments uh might be useful but what

1163
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,960
you really need is a parachute right so

1164
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,579
we have this

1165
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,819
um uh we have this uh presupposition

1166
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:39,839
that that are whatever like framing we

1167
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,880
have we have operating in our day-to-day

1168
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,140
is going to be okay this this is the

1169
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,720
right Framing and it's gonna it tends to

1170
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,200
be the this uh this rational scientific

1171
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,040
uh framing of of okay very very linear

1172
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,839
uh consequence for for for most stuff

1173
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:59,579
and it turns out that even like if you

1174
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:02,400
inspect or or day-to-day Behavior you

1175
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,319
know bigger more complicated models are

1176
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,599
not necessarily better which is where we

1177
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:09,480
get uh the success of heuristics under a

1178
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,420
bounded computation boundary rationality

1179
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,740
uh and uh if you scale it up to to uh a

1180
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,920
billion humans interacted in a in a

1181
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,680
resources Planet you know a world of

1182
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,440
possibilities but also of challenges

1183
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,079
then you just you have to we have to

1184
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,280
like drastically lower our our uh our

1185
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,079
bar for

1186
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,480
yes how much Metro we have but also even

1187
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,180
like how much was where does uh

1188
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,920
information gathering which diminishing

1189
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,140
returns where does modeling reach uh

1190
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,660
diminishing returns uh there's a whole

1191
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,760
literature on uh in the business World

1192
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,559
about the expected value of information

1193
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,839
how much you should actually invest but

1194
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,020
also in science is also uh known as uh

1195
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,819
optimal experiment design where

1196
00:51:56,819 --> 00:52:00,000
basically you know acknowledging that uh

1197
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,059
that you have a limited budget in terms

1198
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,440
of how much you can act and how much you

1199
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,540
can probe and how much you can how much

1200
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,540
time you can spend thinking about stuff

1201
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,760
and uh I think what we're doing when we

1202
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,640
feel like burned out or or exhausted

1203
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,880
from from overthinking uh or in Italy

1204
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,579
feeling that that okay we've gone too

1205
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,480
high and we need uh we need to to uh

1206
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,339
give ourselves education give ourselves

1207
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:29,520
some uh some uh some free time here I

1208
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,099
think that doing this on a principle in

1209
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,920
a principled way we're just not not just

1210
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,359
like taking the heuristics and the

1211
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:39,180
signals that are that we inherit from

1212
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,920
from Evolution but actually being able

1213
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,980
to figure out uh collaboratively and uh

1214
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,400
and with with some rigor okay this is uh

1215
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,800
we don't need to know exactly how much

1216
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,780
how many degrees the world is going to

1217
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,780
warm uh by 2000 2100 in order to know

1218
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,180
that maybe it's a good idea to to start

1219
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,920
doing something about the amount of of

1220
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,420
carbon in the atmosphere or whatever

1221
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,420
right uh and so I think this leads to

1222
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,480
this this this no knowledge this idea of

1223
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,119
a real knowledge economy and of things

1224
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,160
like abstraction as a service how can

1225
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,900
you actually

1226
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,920
um how can you actually build in

1227
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,579
um

1228
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,319
building this this kind of like

1229
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,339
sophisticated and uh and

1230
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,160
um sophisticated translation layers that

1231
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,260
take some of this burden from from

1232
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,880
ourselves as individuals and even as

1233
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,940
organizations right uh and just put it

1234
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,520
out in the world as as value-added

1235
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,599
Services which is what they are

1236
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,680
in Guillaume if you have any statements

1237
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,040
or questions or retorts then please feel

1238
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,700
free uh yeah thanks uh now I was still

1239
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,400
uh also uh thinking about the recent

1240
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,500
breakthrough post 2020 in actually

1241
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,040
inference uh to to me like they were

1242
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,520
like theoretical uh progress that were

1243
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,920
very interesting uh we heard already

1244
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,980
about the the formalism majority of the

1245
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,359
mathematical level between military

1246
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,780
scale and scale free aspect

1247
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,059
um I I really liked or so the the

1248
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:17,099
development of a more multi-agent

1249
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:18,839
perspective of active insurance it's

1250
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,200
very interesting like uh especially like

1251
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,940
for instance the

1252
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,119
seeing military agent systems we just

1253
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,339
heard about like even society as well

1254
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:33,420
like as many as one of a system or many

1255
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,619
as many subsystems and how we can uh use

1256
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:40,020
maybe those formalisms to also deal with

1257
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,480
policy making that's very interesting

1258
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,140
venue and uh the emergence of norms

1259
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,079
culture and ideas or so on because

1260
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,480
um one thing that I'm still struggling

1261
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,460
with in in the case of active inference

1262
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,359
models is like how to get outside the

1263
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:00,599
checkerboard uh you you can put a lot in

1264
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,440
the in the model a priori and uh how you

1265
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,960
make the model creating new stuff that

1266
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,020
is not backed inside at the first and I

1267
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,440
on that like one very uh interesting

1268
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,420
breakthrough was the application of

1269
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,640
active inference to morphogenesis I

1270
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,200
really like the the work that has been

1271
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,220
done on that

1272
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,819
and on the technical aspects I think the

1273
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:28,619
the two main uh Focus that I love are uh

1274
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:30,599
all the Deep active inference and how to

1275
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,339
scale up uh actually in front because

1276
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:34,619
it's a strong limitation for the

1277
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:38,400
adoption of the the formation uh if it's

1278
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,760
not scale enough compared to other

1279
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,640
framework like deep learning and then

1280
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,040
um the the link with empirical data I

1281
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,900
really like for instance the the work of

1282
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,319
uh Ryan Smith and how to connect with uh

1283
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,800
electrophysiology and clinical data and

1284
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,599
I think it's also something very

1285
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,420
important to Anchor

1286
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,359
uh the theory in in the real world and

1287
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,480
have like a fancifiability and empirical

1288
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,720
validation of those models

1289
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,400
and what are some of the applications of

1290
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,900
active inference to morphogenesis

1291
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,140
so well I'm not the expert Erica would

1292
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,839
be the the best to answer that but uh I

1293
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,520
was referring to the the work with

1294
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,000
Michael Levin and how a mother can uh

1295
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,720
help to create a sort of embryogenesis

1296
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,640
uh

1297
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,400
so maybe Carl you can explain better

1298
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,540
than me

1299
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,140
please yeah I don't have a reputation

1300
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,160
for explaining things very clearly

1301
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,200
but yeah that's absolutely right

1302
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,540
um it was just at work with Michael Evan

1303
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,800
and colleagues

1304
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,880
um uh showing that um you can get quite

1305
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,420
expressive and bimetic out in the

1306
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,740
formation and movement of different

1307
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,099
cells into an organization

1308
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,380
um often described in terms of

1309
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,380
morphogenesis

1310
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,200
um simply by

1311
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,720
communicating your beliefs

1312
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,640
um so I'm coming back to this sort of

1313
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,339
cross-cutting theme of communication so

1314
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:18,859
if you just broadcast

1315
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:21,500
your beliefs and you're a little fell

1316
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,420
and you have um there are a little

1317
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,760
ensemblance of cells and they all have

1318
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,359
the shared charity model that includes

1319
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,000
if I was in this position I would sense

1320
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,839
that now they all have exactly the same

1321
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,520
generative model the same predictions

1322
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,160
the same expectations

1323
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,260
um and they're all

1324
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,819
um broadcasting their beliefs about

1325
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:46,800
where they are and the free energy

1326
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,200
minimizing solution is just when they're

1327
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,460
all in a place that they except that

1328
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,540
they

1329
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,160
um receive signals that they would

1330
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,020
expect to to

1331
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,180
um receive when they're in this place

1332
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,520
and of course if that is the same for

1333
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,440
everybody there's only one Arrangement

1334
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,780
where each cell Finds Its place so

1335
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,520
basically it's just knowing your place

1336
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,700
is is an immersion property of making

1337
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,940
the world mutually predictable through

1338
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,240
communication so

1339
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,800
you know a deflationary account of

1340
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,540
morphogenesis

1341
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,240
um but the game I thought you know one

1342
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,540
of your units is precision Psychiatry so

1343
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,920
I thought you're going to talk about

1344
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,119
Precision so I'm going to do a game now

1345
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,440
he talked about morphogenesis I'm going

1346
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,319
to talk about Precision now but I think

1347
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:39,240
there's there's a that's a really nice

1348
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,839
way just to pick up on themes which uh

1349
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:45,059
everybody's just mentioned and in

1350
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,940
particular the pathology of precision uh

1351
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,180
and by Precision you can reposition in

1352
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,160
the sense that Bert was talking about in

1353
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,760
terms of do you use an unsigned integer

1354
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,160
or a double you know how much can my

1355
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,599
course grain to my numeric

1356
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:03,119
representation or you can use it in

1357
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,740
terms of course grading in the sense of

1358
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,780
the renormalization group you know it's

1359
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,940
just chunking things in hours or years

1360
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,339
as opposed to milliseconds and minutes

1361
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,160
or you can look at it in terms of a

1362
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,880
statistician and describing the

1363
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,880
reliability or the inverse variance of a

1364
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,059
signal because we have to estimate that

1365
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,880
um when I say we I mean uh your agents

1366
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,180
and statisticians and and act

1367
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,819
accordingly and certainly

1368
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,980
um in the active in the work of Ryan

1369
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,359
Smith uh on addiction much of the sort

1370
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,460
of mathematical explanation for these

1371
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,900
addictive locked in OCD like a phenomena

1372
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,299
rests upon a failure to get that coarse

1373
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:51,359
grading that Precision estimation right

1374
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,040
um

1375
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,260
the reason I I I wonder whether it be

1376
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,660
just worthwhile revisiting

1377
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,099
um

1378
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:02,579
um addiction and psychopathology of its

1379
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,099
only pathology of Behavior Uh from the

1380
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,799
point of view of getting Precision wrong

1381
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:10,020
and certainly assigning too much

1382
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,880
Precision to low level processing which

1383
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,339
is what Bert wants to avoid doing

1384
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:17,339
um It just strikes me that that kind of

1385
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:22,200
story also has mileage in terms of why

1386
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,420
we are in a state of paralysis when it

1387
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,520
comes to climate change because I also

1388
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,839
notice gear that you talked about

1389
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,339
climate action I've never heard that

1390
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:32,160
before but that seems to me to be the

1391
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,500
important thing why isn't there any

1392
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,799
climate action and Anna you know what it

1393
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:39,000
would be like you going to the clinic

1394
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,680
and finding some of the Parkinson's

1395
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,440
disease why isn't this person moving you

1396
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,540
know

1397
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,119
and interestingly the the computational

1398
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,540
explanation for Parkinson's Disease is

1399
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,119
assigning too much Precision to the

1400
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:55,680
evidence that you're not moving before

1401
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,859
you move so you know if you don't if you

1402
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,960
can't ignore the fact that nothing is

1403
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,420
changing or your pride beliefs your

1404
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,980
predictions that I'm going to stand up

1405
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,960
are going to initiate walking

1406
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,119
don't get a look at because they are

1407
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,799
immediately canceled because they've

1408
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,960
assigned too much Precision to the lower

1409
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,299
level processing and I'm just wondering

1410
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:17,220
whether that that's something that that

1411
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,160
kind of pathology is exactly what the

1412
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,819
the you know what what Ralph is Ralph is

1413
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:27,420
trying to reverse by having you know uh

1414
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,520
morals that have recommendations at hand

1415
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,859
that provide a more coarse grained view

1416
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,900
of things a deeper view

1417
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,000
um

1418
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,640
Anna would you like to comment on that

1419
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,000
yeah well I just I love I love this idea

1420
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,280
of the pathology of precision because I

1421
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,559
think it it manifests in so many

1422
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,900
different ways

1423
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,240
um you know not just among my patient

1424
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,520
population but I think it's almost like

1425
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,660
a like a cultural sickness in a way

1426
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,839
um you know the ways in which we we seem

1427
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:04,680
like obsessed with certain types of data

1428
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,200
and we're missing the big picture so I'm

1429
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,640
gonna I'm gonna think more about that

1430
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,160
I'm gonna read more about it I really

1431
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,660
appreciate the discussions interesting

1432
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,799
for me

1433
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,839
and Anna when you're referring to the

1434
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,420
Pathology of precision do you mean so in

1435
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,720
a more conscious sense that we're over

1436
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,880
evaluating something that we don't need

1437
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,780
to whereas Carl you're referring to it

1438
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,880
in an unconscious sense like the brain

1439
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,900
is

1440
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,640
putting too much Precision on something

1441
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,680
because in Parkinson's it's it's not

1442
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,180
like you consciously are putting

1443
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,180
Precision in a place

1444
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,579
well I think you could look at it sort

1445
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:43,859
of like in both cases when I think about

1446
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:45,599
addiction

1447
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,799
um you know people aren't doing it

1448
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:50,220
consciously it's that they really do

1449
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,740
um see this as adaptive and healthy and

1450
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,599
also even on some level they can't do

1451
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:57,720
otherwise and they're not able to see

1452
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,000
the true impact of their drug use on

1453
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,680
their lives they're genuinely not able

1454
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,680
to see the negative consequences I mean

1455
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,020
that's that's what contributes to

1456
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,480
getting caught in that vortex

1457
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,359
but I mean you could also see it as part

1458
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:13,079
of

1459
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:15,359
what's happened culturally like for

1460
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,740
example like the whole Wellness

1461
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,780
industrial complex the way that we now

1462
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,940
count ourselves

1463
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,079
um you know through all these different

1464
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,299
devices and if we could just count our

1465
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:25,980
breathing and count our heart rate and

1466
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,559
take supplements you know then we would

1467
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,559
somehow reach some levitating state of

1468
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,200
precise wellness and I don't know I mean

1469
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,480
you know just kind of visit all this is

1470
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,180
all kind of new new ideas for me

1471
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,099
that's interesting so you believe that

1472
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:44,280
we can be inundated with Health Data and

1473
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,680
that that's detrimental to us oh

1474
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,380
absolutely I see that all the time

1475
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,839
uh-huh so for me I used to have uh okay

1476
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,520
maybe I'll take this out of the well

1477
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,740
this is going out live

1478
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,599
okay let me be

1479
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:58,859
let me figure out how to say this

1480
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:00,960
diplomatic diplomatically I used to have

1481
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,940
a device that would measure my heart

1482
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,000
rate let's say that and and my sleep and

1483
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,339
instead of improving my sleep it led to

1484
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:10,440
me becoming obsessed with it and then

1485
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,599
noticing oh I didn't sleep well I must

1486
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,099
not be feeling good today as well

1487
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,839
because apparently there's a high

1488
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,520
connection between how your Sleep

1489
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,799
Quality that's exactly it plus added to

1490
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:21,599
that the other layer that

1491
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,140
I should be able to control it right so

1492
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,900
with all of this data and information I

1493
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,700
should be able to I don't know reduce

1494
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,799
free entropy or whatever how to produce

1495
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:34,740
surprise as you guys talk about

1496
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,480
um you know and I think that's obviously

1497
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,119
that only goes so far and then can

1498
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,160
actually contribute to our misery

1499
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,880
because we're why aren't we all you know

1500
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,240
levitating like the Buddha or whatever

1501
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,680
um you know when we have all these tools

1502
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,880
and we can pay attention to all this

1503
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,040
data so

1504
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,559
I see this also with people who have

1505
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,380
productivity tools so and not only that

1506
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,559
but mechanical keyboards let's say

1507
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,180
some the reason why I don't have a

1508
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,380
mechanical keyboard even though I think

1509
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,859
I'd love it is because I know that why

1510
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:09,180
the heck do I care about the clicking

1511
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,339
sound of a keyboard but if I got one

1512
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:12,599
then I'd be like well what's the

1513
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:13,799
difference between clicking sound a

1514
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:15,240
versus clicking sound B versus clicking

1515
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,819
sound C and I become obsessed with the

1516
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:19,740
trappings of productivity that is

1517
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,660
sharpening so-called sharpening the ax

1518
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,460
rather than cutting down the tree

1519
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,460
there's this phrase that is apocryphal

1520
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,400
and it said it's attributed to I think

1521
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,599
yeah

1522
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:31,859
Lincoln

1523
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:34,020
which is that he'd spend 80 of his time

1524
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,000
or half the time sharpening the knife

1525
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,339
than cutting the tree and when you just

1526
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:39,780
if you just think and then this is just

1527
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,819
echoed in productivity circles but it

1528
01:05:41,819 --> 01:05:43,799
just it can't be the case why would you

1529
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:45,240
spend so much time sharpening your ex

1530
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,680
like look at anyone who cuts down a tree

1531
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,359
with an X most of the time they're not

1532
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:49,619
doing that

1533
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:51,180
anyhow

1534
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,520
so if anyone has any comments on on what

1535
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,280
was just said please

1536
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,940
can can I uh just talk about what I find

1537
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,799
an exciting in my Fields about access

1538
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:04,319
sure sure yes

1539
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,020
um I read it was a long time ago but

1540
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,339
there was a paper

1541
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,980
um and it it's about that it says well

1542
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,900
active inference is not really a

1543
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,799
scientific Loop because it's biased and

1544
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,559
um and I read that and the the

1545
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,020
sound of the paper was kind of sort of

1546
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,640
just so it's not good

1547
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,280
but I think you know active influence is

1548
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,260
is maybe not a science book it's an

1549
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,299
engineering Loop because there's bias

1550
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,160
and we need buyers in engineering we

1551
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,420
need to make stuff we need to build

1552
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,180
stuff we need to have a biased so it's

1553
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:39,059
an engineering design cycle I see that

1554
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:42,059
everywhere around me

1555
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:45,960
um and active inference could be

1556
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,480
um a complete breakthrough in in

1557
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,980
engineering right

1558
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,940
um the fields around me are signal

1559
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,619
processing I myself in a signal

1560
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:57,720
processing uh

1561
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,319
department or group and everybody builds

1562
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:02,700
algorithms

1563
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,460
for us I mean elective interest agents

1564
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,640
it's influence of States then the floor

1565
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,099
below me they build Control Systems well

1566
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:13,020
it's influence over actions

1567
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,720
then other people are working on machine

1568
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,960
learning influence over parameters

1569
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,299
active infants could be and you'll like

1570
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:24,480
this curve it's a very deflationary view

1571
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,420
on uh on engineering because everything

1572
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,960
is just inference and so rather than

1573
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,119
building

1574
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:34,799
algorithms everywhere if we become

1575
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:38,299
really good at implementing

1576
01:07:38,299 --> 01:07:42,299
minimization we will we will be able to

1577
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:45,000
build a great engineering design cycles

1578
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,920
and and we'll be engineering better

1579
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,980
machines for us or yeah

1580
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,200
you know for medical procedures or for

1581
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,420
other things that are important so it

1582
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,579
has a tremendous uh application

1583
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:59,460
potential in engineering

1584
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,859
um in in engineering I think in most

1585
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:03,599
many fields

1586
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,180
people have sort of drifted in different

1587
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,539
directions control theorists have I mean

1588
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:11,160
they do almost the same thing as signal

1589
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,020
processing people but they speak a

1590
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,579
different language now

1591
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:18,420
and you know so uh and everybody and and

1592
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,060
Signal processing people

1593
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,620
it's a completely different group from

1594
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,238
the machine learning people but it's all

1595
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,460
information processing and this brings

1596
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,580
it uh this field can bring it together

1597
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,238
uh so I think it's the

1598
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:37,140
if but the thing is that in order to

1599
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,899
to make it successful in engineering we

1600
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:43,620
need to build an application that uh

1601
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,319
well that impresses right that it's not

1602
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,719
like a tic-tac-toe thing that it really

1603
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,939
needs to impress people it's to be

1604
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:52,439
better than

1605
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:53,939
you know there's some other control

1606
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:57,000
systems but once we do that I think

1607
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,040
there's tremendous uh application

1608
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,439
potential because there haven't been

1609
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,719
enormous breakthroughs in Signal

1610
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:05,399
processing and control the last big

1611
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:07,140
breakthrough

1612
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,000
I think it was common filtering and this

1613
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,238
was 1960s and and I mean it's it's kind

1614
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,040
of uh it's kind of funny that the

1615
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,779
essence of what we do in active interest

1616
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:18,839
is also carbon filtering so

1617
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,880
um that's uh yeah I think there's

1618
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,060
tremendous opportunities for for what we

1619
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,060
do here for uh for engineering

1620
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:29,759
so that's why that's why it's exciting

1621
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,979
to me

1622
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:33,600
and do you mind expanding on what you

1623
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,060
said about acting and therapists should

1624
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,859
be helping their patients with that

1625
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:40,738
oh uh sure just so I mean one of my

1626
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:42,960
critiques of uh you know mental health

1627
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,479
treatment today is that there's not

1628
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:46,979
enough

1629
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,299
um

1630
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:50,040
there's not enough encouragement of

1631
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,560
patients to actually go and act

1632
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,179
differently in the world as a way of

1633
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:56,460
gathering data instead of it often ends

1634
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,020
up being kind of this

1635
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,380
World building between therapists and

1636
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,500
patients not not necessarily ultimately

1637
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,580
adaptive in the world so I was really

1638
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,440
just kind of responding to what rap was

1639
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,880
saying that we need to act in the world

1640
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,960
I think that's

1641
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,360
more true now

1642
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,460
um in you know modern Rich Nations than

1643
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,280
ever before because we are so incredibly

1644
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,320
sedentary and interactive of course

1645
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,239
we're interacting with a virtual world

1646
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:22,320
and that's

1647
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,260
you know good and bad but I mean I think

1648
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,780
we need to be actually acting in the

1649
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,100
world

1650
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,080
hmm

1651
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,360
and so there's there's different forms

1652
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,280
of therapy as you as you know there's

1653
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,960
talk therapy and then there's also

1654
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,460
cognitive behavioral therapy or

1655
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,460
Psychotherapy and top therapy but but

1656
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,260
cognitive behavioral therapy as far as I

1657
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,840
understand focuses on on the actions is

1658
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,560
that incorrect or

1659
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,380

01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,040
um

1661
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,780
I mean for you know again treating

1662
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,520
addiction like you're you're not going

1663
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,679
to really get that far with cognitive

1664
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:00,120
behavioral therapy or anything that's

1665
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,159
focused on just emotions and cognitions

1666
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,280
people have to go out and actually

1667
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,440
um try stop using their stopping their

1668
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,940
substance or their addictive behaviors

1669
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,580
and gather data from that experience and

1670
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,159
then come back and process it

1671
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,960
mm-hmm

1672
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,820
so Anna in your field and this question

1673
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,219
will go to everyone but in in your field

1674
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:22,739
in what you study where is the largest

1675
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:25,679
gap that you would like to see closed

1676
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,840
well I mean we're facing a huge Mental

1677
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,540
Health crisis now we have more and more

1678
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,360
young people coming in with depression

1679
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,120
anxiety suicidality addictions of all

1680
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,400
sorts and these are not necessarily

1681
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,100
people who are struggling by virtue of

1682
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,520
trauma or socioeconomic disparity these

1683
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,020
are people who have really privileged

1684
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,440
lives in many instances so it's uh it's

1685
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,780
really a puzzle you know what what is

1686
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,880
going on for people and I think a big

1687
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,739
part of it is

1688
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:57,540
the fact that people are not having

1689
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,480
embodied experiences they're not having

1690
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,060
experiences in the world

1691
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,400
um and and also the experiences that

1692
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,960
they are having are

1693
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,360
you know these kinds of very quick fixes

1694
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,560
and

1695
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,640
um fast Pleasures so

1696
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,199
I think noticing I think you know the

1697
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:19,860
the co-created sort of models through

1698
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,960
healthier communication that allow

1699
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,420
people to feel part of a community and

1700
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,640
also to have like truthful co-created

1701
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,679
narratives trying to use the language

1702
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,060
here

1703
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,640
um I think that's really important

1704
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,900
so for example one of the things

1705
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,820
mentioned once he's excited about one of

1706
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,020
the things I'm excited about in the

1707
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,360
field of addiction medicine is mutual

1708
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,120
support and the proliferation of things

1709
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,920
like Alcoholics Anonymous but also other

1710
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,780
mutual help help groups a lot of them

1711
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,840
existing now online and the way that

1712
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,739
people are together creating healthier

1713
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:55,620
narratives enacted together to

1714
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,480
counteract a lot of the unhealthy

1715
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,219
narratives that I think are driving a

1716
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:02,360
lot of decision making today

1717
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,100
I wanted to know is there a correlation

1718
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,500
between the rise in mental health or

1719
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,420
sorry mental illness or mental health

1720
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,500
issues whatever we want to call it and

1721
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,840
at a certain trait of people like is it

1722
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,760
affecting every is it affecting the

1723
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,080
population

1724
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,719
the same so the whole population has

1725
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:24,360
raised 20 in terms of how many mental

1726
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,219
health issues they have per year or is

1727
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:27,600
it affecting people who deal with

1728
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,280
abstractions more and more so for

1729
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,920
instance we're talking over zoom and

1730
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,140
some people study abstractions just like

1731
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,900
us and then there's some people who

1732
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,420
whose work it is to to do something

1733
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,380
physical like running or or swim like is

1734
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,300
it affecting everyone equally or are you

1735
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,699
noticing that there's some broad trend

1736
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:49,679
well the broad trends that are out there

1737
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,960
are just correlational but the more time

1738
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,880
that people will spend in the virtual

1739
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,739
world the more likely they are to suffer

1740
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,600
from depression anxiety and other mental

1741
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,400
health problems

1742
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,780
um you know people haven't really been

1743
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,640
able to narrow that down to specific

1744
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,620
content but they have been able to save

1745
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,420
just the sheer amount of time that

1746
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,940
spending that you're spending online

1747
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,500
increases your risk for certain mental

1748
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,520
health you know poor mental health

1749
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,350
outcomes

1750
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,920
[Music]

1751
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,000
um

1752
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,780
okay now Carl well again if anyone has

1753
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,460
any comments or questions please just

1754
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,920
raise your physical hand I can see that

1755
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,360
and okay Raph Ralph Raphael sorry no I

1756
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,100
was just gonna say that uh I think

1757
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:33,840
another uh notable trend is that and I

1758
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,400
just saw somebody see this on YouTube

1759
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,880
yet just yesterday that uh uh young

1760
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,800
people or this proportionately affected

1761
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,500
by things like climate grief because

1762
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,940
they're the ones that are going to be

1763
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,219
alive to deal with it

1764
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:50,280
um and uh I think that applies more

1765
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,900
generally that you know Peter Sandy

1766
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,580
already like 30 years or something ago

1767
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,679
uh wrote about the inescapable network

1768
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,820
of neutrality the reality that that uh

1769
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,179
that what what we do affects each other

1770
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:06,480
right and we built we we took advantage

1771
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,920
of this huge resource buffer that's

1772
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,820
called uh the biosphere and uh and uh

1773
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,699
and and Earth to to pretend that it

1774
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:16,380
didn't for

1775
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:18,600
um for quite a long time and you know

1776
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,300
got got a lot of mileage out of it but

1777
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,460
it's uh now we're at a point where we

1778
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,980
know that there's there's a uh a whole

1779
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,780
generation of people that are coming to

1780
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,880
grip so the fact that

1781
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,679
um I'm gonna stop myself from seeing a

1782
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,560
swear word but oh my God we need to uh

1783
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,300
we actually need to change everything

1784
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,500
about

1785
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,300
everything about everything that we do

1786
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:43,440
and and we need to do it fast and uh and

1787
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,140
by the way that it's not just uh what we

1788
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,900
do in uh

1789
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,460
it's not just what we do out there it's

1790
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,860
also what we do inside our get ready for

1791
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,080
for how to show up for Life internally

1792
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,960
right so no wonder that that it has that

1793
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,900
impacts like my myself I've dealt with

1794
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,020
anxiety and uh and uh and a lot of of

1795
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,780
other things we've had conversations

1796
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,340
about what what are we doing bringing a

1797
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,380
daughter into this world and all these

1798
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,940
kinds of things I think it's it's only

1799
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,940
natural that that it's it's coming to a

1800
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,440
head in this way right now

1801
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:21,000
Neil you have your hand up and I can't

1802
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,320
see you

1803
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,239
yes

1804
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,280
um yeah it's connect with the what has

1805
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,760
just been said uh so and your initial

1806
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,280
question of that the the gaps that needs

1807
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,100
to be closed I think like uh the scale

1808
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,260
spree model of health and mental health

1809
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:41,340
particularly would be great like uh we

1810
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,880
are in silos in biomedical research and

1811
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,739
uh the fact that someone is

1812
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:50,520
uh having depression can come from uh

1813
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,219
interacting genes as much as interacting

1814
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:57,659
people and uh also is related to climate

1815
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:02,219
change and so on so how we can have a

1816
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:05,100
new health systems that doesn't deal

1817
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,020
with those silos and integrate those

1818
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,020
different skills to me it's like really

1819
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:13,260
a big challenge but a challenge that uh

1820
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,080
current models and work that we can see

1821
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,420
going that direction and I'm very

1822
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:21,440
enthusiastic about that

1823
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,920
Bert

1824
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:28,020
um

1825
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,360
yeah the um

1826
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,060
well I in in my field in engineering

1827
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,480
active inference is not understood

1828
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,620
because almost all papers are written by

1829
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,540
neuroscientists and they're hard to read

1830
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:46,980
so I was really happy to hear today that

1831
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,219
I think it's Sanjeev namjoshi who who is

1832
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:52,380
writing an engineering book on active

1833
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,900
inference so that I think it will really

1834
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,580
help

1835
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,920
um that together with the availability

1836
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,080
of good toolboxes for implementing

1837
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,420
active inference should make a lot of

1838
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,060
Engineers uh much more enthusiastic

1839
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,600
about active influence because that's uh

1840
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,960
it's not something that is

1841
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,480
and it's not understood at the moment in

1842
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,080
engineering circles so I hope that the

1843
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,239
book will be good because that I'm

1844
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:24,320
enthusiastic about that

1845
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,580
and Carl

1846
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,860
where where are some

1847
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:31,560
gaps in the in your research that you'd

1848
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,580
like to see addressed

1849
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,920
um

1850
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,400
oh empty space out there yet to be um

1851
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,140
explored

1852
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,060
um but in terms of

1853
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,020
um

1854
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,900
in in terms of what seems to be emerging

1855
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,440
from um the session and specifically the

1856
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,179
past few

1857
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:59,159
um answers it it does seem to be um

1858
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:02,760
important to have

1859
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,120
um this very generic just to take births

1860
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,300
um sort of line that this is just one

1861
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,460
deflationary simple and probably the

1862
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,460
right way to understand stuff and to

1863
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,800
make recommendations or to

1864
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,040
um describe people's actions possibly to

1865
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,640
themselves in a therapeutic uh context

1866
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,040
um and as such it should be push button

1867
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,620
technology and it should be democratized

1868
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,659
and socialized and

1869
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:32,699
um I I think that's the challenge

1870
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,260
practically

1871
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,179
um and what one may ask why would you

1872
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:37,739
want to do that

1873
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,440
um for me that there are two

1874
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,260
um clear imperatives

1875
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,820
um one is

1876
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:48,060
um very abstract and it's not really my

1877
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:50,640
uh um within my comfort zone and the

1878
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,140
other one is in my cumbersome another

1879
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:55,080
one that's outside my comfort zone as

1880
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,500
um is um this notion of

1881
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,600
um

1882
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,060
interactivity and Hyper connectivity in

1883
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,520
them and and The Meta crisis that we we

1884
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,080
heard about

1885
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,440
um and um and our game also refer to

1886
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,480
this in terms of what he was trying he

1887
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,300
was trying to distinguish between a

1888
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,159
Californian notion of optimality and

1889
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:20,400
another kind another way forward

1890
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,219
um and to me it's it's it's you know a

1891
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:25,679
stark contrast with growth is good

1892
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,880
versus sustainability and of course the

1893
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,679
maths of the free energy principle is

1894
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,199
just about sustainability it's just a

1895
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:37,500
description of the physics of systems

1896
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,600
random dynamical systems that

1897
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,760
self-organized to some non-equilibrium

1898
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,760
steady state and that is what we are

1899
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,520
um so you know for me there's something

1900
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,520
deeply if you like apt about the free

1901
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,320
energy principle and its coronal risk

1902
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,480
such as active inference in application

1903
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,600
to ecosystems and lived ecosystems and

1904
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,440
realized ecosystems so if that if those

1905
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,860
basic principles can be brought back

1906
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,520
um into globalization uh into the you

1907
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,520
know into the market into fintech into

1908
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,520
um social media into politics into your

1909
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,980
climate action I think that would be a

1910
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,060
good thing

1911
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,620
um I'm just mindful of you know this

1912
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,820
struck me in a number of the

1913
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,100
presentations today

1914
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,900
um you remember before Bert was saying

1915
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,699
if you look at the brain which is a

1916
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,739
really lovely example of a

1917
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:30,300
self-organizing system to a

1918
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,580
non-equilibrium steady state

1919
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,040
um then it's empty and what did he mean

1920
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,120
by that it didn't mean you were

1921
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,940
empty-headed what he meant was it's

1922
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,699
incredibly sparsely connected

1923
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:44,640
now that tells you immediately that a

1924
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,860
pathology of connectivity is hyper

1925
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,900
connective to overconnectivity which

1926
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,340
immediately

1927
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,840
um well it made me very alert to

1928
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,120
um the presentation of the meta crisis

1929
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,300
that one of the first three things that

1930
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,699
was uh and underwrote them the the

1931
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,980
metacris or you know the current crisis

1932
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,159
were kind of intending with is a

1933
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,739
destruction of that sparse Delica

1934
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,320
connectivity that defines thingness and

1935
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,360
defines ensembles of things technically

1936
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,400
in terms of Markov blankets so if we

1937
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,440
want a world in which lots of different

1938
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,420
things can coexist in some kind of

1939
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,699
generalized synchrony in a sustainable

1940
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:24,540
way

1941
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,659
new deep sparse connectivity and the

1942
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:29,340
pathology the thing that will destroy

1943
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,920
that is over connectivity

1944
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,719
um so it seems to be very important that

1945
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:37,260
we get that into uh into play in terms

1946
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,659
of uh machine learning

1947
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:42,320
um artificial intelligence politics

1948
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,239
fintech climate change and the only way

1949
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:46,320
it's going to get there is is

1950
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,080
epistemically by uh equipping people to

1951
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,040
actually

1952
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,840
um build their own little models and ask

1953
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,280
their own questions you can't tell

1954
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,840
people this they're going to learn and

1955
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,980
they're going to learn it for themselves

1956
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,739
uh just very quickly because I'm sure

1957
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:00,060
yeah we've only got a couple of minutes

1958
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,300
left um the the the

1959
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,179
um the other agenda which I'm more

1960
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:08,580
familiar with is exactly Anderson and

1961
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,100
guillaume's agenda which is uh making

1962
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,699
this work in the context of uh

1963
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:17,699
um of Neurology and Psychiatry

1964
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:20,100
um so if you can democratize

1965
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,800
um and socialize this way of describing

1966
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,260
things so that people can now build

1967
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,360
models of their particular patient in

1968
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,060
the other use of precision Psychiatry

1969
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:33,000
um that are suspended games unit was

1970
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,620
called after

1971
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,960
um so to personalized medicine that is

1972
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,120
really personalized in the sense that it

1973
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,400
yo you actually have your digital twin

1974
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,219
of the of your behavior and then you've

1975
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,679
got that you know you optimize your

1976
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:50,699
digital twin to become a model of your

1977
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:53,040
patient and then you can start to do

1978
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,159
experiments on that on that model

1979
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:57,900
behavioral interventions or even share

1980
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,580
that model very much in the spirit of

1981
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,100
CBT with the patient and say look this

1982
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,540
is you this is what would happen if you

1983
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,040
went out and did this and this is what

1984
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,300
would happen if you went out and did

1985
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,380
that

1986
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,380
um you know that that to to my mind and

1987
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,179
indeed that was the initial motivation

1988
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:14,040
for much of this work was actually to

1989
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,360
build

1990
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,900
um observation models of psychiatric

1991
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,679
conditions to work out both the

1992
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:25,199
um the the pharmacological and

1993
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,540
physiological basis on the disruption of

1994
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,000
the overly the pathology of precision

1995
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,159
and message passing on the factor graphs

1996
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,540
that are our brain even though they are

1997
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:36,000
very empty and on the one hand but also

1998
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,580
get that behavior that that key thing

1999
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,080
that Anna was talking about the active

2000
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,140
engagement with the lived world uh into

2001
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,659
into that model and hence active

2002
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:48,960
inference and just to conclude you know

2003
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,020
um that that that activity that sort of

2004
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,179
physical engagement that embodiment that

2005
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:57,600
sort of um fouries and everything else

2006
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,159
um I think it's really coming to a head

2007
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:01,980
now in terms of people's um you know

2008
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,080
after the large language model after the

2009
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,380
chat GPT moment people the bounce back

2010
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,960
uh has been What's missing

2011
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,179
you know what's not there and of course

2012
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:14,820
what is not there is agency and embodied

2013
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,800
engagement with the world

2014
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,260
um and that's why I think Mr whole

2015
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:21,780
there's still a lot of work to be done

2016
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:24,239
you know in bringing artificial

2017
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,560
intelligence red as active inference to

2018
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,239
in a way that matters to people who you

2019
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,840
know your the people who can make a

2020
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,980
difference which is basically everybody

2021
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,500
but specifically politicians and doctors

2022
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,600
and the engineers and the like

2023
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,800
hmm

2024
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,739
so you all now have 30 seconds to 60

2025
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:46,020
seconds to speak directly to the

2026
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,140
audience what is the message that you

2027
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,179
what closing message do you have you're

2028
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:52,679
speaking directly to someone who's

2029
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:54,420
listening they're a curious person

2030
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,580
they're interested in active inference

2031
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,380
they also want to lead Better Lives

2032
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:01,679
hopefully and and and do something

2033
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:04,620
propitious so what message do you have

2034
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:06,780
for them

2035
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:10,460
Anna we'll start with you

2036
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,260
gosh

2037
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,719
um I'm just gonna say what pops into my

2038
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:18,960
mind right now is that one of the things

2039
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,699
I have learned from my patients who are

2040
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:22,560
trying to get into recovery from severe

2041
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,900
addictions is something that they call

2042
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,320
the set aside prayer where they set

2043
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,840
aside all of the Notions that they have

2044
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,600
about how the world works and try to be

2045
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,380
completely open and receptive to

2046
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:40,980
information coming into their minds and

2047
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:44,280
I think that's just a wonderful

2048
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,600
um

2049
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,679
a wonderful frame or concept for all of

2050
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,320
us uh living in the world to

2051
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,540
periodically just take a moment and take

2052
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,920
these models and just say you know

2053
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,300
everything I think I know about the

2054
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,639
world I'm going to temporarily suspend

2055
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:01,620
it and I'm just going to be open and

2056
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,960
when that happens we can be present and

2057
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,940
learn in a way that it's not possible

2058
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,620
when we're just trying to reinforce our

2059
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,420
models

2060
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,360
great fantastic and Bert and then we'll

2061
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,400
go Carl and then Rapha and then

2062
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,400
Guillaume

2063
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,980
um well I I just enjoyed today very much

2064
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:22,380
I thought there was a

2065
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,659
there was a little material boost for

2066
01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:26,280
people from let's say psychology

2067
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,340
Neuroscience but also from for engineers

2068
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,159
so if you haven't watched some of the

2069
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,260
talks go go look through the schedule

2070
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:35,820
because some of the talks were really

2071
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,820
good I think so I really enjoyed that

2072
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,500
um and then yeah what should I tell

2073
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,320
people um go work out do do a lot of

2074
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,710
sports it's good for you

2075
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,880
[Music]

2076
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,500
oh

2077
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,960
yeah sorry I was going to make a joke

2078
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,820
but I called because

2079
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,080
[Music]

2080
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,679
um so I'm going to use my 32nd uh just

2081
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:02,460
to thank uh Daniel and his team for for

2082
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,980
this um you know so if you want

2083
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,840
something to do

2084
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,639
um you should go and watch the live

2085
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,199
streams

2086
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:11,820
um and

2087
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,940
um get involved with this ecosystem I

2088
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,440
hadn't seen that paper be presented

2089
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,239
before but I was really impressed with

2090
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,040
you know with the sort of the active

2091
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,860
Institute and its openness and it's your

2092
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,360
welcoming

2093
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,080
um

2094
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,300
um attitude and vision like the

2095
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,860
Smithsonian

2096
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,800
um so if you want to pursue these ideas

2097
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,219
get involved and if you uh haven't got

2098
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:37,320
time just make sure you attend next

2099
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,600
year's active inference Institute a

2100
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,960
celebration but thank you Daniel

2101
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,520
Raphael

2102
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,400
yeah so I'll second what uh what Carl

2103
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,520
said and follow along with uh it's it's

2104
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,639
an invitation not just uh to participate

2105
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:55,739
in the in the active Advanced Institute

2106
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:58,620
but also an invitations participate in

2107
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:01,679
uh building this uh this Gaia tractor

2108
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,860
this uh this new way of of doing things

2109
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:08,400
that acknowledges the value of growth uh

2110
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,500
and also the value of sustainability

2111
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,179
joins it all together in this thing

2112
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:16,080
called regeneration and uh it really is

2113
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,420
uh it really is a collective effort it's

2114
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,420
a collective learning effort so

2115
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,520
um so and this also by the way also

2116
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,159
applies to to the the panelists as well

2117
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,860
and I think uh obviously what uh board

2118
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:32,880
and Carl are doing it has immediate uh

2119
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,560
things having that have to do with with

2120
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,560
uh what we're after but one of the main

2121
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,659
things that we discussed that we keep

2122
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:42,420
discussing is also like this uh the

2123
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,179
inter intersubjectivity and the The

2124
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,340
Importance of Being able to operate well

2125
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,199
as humans together and that connects

2126
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,540
directly to cognitive science Psychiatry

2127
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,540
uh and so

2128
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:57,239
and uh and yeah so everybody that wants

2129
01:29:57,239 --> 01:30:01,260
to to to be engaged and and be a part of

2130
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,460
building a better world should be

2131
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,860
thinking about how do I how what am I

2132
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,920
doing with my as an individual or as a

2133
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,100
as an employee organization or a

2134
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,860
researcher or as a leader uh or the

2135
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,020
family member what am I doing how does

2136
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:19,199
it contribute to to this uh this new

2137
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,780
this new non-steady non non equilibrium

2138
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,420
set of state so yeah that's that's kind

2139
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,920
of it I probably blew through the 60

2140
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,840
seconds but here it is

2141
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,000
and Guillaume

2142
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,239
well uh I would thanks also all of you

2143
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:35,880
for the discussion and the the organizer

2144
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,340
for what they are doing indeed like the

2145
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,199
the work of the actual Insurance

2146
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:43,500
Institute is very uh lovable and

2147
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,760
interesting from open science

2148
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,040
perspective they are really uh embodying

2149
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:51,840
that so big kudos to them and uh well uh

2150
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,940
where the fridge was saying like to do

sport is good for you I'm not very good

2152
01:30:56,219 --> 01:30:58,920
at sports but uh some say that science

2153
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,120
is a team sport so at least uh I have a

2154
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,120
good team perspective when doing science

2155
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,280
