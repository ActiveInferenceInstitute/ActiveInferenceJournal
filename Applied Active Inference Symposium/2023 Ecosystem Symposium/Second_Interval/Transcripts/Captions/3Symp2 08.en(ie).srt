6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,619
welcome Mahault this will be the final of

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,580
the

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,420
uh presentation sessions in the

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,679
symposium

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,620
this is Mal abrasan with the

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,140
presentation shared pretensions in

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,020
active inference so thank you Mao to you

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,760
and you're the first you're the first to

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,700
join with an AI Steward slash Guardian

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,660
awesome shall I share my screen yes

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,099
Let's do let's do let's do

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,860
a second I'm looking for a window

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,040
a thing this will do

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,260
okay so can you see the screen

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,540
Yep looks good thank you

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,560
awesome so unfortunately

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,900
I imagine

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,900
that you are seeing the entire screen

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,460
and not just the presentation I

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,320
apologize about that but I got it it's

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
it's cropped I got it okay wonderful

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,600
thank you

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,119
all right so

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,580
welcome to the presentation on shared

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,140
protection under active inference we're

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,380
going to cover a lot of topics

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,079
um shall I introduce myself a little bit

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,100
um

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,280
or have you already done that

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,659
awesome so my name is I'm a PhD student

36
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,240
in cognitive Computing I work in active

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,720
inference in the interaction between uh

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,380
social sciences uh philosophy

39
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,360
Consciousness science and artificial

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
intelligence

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,979
um we're going to start a presentation

42
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,320
on protection potential and active

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,699
inference so I'm going to define a lot

44
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,520
of terms it's going to deal into

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,620
um the last philosophy terms that are

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,180
very deep

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,700
um and uh so let's get started if you

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,160
will just give me one small second

49
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,459
and we're back

50
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,800
so shared retention is a term derived

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,020
from phenomenology and it refers to the

52
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,500
shared anticipation of future events

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,080
among a group of individuals this

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,940
philosophical study you've experienced

55
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,800
and Consciousness becomes particularly

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
interesting when we consider it in the

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,420
context of active inference

58
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,000
when we combine these two concepts we

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,860
get a powerful tool for understanding

60
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,680
how groups of individuals can coordinate

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,140
their actions and work towards a common

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,080
goal this is the main focus of the

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,420
discussion today so imagine

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,959
a group of people planning a trip

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,019
they all share a common goal to have a

66
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,959
successful and enjoyable trip

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
the shared goal forms the basis of their

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,500
shared protection they all anticipate

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,659
future events related to the trip such

70
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,640
as booking tickets packing their bags

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,400
and visiting various attractions

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
as they start to take actions towards

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,900
their goal they're also engaging in

74
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,879
active inference they're making

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,800
predictions about what will happen next

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,659
and then adjusting these predictions

77
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,120
based on what actually happens so for

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
example they might predict at a certain

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,659
flight will be the cheapest based on

80
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,060
their past experiences but when they

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,459
actually check the prices they find that

82
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,620
another flight is cheaper

83
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,019
so they adjust their prediction and book

84
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,580
the other flight

85
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,980
this constant cycle of prediction and

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,659
adjustment Guided by their shared

87
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,760
protection helps the group coordinate

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,319
their actions and make their trip to

89
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,060
success

90
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,040
so we're going to delve deeper into the

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,319
concepts and explore the role of past

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,840
experiences known as retentions in

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
shaping our current knowledge and future

94
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,180
predictions

95
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
explain let's explain first the concept

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,780
of retentions retention is a key

97
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,300
component of time Consciousness that

98
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,419
retains the past trajectory of a

99
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,400
temporal object

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,460
it's the preservation of the content of

101
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,120
a now past highlighted datum in our

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,100
present consciousness

103
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,139
a highletic datum refers to the raw

104
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,060
uninterpreted Sensations that arise in

105
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,979
our consciousness

106
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,860
when we retain these data

107
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,560
we are essentially keeping a record of

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,560
past Sensations and experiences that can

109
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
inform our present and our future

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,880
actions

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,100
inactive inference we can formalize

112
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,440
retention by thinking of moments as

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,740
binning of states which are bounds to a

114
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,300
hierarchical state

115
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,419
this way retention is seen as the

116
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,240
bidding which becomes the current state

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,240
informing the next expected state

118
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,340
to further connect retention with active

119
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,960
inference we can consider the way in

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
which retention plays a role in updating

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,840
an agent's belief and generative model

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,419
the past experiences influence the

123
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,300
current expectations and actions thus

124
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,979
shaping the agent's understanding of the

125
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,680
world and the future

126
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,320
so let's consider a practical example to

127
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,660
illustrate this concept if you had a

128
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,740
good experience at a particular

129
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,780
restaurant you might choose to go there

130
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,280
again in the future

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,500
your past experience influences your

132
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,620
future decision in hustling temporal

133
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,539
phenomenology we would think about much

134
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,400
shorter time scale but if we extend this

135
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,580
concept we can see a much larger

136
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,500
structure whereing the retention is

137
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,020
simply the past state

138
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,180
it's like having a mental node that says

139
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,639
this place is good and this is how an

140
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,380
example of retention works in your

141
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,000
everyday life

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,460
they're not merely representation or

143
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,820
memories but presentations of a

144
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,340
temporally extended present

145
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,960
which distinguishes them from

146
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,479
Recollections this involves the

147
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,940
presentation of some already constituted

148
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,300
content in conscious experience

149
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,220
retentions also play a crucial role in

150
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,080
mapping past knowledge onto current

151
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,479
beliefs contributing contributing to the

152
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,979
development of shared narratives or

153
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,440
goals that we will delve into in the

154
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
rest of the presentation

155
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
they can be former now points and the

156
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,340
current awareness of the past and far

157
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,919
sedimented retentions can be engraved in

158
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,160
scripts or deep temporal priors or more

159
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,460
fluid deonta cues

160
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,380
this phenomenon corresponds to a

161
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,960
specific application of message passing

162
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,780
between agents in the present moment and

163
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,960
in the sensorium

164
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,419
retentions and protentions may also

165
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,419
emerge jointly within a group

166
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,280
forming a collective understanding that

167
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,780
transcends individual perspectives

168
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,500
protentions as we saw

169
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
refer to the anticipation of future

170
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,380
events based on past experiences and

171
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,639
current knowledge

172
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,639
it's thus forward look it's the

173
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,440
forward-looking counterpart to retention

174
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,419
which is backward looking

175
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,880
protection is the anticipation of future

176
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,180
trajectories of a temporal object

177
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,340
it's the process of looking ahead

178
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,220
predicting what's to come based on what

179
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,099
has been and what currently is

180
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,660
so in active inference it could be

181
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,280
formalized by considering the future

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,620
states that are expected based on the

183
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,160
current state and past States

184
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,020
retention is thus the anticipation

185
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,758
guiding the next action

186
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,419
you can consider the way in which

187
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,639
protention plays a role in updating an

188
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
agent's beliefs and generative models

189
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,720
influencing the actions and thus shaping

190
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
the agent's understanding of the world

191
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,419
ends the future

192
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,520
so for instance if you see dark clouds

193
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,500
in the sky you might anticipate that

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,180
it's going to rain and decide to carry

195
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,820
an umbrella this anticipation of future

196
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,640
events is protention it's also going to

197
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,260
determine whether or not you're what

198
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,820
when you go outside and therefore

199
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,458
whether or not you expect to be wet

200
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,958
your brain is constantly making

201
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,339
predictions about what's going to happen

202
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,020
next

203
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,060
so let's put this in the context of

204
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,920
temporal flow

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,260
which ties together those concepts of

206
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,820
Primal Impressions and we will see

207
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,380
retention and retention

208
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,540
temporal flow is the structure that

209
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,839
represents the continuous progression of

210
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
time from the past through the present

211
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,080
and into the future

212
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,700
agents are constantly revising their

213
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,500
generative models and they do this by

214
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,839
integrating the observations which we

215
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,760
could refer to here as Primal

216
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
impressions

217
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,200
this updating process is a balancing act

218
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,519
between maintaining the predictive

219
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
density of the agent's current beliefs

220
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,760
and adapting to new information

221
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,320
retentions and protection structure a

222
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,420
time for a given agent creating a

223
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,060
framework that shapes their perception

224
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,220
and anticipation

225
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,519
different agents or systems will

226
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,740
exhibits

227
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,120
varying qualities and quantities of

228
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,000
retention and protection which resembles

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,100
something like Mike Levin's concept of

230
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,720
cognitive like

231
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,880
so given the presence of retention we

232
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,120
can anticipate a potential Horizon

233
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,120
not merely as an arbitrary expectation

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,260
students are thus the point at which

235
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,300
agents beliefs about the world are

236
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,160
updated to match their current

237
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,740
observations which leads to a more

238
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,940
accurate understanding of the

239
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,000
environment and allows for more

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,060
effective goal-directed Behavior

241
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,940
Primal impressions are the Fulfillment

242
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,640
of a protention which is the time-bound

243
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,660
Nexus of perception and existence

244
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,899
is it is resolved all right sorry it is

245
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,360
the result probability that redefines

246
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
the local radiant

247
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,680
it's in primary impression that reality

248
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
collapses

249
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,459
the Primal impression is thus mode

250
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,160
modeled as the essential Bayesian

251
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,200
cognitive moment

252
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,040
it is the juxtaposition of Prior beliefs

253
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,720
or retentions

254
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,120
with ongoing sensory information in an

255
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,160
unfolding future oriented present

256
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,680
retention

257
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,660
so now we have a description of temporal

258
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,360
thickness from the nominology which is

259
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
compatible with generative modeling and

260
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,100
active influence agents

261
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,500
for hustle this flow of conscious

262
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,420
experience is primarily made up of

263
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,600
Sensations that dwell up in a raw

264
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,320
uninterpreted form that we called

265
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
earlier highlighting data

266
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
so this data is the now phase of a

267
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,399
temporal object it is formatted

268
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,860
according to the eidetic or cognitive

269
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,779
laws of consciousness

270
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,940
this is specifically relative to Inner

271
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,180
time

272
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,339
you can understand how temporal Tempo

273
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,700
flow structures how agents are able to

274
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,220
make choices act to self-evidence

275
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,800
connect the passive structure with the

276
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
active component of decision making or

277
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,160
goal Pursuit

278
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,760
individuals have drives and teleology

279
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,440
insofar as they have preferences

280
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,620
these preferences are protented goals

281
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,079
reach towards by what we would call

282
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,060
potentially the Fiat

283
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,339
where in the Fiat constitute the willed

284
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,680
act towards a desire

285
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,980
so the Fulfillment of retention by Fiat

286
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,360
drives the agent towards the teleology

287
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,779
across a trail set

288
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,480
in a retentional extension

289
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,640
more information is a matter so the

290
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,560
longer your retention the more

291
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
information can be caught in a moment

292
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,079
as individuals amass enough information

293
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,079
they can then find a structure to the

294
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,240
information which becomes a map rather

295
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,700
than a territory it is computationally

296
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,440
more efficient than the sum of all the

297
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,079
information amongst

298
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,240
this new state of information may lead

299
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,120
individuals closer to a shared goal the

300
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
information a mass turns into an

301
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,440
emergent whole of the retention which

302
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,079
grabs focus at the present moment

303
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,360
because it seems to bring signals to the

304
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,120
model that the potential role is closer

305
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,339
and is computationally simpler to retain

306
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,459
so sharing of retentions and protections

307
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,100
among group members any social context

308
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,160
can facilitate coordination and the

309
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
achievement of a shared goal

310
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
by aligning their beliefs about the past

311
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
or retentions and expectations about the

312
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,339
future or pretensions group members can

313
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,920
better predict each other's actions and

314
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,480
intentions

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,540
this allows them to work together more

316
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,019
effectively

317
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,579
in some cases group members may have

318
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,320
retentions and protentions that align

319
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,139
naturally due to Common experiences or

320
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,260
understanding even without active

321
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,760
communication

322
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
however group members often actively

323
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,260
communicate their retentions and

324
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,260
protentions aligning their beliefs and

325
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,899
expectations through dialogue and

326
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,339
interaction

327
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,100
thereby

328
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,480
enhancing their ability to predict each

329
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,300
other's actions and intentions

330
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,180
retentions and protections may also

331
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,639
emerge jointly within the group not

332
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,040
confined to any individual agents umwelt

333
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,560
forming a collective understanding that

334
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,700
transcends individual perspectives

335
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,860
this complex interplay of individual and

336
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,839
Collective Dynamics can be explored

337
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,240
further in hierarchical genetic models

338
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,540
encompassing resonant cognitive models

339
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,939
communication and even joint emergence

340
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,579
the structure of time Consciousness

341
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,620
encapsulated in retention and protection

342
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,800
thus plays a significant role in the

343
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,399
emergence of shared potentials

344
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,100
as agents retain and process similar

345
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,139
elements from their environment they can

346
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,380
co-compute share protections by mapping

347
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,540
each other's cognitive Pathways and

348
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,959
building upon one another's trails

349
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,420
this process is formalized by Bayesian

350
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,740
updating

351
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,579
um

352
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,620
the relationship between the topology of

353
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,440
protensions and the expectation gradient

354
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,300
as well as the role of retention in

355
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,339
mapping past knowledge on the current

356
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,620
beliefs plays a role in development of

357
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,420
shared narratives and goals

358
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,639
we can use this to get a deeper insight

359
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,620
into the processes that drive the

360
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,540
emergence of collective Behavior and the

361
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,860
development of shared understanding

362
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,699
among agents

363
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,360
there's no better way to do it than

364
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,699
using active inference by extending

365
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,560
generative models of individual agents

366
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,380
to account for the beliefs and goals of

367
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,000
other agents

368
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
this is the kin2 theory of mind it

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,040
enables them to anticipate and adapt to

370
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,260
the actions of their peers by offloading

371
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,740
to the group

372
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,820
so

373
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,459
we discussed a little bit earlier shared

374
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,720
goals

375
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,779
potential goals are future oriented

376
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,000
objectives that individuals or groups

377
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,620
strive to achieve

378
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,380
they're not just mere desires but

379
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,300
they're actively pursued through the act

380
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,639
of will that we called earlier Fiat

381
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,399
the Fulfillment of a pretension drives

382
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,139
the agent towards the teleology that

383
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,560
trail set we discussed

384
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,500
of a prediction entails less surprises

385
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,779
and therefore the agent's self-evidences

386
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,180
by seeking to accurately predict their

387
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,380
surroundings

388
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,720
agents like the series of actions or

389
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,880
policies which generate transitions

390
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,620
between states that produce expected

391
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,720
observations so through the choice of

392
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,060
policy an individual can reach their

393
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,220
protented goal by minimizing the

394
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,019
expected free energy that a given policy

395
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,420
affords them this seems pretty Central

396
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,000
and simple in terms of active inference

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,459
so farther protections are represented

398
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,579
by the policies of longer time depth

399
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,620
in a hierarchical model this corresponds

400
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,180
to a policy tied to a higher level

401
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,759
action in a slower time scale

402
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
the choice of policies driven by the

403
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,779
expected free energy of that higher

404
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,019
order policy or the entire multi-scale

405
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,660
generative model is based on the agent's

406
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,939
preferences allowing an agent to conduct

407
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,819
gold directed behaviors across temporal

408
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,240
scales

409
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,099
so this is where we can cash out

410
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,079
um Jeff yoshimi's Trail sets where

411
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,240
agents assimilate actions into the

412
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
anticipated continuity of objects in

413
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,140
their surrounding world

414
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,020
this is simulation

415
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,579
ensures a smoother understanding of the

416
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,439
environment and helps agents adapt

417
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,340
effectively near protensions act as the

418
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,799
near present contextual proximity and

419
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,660
the far pretensions rely on passive

420
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,179
synthesis of deontic cues which are

421
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,980
sedimented retentions in the environment

422
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,840
the preferences of the agents aligned by

423
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,360
policies correspond to attracting sets

424
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,059
which in the socio-cognitive setting can

425
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,059
be instantiated as narratives having

426
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,760
shared narrative is a necessary aspect

427
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,860
of any exchange between artifacts people

428
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,140
institutions that have some kind of

429
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,860
attracting set

430
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,360
generalized synchrony which we will

431
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,299
discuss a little bit later as well

432
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,880
so a team working on a project has a

433
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,620
potential goal to complete the project

434
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,840
successfully

435
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,400
the shared narrative might be the

436
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,620
project plan that guides their actions

437
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,120
it's like everyone in the team has a

438
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,799
shared story about what they're trying

439
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,660
to achieve and how they're going to do

440
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,780
it

441
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,520
the relationship between current states

442
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
and future observations is captured

443
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,740
within the B Matrix transitions

444
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,960
this Matrix represents the probability

445
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,720
of transitioning to a new state based on

446
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,700
the current state so the B Matrix

447
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,500
transition

448
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,360
and the a matrix is utilized to

449
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,919
determine which new observations is most

450
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,419
likely to occur given the current state

451
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,940
and potential transitions

452
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,280
in the Assyrian framework the

453
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,260
expectation gradient structure plays a

454
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,080
crucial role in defining the depth and

455
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,020
fulfillment of pretensions

456
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,360
the structure represents the varying

457
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,900
degrees of certainty and confidence

458
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,160
agents have in their predictions about

459
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,780
future States

460
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,140
the topology thus is inter and the

461
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,059
arrangements is interrelation I'm sorry

462
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,880
or there is an interrelation between the

463
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
protentions or the arrangements of

464
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,600
future expectations which is

465
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,299
proportional to the expectation gradient

466
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,919
the higher the gradient the more

467
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,360
detailed and accurate the pretensions

468
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,139
are likely to be

469
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,280
the potential Horizon represents the

470
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,460
static states of the expected futures of

471
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,780
the temporal object while the

472
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,299
continuation Horizon is The Amalgamated

473
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,260
Trail of the temporal object

474
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,480
potential and continuation Horizons are

475
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,179
carried in protentions while the

476
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,980
imminent Horizon consists of the Primal

477
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,580
impressions

478
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,400
so agents can coordinate through

479
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,160
co-construction where agents or

480
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,740
individuals interact and collaborate to

481
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,419
build this shared understanding and

482
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,919
shared goals

483
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,580
this process is deeply interconnected

484
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,200
within a complex web where agents

485
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,539
typically coexist with other agents or

486
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,760
subjects

487
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,280
forming the collective often referred to

488
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,100
as multi-aged groups swarm ensembles or

489
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,840
assemblage

490
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,940
by aligning their beliefs to the signal

491
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,799
found within their Niche they can better

492
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,720
adapt to the environment and develop a

493
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,039
shared understanding of their

494
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,460
surroundings

495
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,020
sharing information with other agents is

496
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,640
beneficial as it allows them to trust

497
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,160
one another and pull their resources

498
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,500
this collaborative approach is

499
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,299
preferable to a conflict-driven scenario

500
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,160
in which every other agent is perceived

501
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,840
as a potential source of risk and

502
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,100
surprising

503
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,320
by sharing information agents could

504
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,059
collectively construct a more accurate

505
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,500
representation of their environment

506
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,120
leading to more effective

507
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,460
decision-making in action

508
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,559
through these interactions shared

509
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,360
narratives and goals can emerge from a

510
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,520
co-construction of the world and each

511
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,620
agent's generated model

512
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,539
so these narratives and roles are the

513
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,059
result of dynamic process that in fact

514
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,160
can be mathematically modeled through

515
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,320
the equations that we introduce in the

516
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
paper that is that this presentation is

517
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,500
based on but that I will present a

518
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,240
little bit later

519
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,039
they capture the process of mutual

520
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,080
learning where agents adapt their

521
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,220
generative model based on the

522
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,900
information gathered from their

523
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,480
interactions with others

524
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,640
agents may start off with slightly or

525
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,460
greatly diverging generative model so in

526
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,620
order to minimize surprise there will be

527
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,600
a natural alignment within a group as

528
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,940
agents adapt to the evolving dynamics of

529
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,640
their environment and social contexts

530
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,280
for example again consider this team

531
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,840
working on the project

532
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,460
even if you have your own understanding

533
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,740
of the model or of the project you'll

534
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,600
interact and share information and learn

535
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,539
from each other and then adapt the model

536
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,980
over time you'll develop a shared

537
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,720
understanding of the project and a

538
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,419
shared goal for its completion

539
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,120
this is an instance of co-construction

540
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,440
it's like building a house together

541
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,299
where everyone contributes to the final

542
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,340
structure

543
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,620
the emergence of shared narratives and

544
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,480
the learning and recognition of them may

545
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
be made more efficient through certain

546
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,460
mechanisms such as language

547
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,940
in an experiment Illustrated uh in a

548
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,620
paper that

549
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,080
um Carl was on

550
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,000
um two agents share the same sensorium

551
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,559
ask each other's questions I think it's

552
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,260
a paper on 20 questions and Emma homes

553
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,059
um with a shared narrative entailing a

554
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,620
Common Language

555
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,360
this illustrates the market efficiency

556
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,559
and the minimization of free energy

557
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,659
simply by having a shared language a

558
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,200
common ground

559
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,059
so shared protections are common future

560
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,000
anticipations or goals that emerge among

561
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,080
groups of individuals through

562
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
co-construction

563
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,500
it allows them to better anticipate each

564
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,360
other's actions and intentions and work

565
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,400
towards a common goal

566
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,799
it's strongly tied to the conscious

567
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,840
efforts of individuals to work towards

568
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,100
that goal

569
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,320
and to effectively create an

570
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,179
organizational structures where we're

571
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,140
engaged in a conversation in an exchange

572
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,059
assuming that this exchange is meant to

573
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,820
align our generative models

574
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,260
so think of for instance the football

575
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
team

576
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,260
again they have a shared pretension to

577
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,940
win the match they anticipate each

578
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,500
other's moves and adapt their strategies

579
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,080
based on the ongoing game everyone in

580
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,700
the team has a shared vision of Victory

581
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,380
and they're constantly adjusting their

582
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,520
actions to make it happen

583
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,740
so individuals infer each other's mental

584
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,900
states by observing cues which they can

585
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,940
attribute to hidden causes they use

586
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,760
their own model of or models that they

587
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,860
have learned to recognize about others

588
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,600
this process is known as generalized

589
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,340
synchrony entailing Mutual

590
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,620
predictability and can be interpreted as

591
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,239
a collective minimization of free energy

592
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
in a group setting individuals create

593
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,240
cues in the world that direct other

594
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,100
agents attentions towards the same

595
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,200
signals their models of the world

596
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,299
aligned by sharing similar goals and

597
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,460
similar environments and by reinforcing

598
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,700
patterns of sampling reality

599
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,220
so we could we could try to represent

600
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,500
this through polynomials

601
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,080
um and morphisms each agent's

602
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,220
interaction with the environment

603
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,020
corresponds to amorphism and the

604
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,640
collective interaction of all agents can

605
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
be represented as a polynomial

606
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,780
so

607
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,360
amorphism sort of if a polynomial p is

608
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,460
defined uh morphism between two

609
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,559
polynomials p and Q consists of a pair

610
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,400
of functions f and g such that F Maps P

611
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,980
of 1 to Q of one

612
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,039
and G Maps P of I to Q of the quantity

613
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,320
one this morphism must satisfy the

614
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,000
commutative the requirements meaning

615
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,240
that the following diagram commutes

616
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,440
um

617
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,679
tier one p ofi maps to Q the quantity I

618
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,740
and tier one maps to Q of one

619
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,539
so we can see how we could create a

620
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,179
framework to further explore the

621
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,620
cooperative and competitive Dynamics

622
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,679
among agents for multiple agents indexed

623
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,780
by I with boundaries p and share

624
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,179
environment boundary Q their interaction

625
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,039
can represent can be represented by a

626
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,679
morphism of polynomials which allows us

627
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,480
to understand the shared protection in

628
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,100
multi-agent systems and provide the

629
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,780
foundation for further exploration of

630
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,039
Cooperative Dynamics

631
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,200
we allow each agent to predict not only

632
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,059
its own behavior but also the behavior

633
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,980
of its Companions and the environment's

634
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,240
response to their actions

635
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,440
so the Dynamics of shared credentials

636
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
are really useful here and can be

637
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,379
properly cached out mathematically

638
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,559
so recursive cognition and prediction on

639
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,720
the shared environment of the agent's

640
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,279
actions and response to each other's

641
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
actions

642
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,720
we can use sheep theoretic and topless

643
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,799
theoretic approaches to understand

644
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,380
multi-agent systems a multi-agent system

645
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,299
is a system where multiple individuals

646
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,520
or entities interact so for example a

647
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,080
traffic system can be considered a

648
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
multi-agent system or different vehicles

649
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,919
or interact

650
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,140
the topos is a category that has both

651
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,480
spatial and logical structure allowing

652
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,799
for the expression of logical

653
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,320
propositions and deductions within it so

654
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,820
we can use these approaches to construct

655
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,679
a coherent understanding of the world

656
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,440
from the perspective of multiple agents

657
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
the internal Universe of Agents which

658
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
can be seen as mathematical objects

659
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
containing beliefs perceptions and

660
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
predictions of individual agents are

661
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,020
represented using topoi

662
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,900
these internal universes provide a

663
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,520
foundation for understanding and

664
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,140
representing the complex interactions

665
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,700
and shared understanding among multiple

666
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,360
agents in this Dynamic environment

667
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,179
we try to construct a consensus topos by

668
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,159
patching together the internal universes

669
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,520
or topoi of multiple agents and the idea

670
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,440
is to use the chief theoretic and topos

671
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,940
theoretic structures to build a shared

672
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,480
understanding

673
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,580
so we can thus derive the

674
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,320
synchronization of goal oriented actions

675
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,179
among agents over time and leverage

676
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,740
mathematical insights for category

677
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,980
Theory and generalities generated models

678
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,620
this connection is the mechanism through

679
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,080
which the group synchronizes over time

680
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,600
and ultimately achieves their objective

681
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
agents within the system might possess

682
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,799
very levels of certainty in achieving

683
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,080
the objective some may choose to expand

684
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,360
less energy temporarily decelerating

685
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,980
their progress towards the desired

686
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,320
outcome this variation in certainty and

687
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,820
approach leads to the emergence of

688
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,220
different roles within a group with some

689
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,080
agents focusing on computational tasks

690
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,059
while other monitor outcomes are engaged

691
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,100
in different actions in themselves

692
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,260
the nested and distributed structure of

693
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,760
generative models in active inference

694
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,140
allows for the integration of both

695
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,440
short-term and long-term goals agents

696
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,179
with similar or compatible preferences

697
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,460
can coordinate their actions by aligning

698
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,200
their policies and working towards

699
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,940
common narratives

700
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,740
so this alignment reduces the overall

701
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,539
expected free energy of their joint

702
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,220
actions increasing the likelihood of

703
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,260
achieving shared goals and facilitating

704
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,760
and sharing of goals and expectations

705
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,720
among group members

706
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,820
they can learn which allows them to

707
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,159
learn essential role in shaping agents

708
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,640
preferences and strategies over time

709
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,020
agents can gather new experiences and

710
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,520
update their generative model they

711
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,260
refine their preferences and methods for

712
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,140
achieving goals they can influence the

713
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,700
formation and modification of shared

714
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,200
narratives by having different

715
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,059
perspective over different parts of a

716
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,919
goal

717
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,179
here

718
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,919
the the concept of General Life

719
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,779
synchrony is manifested when all agents

720
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,760
have learned compatible or harmonized

721
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,740
aspects of the overall generative model

722
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,720
the synchronization is rooted in the

723
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,460
retentional and potential dynamics of

724
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,080
agents and can be more accurately

725
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,820
described using mathematical models

726
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,700
so in conclusion

727
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,620
we tried to shed light on the concept of

728
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,480
shared potential goals and multi-agent

729
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,700
systems we've emphasized the importance

730
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,200
of understanding this concept as it

731
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,820
plays a crucial role in the coordination

732
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,740
synchronization of Agents actions and

733
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,860
intentions

734
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,720
in the future continuously highlight the

735
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,880
role of cues in the environment and how

736
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,559
they can be simple like marks on the

737
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,360
road or more complex like symbols and

738
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,440
language

739
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
the queues become carriers of passive

740
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,039
synthesis fire protections and far

741
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,140
retention and become wasted minus free

742
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,700
energy as they minimize the amount of

743
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,159
any individual has to compute

744
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,200
it also allows us to delve into the

745
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,419
concept of other evidencing in which the

746
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,520
environment is in effect the self and

747
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,899
others must learn to navigate in terms

748
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,159
navigate in terms of others and self

749
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,679
we've provided mathematical models to an

750
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,480
equation standalized dynamics of shared

751
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,159
protections more accurately in terms of

752
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,080
category Theory

753
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,120
we've explored the Dynamics of shared

754
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,620
retentions and retention in higher

755
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,419
Google generative models which reflect

756
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,039
the complex interplay of individuals and

757
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,899
Collective Dynamics

758
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,240
we've encapsulated the structure of time

759
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,640
Consciousness and how that this allows

760
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,440
agents to co-compute Shared protections

761
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,820
by mapping each other's cognitive

762
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,360
pathways

763
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,460
so our approach basically begins an

764
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,980
examination of Hospital temporal

765
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,960
phenomenology integrated with the

766
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,299
hierarchical active inference model

767
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:17,100
polynomial morphisms and home

768
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,559
polynomials this enables recursive

769
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,539
cognition and prediction of not only an

770
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,159
agent's actions but also the

771
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,460
environment's response to these actions

772
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,740
so I think this comes to the end Daniel

773
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,320
I think I'm literally at 30 minutes

774
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,299
thank you

775
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,279
impeccable thank you Mahault

776
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,460
yeah great uh presentation awesome topic

777
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,360
so

778
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,860
thank you for joining and looking

779
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,659
forward to seeing how the work continues

780
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,140
to develop

781
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,340
all right

782
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,659
farewell Mahault, see you
