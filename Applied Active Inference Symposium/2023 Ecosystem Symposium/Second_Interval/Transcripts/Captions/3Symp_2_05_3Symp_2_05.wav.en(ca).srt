1
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,976
Welcome. Raf, also co author on the

2
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:23,370
paper. So how are you doing?

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,200
I'm good. What about you? Pretty good.

4
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,344
Other than this brief interval of white

5
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:32,170
light, I'm just hanging out.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,384
Fantastic. So I'm trying to figure out

7
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:40,850
here how I can. I'm using a different

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,904
slide software, so I need to make sure

9
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:45,824
that I can pull this up in the right

10
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:47,520
way. So give me just a quick second.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,910
Yeah, great. Cool. So just just to

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,532
read off what's coming while you figure

13
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:57,044
that out.

14
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:00,564
So right now we have Ralph Kaufman, and

15
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,720
this presentation is going to be Gaia,

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,044
an active powered network for planetary

17
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:08,024
scale sense making. Following this 30

18
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,716
minutes presentation, we'll have Avel

19
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:12,308
Gwynen Carlo on embedded Normativity.

20
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,810
That looks perfect. That's perfect.

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,116
Awesome. All right. Thanks, Raph, to

22
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:22,188
you. Thank you. All right, I was going

23
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,156
to try to see if I could blow this up to

24
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:25,310
full screen, but.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,860
I got it on the stream.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,290
Looks good on the stream. Go for it.

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,244
Cool. So I'm just pulling up my notes

28
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:39,696
here. All right, so let

29
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:43,508
me just test that this moves. Did I

30
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:44,660
just move the slide?

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,068
Great. Cool. All right, so as I said,

32
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:52,404
hi, everyone. It's a huge pleasure to be

33
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,468
here and thank you so much to Daniel and

34
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:55,764
everybody else in the Institute for

35
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:58,072
organizing this. I'm going to talk about

36
00:01:58,126 --> 00:01:59,704
what I think is the single most

37
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:01,076
important application of active

38
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:03,736
entrance. Not as a detriment to the

39
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,816
others, but it's sort of upstream of

40
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,564
everything else. And that is how do the

41
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,876
8 billion of us humans make sense of

42
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,716
what's going on in our planet and all

43
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:15,084
scales? And how do we use that

44
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,740
understanding to survive as a species?

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,096
So this presentation here is a bit of a

46
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:24,768
technical presentation and it has a lot

47
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:26,784
of content. It's going to move pretty

48
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,236
fast and assume that you're familiar

49
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,784
with some concepts, but I'm going to try

50
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,680
to leave time for Q A at the end. So

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,996
first of all, I'm going to talk about

52
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,964
the motivation behind what we're doing,

53
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:38,768
in particular the concepts of the meta

54
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,124
crisis and the third attractor. Then

55
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,024
I'll give an overview of our network

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,980
architecture and the application so far

57
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,952
and cover the many remaining challenges.

58
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:50,056
And last but not least, I plan to

59
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,384
convince you that this is the single

60
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,856
most important thing you could ever be

61
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,936
working on. And I'm doing this because

62
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,848
we need your help. So that's a taster of

63
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:01,212
what we have. As I said,

64
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,196
let's jump right into it with the

65
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:06,264
motivation. And what greater motivation

66
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,668
could there be? If you haven't heard of

67
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:11,756
the metacrisis, it's a term that it's

68
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:14,048
originally from Doctor Who, but it was

69
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:16,764
borrowed by thinker called Daniel

70
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,072
Schmuckenberger to talk about the total

71
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,236
risk for humanity and the biosphere that

72
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,924
is posed by the combination of three

73
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:27,072
factors. The first being the increasing

74
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:29,572
interconnectedness of everything from

75
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,112
climate to food security to national

76
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:34,072
security. To biodiversity and everything

77
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:37,684
in between. The second being the risks

78
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,156
associated with self evolving

79
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:41,476
technology, including runaway artificial

80
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:43,944
intelligence and the third being the

81
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,208
increasing omnipresence of coordination

82
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:50,508
failures personified as the god of

83
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:53,308
coordination failures moloch. And so the

84
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,212
combination of these three factors as

85
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,724
hypothesized by Schmuckenberger will

86
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:00,876
lead to either one of two attractors,

87
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:03,840
one of them being chaotic breakdown of

88
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,368
all structure and the second being a

89
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,652
reversal to oppressive authoritarian

90
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,872
control. And obviously both of those

91
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:14,276
qualify as that in my book, I assume in

92
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:17,300
yours as well. So the question of course

93
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,252
is can we actually find a third

94
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:22,196
attractor that is positive sum as

95
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,496
opposed to negative sum? And rather the

96
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:28,744
question is can we design it? So what I

97
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:31,684
claim, and what we as the Guy Consortium

98
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:35,064
claim, is that yes we can and we can

99
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:38,572
design this attractor. The design

100
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,640
goal is basically to build resilience

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,896
and stabilization into our biosocial

102
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:48,344
economic system and to do this subject

103
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,636
to multilevel system constraints like

104
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,416
the planetary boundaries desirability,

105
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,976
meaning it has to be something that

106
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:56,624
people actually want so they will help

107
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,908
it happen. So it needs to preserve

108
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,496
standards of living and so on. And it

109
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:01,788
needs to be feasible, it needs to be

110
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:03,664
achievable from our current initial

111
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,068
conditions. And of course there's a lot

112
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,836
of design complicators in the mix, some

113
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,668
of which partial observation, there's a

114
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:13,840
lot of information asymmetry going on,

115
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,872
there's a lot of uncertainty about how

116
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,816
the pieces of the world system work from

117
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,684
a scientific perspective, there's

118
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,476
obvious computability constraints

119
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:26,444
associated to this. And last but not

120
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:29,004
least, you can't really control what

121
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,780
happens. In most cases we can only

122
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,796
create incentives, recommendations and

123
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:36,812
nudges. So easy,

124
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,856
right? Of course it's not easy, but we

125
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:44,124
think we can do it if we apply the sum

126
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,368
of the principles from cybernetics that

127
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:48,016
we already know and apply them in a

128
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,924
decentralized positive sum composable

129
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:54,548
way. So what we're talking about here is

130
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,624
decentralized network, a decentralized

131
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,424
hybrid AI human network for planetary

132
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,620
scale decision support and automation.

133
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,520
It recognizes that we will have human

134
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,856
and artificial agents interacting by the

135
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:12,824
billions in an open network. Its goal is

136
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,880
to facilitate both continuance or model

137
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,048
alignment and coherence or goal

138
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,552
alignment at multiple levels or scales

139
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:22,396
up to the global scale, meaning the

140
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:25,372
survival of the system as a whole. It

141
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:28,184
will need to feature built in incentives

142
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:30,912
and governance and it will need to be

143
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:33,810
privacy preserving, intrinsically. So

144
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,912
the below listed participants are

145
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,896
participants, founders of the

146
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:40,336
consortium. I'm going to talk about it

147
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,776
later. So this is the framing,

148
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,088
this is the motivation for what we're

149
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,628
doing. And now I'm going to give a

150
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:51,364
whirlwind tour of the architecture so

151
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:54,324
far and I'm going to cover mostly what

152
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,836
we've built, the version of this

153
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,872
architecture that we've built so far,

154
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:01,256
thinking about this explicitly. And then

155
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:02,376
I'm going to talk about how this

156
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:03,944
connects to other architectures that

157
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,464
already exist in the world, just very

158
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:09,196
briefly. So we've been framing this

159
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:12,540
as an architecture for building

160
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,660
decentralized digital twins, which are

161
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,252
local models of real world systems that

162
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,484
run in network. And the role

163
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,728
that such digital twins play is that

164
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,216
they help us understand the costs and

165
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,136
benefits of strategies and projects that

166
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:30,656
happen in the real world. And in

167
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:32,532
our organization, Digital Gaia, we

168
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,420
started out caring primarily about

169
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,204
agroecology. So how do you actually make

170
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:39,572
better decisions, meaning better

171
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,200
recommendations, negotiations,

172
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,272
valuations, investments into a farm,

173
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:48,560
into a forest, into bio

174
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,376
landscape, to make it better, to make it

175
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,840
more likely to survive and thrive.

176
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,624
So, as practical implementation,

177
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:02,252
it needs to tackle several real world

178
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:05,212
challenges. First of all, it needs to

179
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:08,190
handle distributed, non IID data.

180
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,308
Data is sparse. It's heterogeneous,

181
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:12,972
it's private, it's potentially

182
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:16,524
unreliable. It needs to enable localized

183
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,476
collaborative forecasting and planning,

184
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,604
personalized planning and privacy

185
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:24,096
preserving. It needs to accept

186
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,444
the fact that it won't be able to

187
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,824
directly control, but only recommended

188
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:32,052
nudge, as we discussed. And the

189
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,016
outline of what we came up with is this

190
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,976
concept of the Guy Network, which is a

191
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,516
mesh of AI agents called natural

192
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:41,416
entities, or Ants for short, that act as

193
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,400
proxies for real world systems. Each ant

194
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,492
runs on an engine called Tengor, which

195
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,196
it uses to inquire, learn, plan, and

196
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:54,344
allocate resources. And ants communicate

197
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:56,220
in a language called the Guy Protocol.

198
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,304
They use this language to independently

199
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,684
interact with their environments and

200
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:03,836
each other. And if we do this right I'll

201
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,408
show a bit more of this later, but if we

202
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,036
do this right, the Guy network's

203
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,116
behavior approximates a single composite

204
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:13,216
agent that handles, that interacts

205
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,136
with and couples with its global

206
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:19,796
environment. Cool. So just

207
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:22,004
to give you an overview of how this

208
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:25,060
works under the hood, the Fangor engine

209
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,412
is really the heart of our architecture.

210
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:30,296
And the core loop that is mentioned here

211
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,392
is a typical active inference loop. But

212
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,356
to make this work in very heterogeneous

213
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,056
and distributed context, there's lots of

214
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,996
work involved. So just some highlights

215
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:39,836
that I think are going to be

216
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:41,740
particularly interesting for this crowd.

217
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,004
First of all, so as I said, the same

218
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,084
core engine needs to be able to work for

219
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,472
very heterogeneous contexts. So each

220
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:51,344
agent has access to a library of

221
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,904
generative models. And these models are

222
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,730
specified using a Python based

223
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,944
probabilistic programming DSL, and they

224
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,556
declare what context they're appropriate

225
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:03,204
for using a shared ontology. Using that

226
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,908
ontology, Fangorn can then select the

227
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,508
most appropriate model to use online,

228
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,412
given the configurations, like project

229
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,044
configurations and the kinds of

230
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:14,644
observational data available. So using

231
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:18,176
a model that's appropriate for farm

232
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,976
or for forest, what kind of farm, what

233
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,684
kind of forest, what kind of ecosystem,

234
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:25,512
what kind of their context energy

235
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:29,388
project I'm going to get into the

236
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,116
examples right now because there's more

237
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:34,796
on the applications later on. So we end

238
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,112
up with a network of heterogeneous

239
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:39,232
agents, but that's okay. They actually

240
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:42,784
form a single model in a formal sense

241
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,140
because they're all connected

242
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,936
hierarchically by a system of

243
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:51,248
hyperparators. And this means that

244
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,964
Fangor needs to support inference of

245
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,248
generic hierarchical generative models.

246
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,136
And we actually do this automatically

247
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:58,884
using approximate posteriors with

248
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:00,340
structural constraints.

249
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,324
And so we have this global model that

250
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,984
connects all the nodes and describes

251
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,404
general facts that apply over multiple

252
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,104
contexts. And this means the whole

253
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:11,736
network needs to jointly perform

254
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,856
inference over this global model using a

255
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:17,592
peer to peer or federated algorithm. So

256
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,196
initially the way this works is

257
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,816
initially the network sets the global

258
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,736
posterior to be the same as the global

259
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,072
prior. Each node then independently

260
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,756
performs local optimization of the

261
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:30,024
variational free energy and then passes

262
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,916
the parameters of the new global

263
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,332
solution to the peers in the network

264
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:36,336
where they use it as a hyperprior. And

265
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,592
this works over a broad range of

266
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,304
topologies and under pretty general

267
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:42,896
constraints. And by the way, I'd like to

268
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,516
mention that there's a lot of overlap

269
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:47,476
and interaction between the stuff that

270
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,028
I'm talking about here and some of the

271
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,372
other presentations that you're seeing

272
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,344
today and I wasn't able to reference

273
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,808
them explicitly in this talk, but I'm

274
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,720
sure you're going to see the connections

275
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,184
cool. So what it turns out is

276
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,136
that the shared parameters that

277
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,784
represent our global model are

278
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:07,864
effectively stored by the network stored

279
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,696
in a federated parameter store, meaning

280
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:13,180
that each node stores their own local

281
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,696
parameters, they're private stuffed

282
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:16,732
about their own local context and

283
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,848
multiple nodes store copies of the

284
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:22,512
global parameters. And this

285
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,492
architecture, because it supports

286
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,944
heterogeneous local models, it actually

287
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,928
allows us to introduce another kind of

288
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,952
nodes which we call ant mood nodes.

289
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,544
These are nodes that aggregate

290
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,260
scientific and empirical information

291
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,924
using a meta analysis model. And we

292
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:40,368
actually are able to use that meta

293
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,780
analysis model to constrain our project

294
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,804
level models or ants using quote unquote

295
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:48,596
imported knowledge that wasn't directly

296
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,504
observed by them, which is left to right

297
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,504
in this picture. But this actually also

298
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,724
goes two ways. So empirical findings

299
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:57,016
from the project, what actually works on

300
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,620
the ground for this particular project

301
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,016
also informs the ant modes posteriors

302
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,356
which is the right to left. And so we

303
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:06,140
actually have a complete cycle of

304
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,436
science and empirics all implemented

305
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,720
using hierarchical active inference.

306
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,268
So finally, just among the global

307
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,096
parameters that network learns by

308
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,012
federated inference are the precisions

309
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:22,096
associated with data coming from the

310
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,788
different data providers. And this gives

311
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:27,252
each node a way to consume data without

312
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,236
trusted ground truth and basically to

313
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:30,596
learn together which sources they can

314
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:34,276
rely on it for what? This is just some

315
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:36,736
of more core features. We're working on

316
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,344
integrating many other capabilities into

317
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,024
this architecture. Not going to go

318
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:43,624
through all of this, but basically what

319
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:44,808
we're finding is that we have all the

320
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,556
building blocks to turn this into a full

321
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:48,556
feature decision network complete with

322
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,696
its own internal knowledge economy,

323
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:54,460
meaning that contributions get

324
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,644
attributed and rewarded in proportion to

325
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,064
the free energy reduction that they

326
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:03,120
afford. Cool.

327
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,176
So, jumping into applications, as I

328
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,328
mentioned, our main focus as an

329
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,596
organization has been on modeling

330
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,104
agroecological projects like

331
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:14,380
regenerative agriculture and

332
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,868
agroforestry. And this exercises all the

333
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:18,084
constraints that we've talked about so

334
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,916
far. So again, I'm not going to go into

335
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,164
full detail, but just to give an

336
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,204
overview of what is the anatomy of

337
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:27,556
generative model for a farm or forest.

338
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,304
So start at the bottom right with

339
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,984
observables that are things that we can

340
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:33,800
measure about that ecosystem, about that

341
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,696
local context like the plant count and

342
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,884
size, vegetation indices from satellite

343
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:42,596
data and so on. These are linked

344
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,596
to latent states which form a nonlinear

345
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:47,144
dynamical system that's parameterized by

346
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,544
the policy the the things that

347
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:53,664
modulate the latent states like

348
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,536
agricultural interventions and

349
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,788
practices. You can think of the timing

350
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:00,028
of planting and harvesting, what kinds

351
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,924
of crops or trees get planted, what

352
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:03,876
products like pesticides get applied or

353
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:07,136
not, and more as well as covariates.

354
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,784
So external events like weather,

355
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:11,284
physical risks, wildfire, drought and so

356
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:15,588
on. And so there's some scientific

357
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:19,624
and measurement parameters that

358
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,376
go into this as well. Things like the

359
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,616
effect sizes of the various actions and

360
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:27,288
covariance. And these local parameters

361
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,356
are conditionally dependent on a set of

362
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,876
global parameters which, as we

363
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:33,340
discussed, they link information between

364
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,276
different ends and different sources of

365
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:35,980
knowledge.

366
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,456
The same global parameters are used in

367
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,688
the meta analysis model and they

368
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:45,424
actually establish the link between what

369
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:47,728
is found to happen on the ground and

370
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,080
what is reported in the literature.

371
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,844
I'm not going to go into this because I

372
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:56,516
think I'm going to run a bit long, but

373
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,396
basically the concept is that we have

374
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,860
these project nodes that correspond to

375
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,456
many farms and they're each on

376
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:06,136
independent nodes in the network that

377
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,352
are also connected to this common

378
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:12,920
metaanalysis model. And together

379
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,556
these nodes, they incorporate academic

380
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,616
studies, expert knowledge and locally

381
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:20,552
relevant context. They do so privately,

382
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:22,364
so only processing the local data

383
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:25,704
locally and through this parameter

384
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,732
sharing they actually jointly and

385
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:31,936
iteratively estimate the

386
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:34,844
global posterior in a cycle forever,

387
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,504
for as long as there is new data about

388
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,104
the project, as long as there's new

389
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:41,116
studies and new expert knowledges. So

390
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,636
all of this is happening basically in an

391
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:47,124
online way. And again, the topology can

392
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:49,316
vary, but the principles remain the

393
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:52,388
same. So, just to show a

394
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,696
little bit of how this works, this is

395
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:58,516
just two epochs of the global posteriors

396
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:01,352
and this is just location and scale for

397
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:04,456
two parameters the slope and the

398
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:08,188
intercept of the relationship between a

399
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,132
vegetation index and the tree biomass in

400
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:14,796
one given hectare of forest. And as

401
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,636
you can see, this converges pretty

402
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:19,736
quickly. It's comparable to local only

403
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:23,664
methods. And just to highlight how this

404
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:26,944
can be used, also the limits of how this

405
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:28,716
can be used to estimate source

406
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,208
reliability. Here's a really successful

407
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:32,836
example at the left. It's pretty

408
00:17:32,938 --> 00:17:34,704
straightforward to use this to estimate

409
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:38,544
reliability of satellite

410
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:42,004
data. And for other cases, like very

411
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:45,384
local, very context specific data,

412
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:47,704
you actually need more data or more data

413
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,256
from more independent sources that we

414
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,730
had in this demo here.

415
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,184
Another very useful use case of this is,

416
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,560
as we discussed, we don't have direct

417
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,396
control over what happens at a form. We

418
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:02,556
can only recommend and nudge often. We

419
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:05,916
also like a node gets sued up,

420
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,452
gets sued up for an existing project

421
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,008
that has already happened and we want to

422
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,216
find out what actions were taken in the

423
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:14,256
past. And the same generative model can

424
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:18,032
be used to estimate what happened

425
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,720
in the past. In this example, it infers

426
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,976
when planting started and when harvests

427
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:26,580
started for different fields.

428
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,356
So bringing it all together. One of the

429
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,860
applications that we've been using,

430
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,336
we've been working on it actually uses

431
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:36,164
all this machinery together to validate

432
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:38,344
claims about projects performance and to

433
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,116
estimate future performance. We've

434
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:42,920
deployed this in real world projects.

435
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,696
The examples here in this photo are by

436
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,228
are relevant to Agroforestry farms in

437
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:52,300
Colombia. And we found that this

438
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,184
actually helps the project developers

439
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:56,664
and their funders to come to a shared

440
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:58,428
understanding of how successful the

441
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,832
project is, how much it's worth in terms

442
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,988
of its impact and its fundability,

443
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:06,544
whether it should be scaled up or needs

444
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:09,568
to change course. What is the quality of

445
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,212
the strategy versus other potential

446
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,044
strategies for natural regeneration and

447
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:16,384
so on? So it's actually useful

448
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:17,956
on the ground for decision making in

449
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:21,590
this context. Cool. So finally

450
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,310
I want to talk about the end state and

451
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,640
going back to our original motivation of

452
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,816
solving everything. I forgive you for

453
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,976
your thinking. This is nice. But hey,

454
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:34,964
we've been kind of in this downward

455
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:37,144
spiral towards the metacrisis for a long

456
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,128
time and what you're telling me doesn't

457
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,636
even come close to solving everything.

458
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,596
And you're right, there's a lot of

459
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:45,564
moving pieces that need to be built and

460
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,716
connected. But here's the good news. We

461
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:51,376
can do this. There's no mystery here and

462
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,504
we don't need perfection. I love this

463
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,632
quote from Edward Fulbrook that says

464
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:58,128
that to define a policy, we don't need

465
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:01,868
exact empirical measures or optimality,

466
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,176
if one jumps from an airplane, it may be

467
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:06,804
nice to have an ultimate, but what one

468
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:10,230
really needs is a parachute. So there is

469
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,404
only so much that we can get in terms of

470
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,036
diminishing returns. What we should be

471
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:17,156
refocusing on is creating and refining

472
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,144
solutions everywhere and connecting them

473
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:22,312
everywhere. And you might be thinking

474
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,976
about how does this actually scale to

475
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:25,592
global goals and how does this actually

476
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,900
get used for scalably building

477
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,956
into the fabric of decisions in our

478
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:35,896
society. So about scaling to global

479
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:38,396
goals, I again won't be able to get into

480
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:40,364
the details, but maybe Connor mentioned

481
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:43,072
this in his presentation earlier. We

482
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,780
have actually some proof of concepts

483
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,096
that we can actually build active agents

484
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,524
that are made of active agents.

485
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:53,796
So we've shown in this paper here that a

486
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:56,630
collective of interacting active agents

487
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,584
is able to perform approximate inference

488
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:02,868
at the ensemble level. And that this

489
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:04,792
further that this happens through

490
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:09,050
specific mechanisms that are mediated by

491
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,136
cognitive capabilities like theory of

492
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:14,616
mind and goal alignment. They work

493
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,424
together to improve collective

494
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:19,500
performance by eliminating ambiguity

495
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,260
through actively exploiting diversity.

496
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,996
So that's one. And the other question is

497
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,608
how do we actually build this kind of

498
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:32,844
stuff into not just these ad hoc

499
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,216
decisions, but into really the fabric of

500
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:37,836
decision making that is our global

501
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:42,304
economic system. So, talking about here

502
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:45,328
work that I did with Casper Hesp,

503
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,196
this is a game that highlights the

504
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:50,468
ability of ants just like the ones that

505
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,452
we just described to infer true system

506
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,432
state and use it to credibly incentivize

507
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:57,272
long term positive outcomes in an

508
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:01,204
externality happy scenario. This theme

509
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:03,768
we were able to show that it works even

510
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:07,372
with adversarial bot strategies and even

511
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,848
with high uncertainty and intentional

512
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:12,460
misinformation. So you can actually get

513
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,156
these ends to work with

514
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:19,644
budgets and incentives to drive decision

515
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:21,920
making that internalize externalities

516
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,250
and compensates for collusion and

517
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,800
generates long term positive outcomes.

518
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,584
That's not all. There are other

519
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:34,036
solutions that have been around for

520
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:37,300
longer than ours that apply similar

521
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,852
principles to global decision making

522
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,592
problems in the real world at scale.

523
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:42,976
This is one case study from our partners

524
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:44,536
at Cognizance that they developed for

525
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,744
the COVID pandemic and this is not

526
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:51,736
using Active infrastormalism. This is a

527
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:54,276
combination of traditional recurrent

528
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:56,780
neural networks for prediction and

529
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,332
evolutionary optimization for

530
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,668
prescription. And it's actually able to

531
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:02,716
achieve some pretty amazing stuff. It

532
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,590
discovers a pareto front between

533
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,070
prevention of cases and economic cost.

534
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,348
It's also a showcase for hybrid human AI

535
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:14,956
intelligence. They did an initial

536
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:16,096
version of this model, then they

537
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:17,824
launched an XPRIZE, they got a bunch of

538
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,224
contributions for other models and then

539
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:23,440
they did a meta model that discovered a

540
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,812
better pareto front and even better.

541
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,556
This tool has actually been used to

542
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:32,432
advise policy in the real world. So it's

543
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,944
actually very exciting that we're

544
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,376
working with them and connecting the

545
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,728
dots, because we need to connect the

546
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,650
dots, we need to bring it all together.

547
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,504
This illustration here is just, I think,

548
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:49,020
a subset of the effects of

549
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,516
the climate change crisis, which is just

550
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:54,956
one aspect of the metacrisis on

551
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,496
humans, on our society and the economy.

552
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:00,760
And so we actually need to be able to

553
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,024
deploy solutions that work across many

554
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:04,496
different domains and to connect these

555
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,976
dots. This means two things. The first

556
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:09,068
is interoperability aligning decisions

557
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,592
across context so that we don't get

558
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:12,836
unintended consequences. And second is

559
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:15,664
reusability so being able to transport

560
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:18,656
and transfer learning and structure

561
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,076
across contexts. So for instance, using

562
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,476
that evolutionary approach from the

563
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:26,176
COVID example in our agricultural

564
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,540
context or in many other possible

565
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,304
contexts, and this takes the form of

566
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,656
libraries, of components, APIs and so

567
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,224
forth. So that's what we're working on.

568
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:36,968
So we're launching this consortium. We

569
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,364
just put up the website a few minutes

570
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:41,276
ago, and we have the goal of having a

571
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,492
minimal but functionally complete

572
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:44,750
implementation by the end of next year.

573
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,204
And this is an open project. We are

574
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:50,780
working on this at our organization

575
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,304
called Digital Guy, but we're also

576
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,400
launching this open consortium that

577
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,828
welcomes contributors from anywhere,

578
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:59,036
both active inference experts and non

579
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:02,352
experts. And we need a lot

580
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:04,432
of contributors. We need all of you

581
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:07,204
because this is the most important thing

582
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:08,724
that we could ever be working on

583
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:10,676
together. And we need your help to

584
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,320
tackle the many remaining challenges.

585
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,956
So if you want to help us build the

586
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:16,052
planetary brain, please go to

587
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:18,856
Gaiaconsortium.org or reach out to me.

588
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:21,384
You know where to find me. And together

589
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:23,608
we can design, build, and learn what it

590
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:25,780
takes to achieve planetary regeneration.

591
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,810
Thank you.

592
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,820
Barath. Thanks for the great

593
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,196
presentation. I'll post the link

594
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:39,308
to Gaia Consortium into the YouTube

595
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,408
live chat. But let me get a few quick

596
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:47,136
questions in. So here we

597
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:50,908
go. First question. This is

598
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:54,100
from Marco Lynn.

599
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,268
I agree with the critical importance of

600
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:01,236
such a project. How will you deal with

601
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:02,868
the challenges of scaling given the

602
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:04,804
dependence on real world entities like

603
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:05,620
humans,

604
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,496
dependence on real world entities like

605
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:11,288
humans for major metacrisis domains such

606
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:12,996
as geopolitics, sociocultural

607
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,804
fragmentation, and other particularly

608
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:16,520
hard sense making domains?

609
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,636
First of all hi, Marco. Yeah, thanks for

610
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:24,648
the question. And I 100% agree that I'm

611
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:26,104
not claiming that this is sufficient.

612
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,820
I'm just claiming that it's necessary.

613
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,928
We do have a

614
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,816
lot of ideas and a lot of energy that we

615
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:36,624
want to put into exactly what you

616
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:37,440
described,

617
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,076
how to weave what we're doing into the

618
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:45,124
existing incentive landscapes, whether

619
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:47,156
they're market incentives or policy

620
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:49,764
incentives. But ultimately, this needs

621
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:52,740
to be an enabler. This needs to meet

622
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,208
people where they are. And we need to be

623
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,608
cognizant that change is not going to

624
00:26:57,694 --> 00:26:59,944
happen overnight, at least not right

625
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:02,424
now. Right. Typically these things take

626
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:05,684
a while to mature and then they snap

627
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,492
into place. And we're already finding

628
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:09,148
some of this happening in some of the

629
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,910
domains that we're working on where

630
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,036
nothing happened for a very long time

631
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:15,324
and then bam, hockey stick. And we

632
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:19,004
believe that the same can happen pretty

633
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,840
much anywhere. So we're very optimistic.

634
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,572
Great. What are currently the greatest

635
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:27,040
challenges for Gaia as an organization?

636
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,424
I love that kind of ambiguous question,

637
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:31,376
like, is that the Gaia Consortium as an

638
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,416
organization or is it Gaia? But let's

639
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:35,952
hear both. What are the greatest

640
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:37,956
challenges or frictions for the

641
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:40,420
Consortium and for the bigger picture.

642
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,204
Going to I'm not going to talk about the

643
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:46,936
technical stuff for change. I'm going to

644
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,424
talk about the more meta stuff.

645
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,810
And it's actually very related to what

646
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,636
your previous presentation, Daniel,

647
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:58,376
about that paper about the Institute

648
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:01,310
talked about. And it's really related to

649
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,844
building out this common, what we were

650
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,900
calling the common cognitive kernel for

651
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,656
sense making and decision making and

652
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:16,370
relatedly breaking through this

653
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,604
culture of sort of suspicion and surf

654
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:24,836
wars and getting people trying

655
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:27,892
to stake their claim to something. So we

656
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:30,624
are, and always have been extremely

657
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:33,188
open, but it's kind of hard anyway to

658
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:37,188
build trust. So we're

659
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,704
aware that it's going to take a while to

660
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:44,216
build this trust with everybody. And I

661
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:45,704
think the only answer to that is really

662
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,548
to be as participatory and

663
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:52,140
transparent as possible. Also being

664
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,964
humble and knowing where

665
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:59,152
we don't have the answer and asking

666
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:00,690
people to help us.

667
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,720
Awesome. Any closing words or thoughts?

668
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,390
Well, if there are no further questions,

669
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,284
again, I thank you all for paying

670
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,804
attention and I'm going to be

671
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,188
reaching out a lot more. You're going to

672
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,072
hear a lot more about this consortium.

673
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,824
As I said, it was just formed. They just

674
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,744
put up a website in time for this

675
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:31,672
presentation. By the way, thanks so much

676
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:35,064
to Mahi and of course,

677
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,484
Steve and everybody else who's been part

678
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:40,856
of forming and getting this ball

679
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:45,628
to start rolling. We are very

680
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:48,030
early stage, very formative, and still

681
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,256
very client. So I

682
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:56,796
just gave you my perspective on a bunch

683
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,096
of these things, the shape of it that

684
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,460
has come from our work on this so far,

685
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,284
and even not all of it. Just a piece

686
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:07,270
that we could cover in 20 minutes or so.

687
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,928
But we are very plural.

688
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:16,520
We want to engage with you on

689
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,072
different paths, forward, different

690
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:21,656
opportunities to build things, to

691
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,864
experiment, to connect the dots, to

692
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:27,000
learn together. And ultimately,

693
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,984
we really just want to provide

694
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:33,324
a platform, a convening space, a

695
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:36,268
protocol in the classic sense of the

696
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:39,088
world, a word of a shared language, a

697
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:40,428
shared means of communication, a shared

698
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:42,800
means of understanding, to find together

699
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,104
what we need to do to actually build

700
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:49,232
this third attractor. Awesome call

701
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:52,370
Gaia trim tab. Thank you exactly.

702
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,696
Thanks so much, Daniel, and see you guys

703
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:58,400
soon. Bye bye.

704
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,970
All right.

705
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,700
What a cool presentation.
