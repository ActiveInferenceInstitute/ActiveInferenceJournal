1
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:16,777
Daniel: Welcome,

2
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,126
Raf, also co author on the paper.

3
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,434
Raf: So how are you doing?

4
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:25,615
I'm good.

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,746
What about you?

6
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:28,917
Daniel: Pretty good.

7
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:30,147
Other than this brief interval of white

8
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:32,313
light, I'm just hanging out.

9
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:36,700
Raf: Fantastic.

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,938
So I'm trying to figure out here how I

11
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:38,969
can.

12
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,302
I'm using a different slide software, so

13
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:44,563
I need to make sure that I can pull this

14
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,706
up in the right way.

15
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:47,847
So give me just a quick second.

16
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:49,996
Daniel: Yeah, great.

17
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:50,146
Raf: Cool.

18
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:54,497
Daniel: So just just to read off what's

19
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,798
coming while you figure that out.

20
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:59,077
So right now we have Ralph Kaufman, and

21
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:02,755
this presentation is going to be Gaia, an

22
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:04,994
active powered network for planetary

23
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,140
scale sense making.

24
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:09,408
Following this 30 minutes presentation,

25
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:11,646
we'll have Avel Gwynen Carlo on embedded

26
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:12,729
Normativity.

27
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:13,864
That looks perfect.

28
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:14,979
That's perfect.

29
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:16,187
Raf: Awesome.

30
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:17,271
Daniel: All right.

31
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:19,469
Thanks, Raf, to you.

32
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:20,590
Raf: Thank you.

33
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,817
All right, I was going to try to see if I

34
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,028
could blow this up to full screen, but.

35
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,383
Daniel: I got it on the stream.

36
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:31,621
Looks good on the stream.

37
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:32,725
Go for it.

38
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,834
Raf: Cool.

39
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,085
So I'm just pulling up my notes here.

40
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:40,567
All right, so let me just test that this

41
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,639
moves.

42
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:44,961
Did I just move the slide?

43
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:47,022
Great.

44
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,028
Cool.

45
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,057
All right, so as I said, hi, everyone.

46
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:52,078
It's a huge pleasure to be here and thank

47
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,098
you so much to Daniel and everybody else

48
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,117
in the Institute for organizing this.

49
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,137
I'm going to talk about what I think is

50
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,097
the single most important application of

51
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,106
active entrance.

52
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:04,132
Not as a detriment to the others, but it'

53
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:06,156
's sort of upstream of everything else.

54
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,181
And that is how do the 8 billion of us

55
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,206
humans make sense of what's going on in

56
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,224
our planet and all scales?

57
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:16,252
And how do we use that understanding to

58
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:17,267
survive as a species?

59
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:21,305
So this presentation here is a bit of a

60
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:24,334
technical presentation and it has a lot

61
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:25,344
of content.

62
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,368
It's going to move pretty fast and assume

63
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:30,390
that you're familiar with some concepts,

64
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,412
but I'm going to try to leave time for Q

65
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,421
A at the end.

66
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:35,442
So first of all, I'm going to talk about

67
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,461
the motivation behind what we're doing,

68
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,479
in particular the concepts of the meta

69
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,496
crisis and the third attractor.

70
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:43,521
Then I'll give an overview of our network

71
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,544
architecture and the application so far

72
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,569
and cover the many remaining challenges.

73
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,585
And last but not least, I plan to

74
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,603
convince you that this is the single most

75
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,622
important thing you could ever be working

76
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:53,624
on.

77
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,649
And I'm doing this because we need your

78
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:56,653
help.

79
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,677
So that's a taster of what we have.

80
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,660
As I said, let's jump right into it with

81
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,670
the motivation.

82
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:07,700
And what greater motivation could there

83
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:07,703
be?

84
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:10,732
If you haven't heard of the metacrisis,

85
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,756
it's a term that it's originally from

86
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,778
Doctor Who, but it was borrowed by

87
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,804
thinker called Daniel Schmuckenberger to

88
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,828
talk about the total risk for humanity

89
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:22,853
and the biosphere that is posed by the

90
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,876
combination of three factors.

91
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:26,897
The first being the increasing

92
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,922
interconnectedness of everything from

93
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,947
climate to food security to national

94
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:32,955
security.

95
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,979
To biodiversity and everything in between.

96
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:34,979
.

97
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,007
The second being the risks associated

98
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:40,036
with self evolving technology, including

99
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:43,064
runaway artificial intelligence and the

100
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,092
third being the increasing omnipresence

101
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,120
of coordination failures personified as

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,152
the god of coordination failures moloch.

103
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:55,180
And so the combination of these three

104
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,197
factors as hypothesized by

105
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:59,224
Schmuckenberger will lead to either one

106
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:02,190
of two attractors, one of them being

107
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,216
chaotic breakdown of all structure and

108
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:07,244
the second being a reversal to oppressive

109
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:09,264
authoritarian control.

110
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,292
And obviously both of those qualify as

111
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,317
that in my book, I assume in yours as

112
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,322
well.

113
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:18,352
So the question of course is can we

114
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:20,378
actually find a third attractor that is

115
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,407
positive sum as opposed to negative sum?

116
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:26,438
And rather the question is can we design

117
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:27,441
it?

118
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,475
So what I claim, and what we as the Guy

119
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,508
Consortium claim, is that yes we can and

120
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:36,534
we can design this attractor.

121
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,574
The design goal is basically to build

122
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,599
resilience and stabilization into our

123
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,626
biosocial economic system and to do this

124
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,654
subject to multilevel system constraints

125
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,674
like the planetary boundaries

126
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,697
desirability, meaning it has to be

127
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:55,723
something that people actually want so

128
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:57,745
they will help it happen.

129
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,762
So it needs to preserve standards of

130
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:00,711
living and so on.

131
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,730
And it needs to be feasible, it needs to

132
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,748
be achievable from our current initial

133
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:04,755
conditions.

134
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:07,780
And of course there's a lot of design

135
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,804
complicators in the mix, some of which

136
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:11,828
partial observation, there's a lot of

137
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,854
information asymmetry going on, there's a

138
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,879
lot of uncertainty about how the pieces

139
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,899
of the world system work from a

140
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,924
scientific perspective, there's obvious

141
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:24,949
computability constraints associated to

142
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:24,958
this.

143
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,987
And last but not least, you can't really

144
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:29,002
control what happens.

145
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:31,021
In most cases we can only create

146
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,044
incentives, recommendations and nudges.

147
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,084
So easy, right?

148
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,118
Of course it's not easy, but we think we

149
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:43,143
can do it if we apply the sum of the

150
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,168
principles from cybernetics that we

151
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:48,191
already know and apply them in a

152
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,220
decentralized positive sum composable way.

153
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,223
.

154
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,248
So what we're talking about here is

155
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:56,273
decentralized network, a decentralized

156
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,298
hybrid AI human network for planetary

157
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:01,266
scale decision support and automation.

158
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,312
It recognizes that we will have human and

159
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,335
artificial agents interacting by the

160
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,355
billions in an open network.

161
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,387
Its goal is to facilitate both

162
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,409
continuance or model alignment and

163
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,434
coherence or goal alignment at multiple

164
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:21,460
levels or scales up to the global scale,

165
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,485
meaning the survival of the system as a

166
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:24,492
whole.

167
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:26,519
It will need to feature built in

168
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,545
incentives and governance and it will

169
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:31,567
need to be privacy preserving,

170
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,579
intrinsically.

171
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,609
So the below listed participants are

172
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:39,642
participants, founders of the consortium.

173
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:39,643
.

174
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:40,658
I'm going to talk about it later.

175
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,691
So this is the framing, this is the

176
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:45,706
motivation for what we're doing.

177
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:48,734
And now I'm going to give a whirlwind

178
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:51,762
tour of the architecture so far and I'm

179
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:54,790
going to cover mostly what we've built,

180
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,819
the version of this architecture that we'

181
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,845
've built so far, thinking about this

182
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:00,796
explicitly.

183
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,815
And then I'm going to talk about how this

184
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:04,831
connects to other architectures that

185
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,847
already exist in the world, just very

186
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:06,852
briefly.

187
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,882
So we've been framing this as an

188
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,915
architecture for building decentralized

189
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,949
digital twins, which are local models of

190
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,985
real world systems that run in network.

191
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,013
And the role that such digital twins play

192
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,034
is that they help us understand the costs

193
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:26,055
and benefits of strategies and projects

194
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:28,072
that happen in the real world.

195
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,107
And in our organization, Digital Gaia, we

196
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:34,134
started out caring primarily about

197
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,146
agroecology.

198
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:38,175
So how do you actually make better

199
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:42,210
decisions, meaning better recommendations,

200
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,243
, negotiations, valuations, investments

201
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:48,273
into a farm, into a forest, into bio

202
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:51,306
landscape, to make it better, to make it

203
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,337
more likely to survive and thrive.

204
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:59,381
So, as practical implementation, it needs

205
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,357
to tackle several real world challenges.

206
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,387
First of all, it needs to handle

207
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:08,411
distributed, non IID data.

208
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,429
Data is sparse.

209
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,454
It's heterogeneous, it's private, it's

210
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,469
potentially unreliable.

211
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,493
It needs to enable localized

212
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,515
collaborative forecasting and planning,

213
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,534
personalized planning and privacy

214
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,542
preserving.

215
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,573
It needs to accept the fact that it won't

216
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:27,600
be able to directly control, but only

217
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,627
recommended nudge, as we discussed.

218
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:33,664
And the outline of what we came up with

219
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:36,691
is this concept of the Guy Network, which

220
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,715
is a mesh of AI agents called natural

221
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:41,741
entities, or Ants for short, that act as

222
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:43,764
proxies for real world systems.

223
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,802
Each ant runs on an engine called Tengor,

224
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:50,833
which it uses to inquire, learn, plan,

225
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,854
and allocate resources.

226
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:55,880
And ants communicate in a language called

227
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,891
the Guy Protocol.

228
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:59,923
They use this language to independently

229
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,881
interact with their environments and each

230
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:01,884
other.

231
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,911
And if we do this right I'll show a bit

232
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,935
more of this later, but if we do this

233
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,956
right, the Guy network's behavior

234
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,979
approximates a single composite agent

235
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,003
that handles, that interacts with and

236
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:16,030
couples with its global environment.

237
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:17,048
Cool.

238
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:20,078
So just to give you an overview of how

239
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,106
this works under the hood, the Fangor

240
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:26,131
engine is really the heart of our

241
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,143
architecture.

242
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:29,167
And the core loop that is mentioned here

243
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,188
is a typical active inference loop.

244
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,203
But to make this work in very

245
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,223
heterogeneous and distributed context,

246
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,239
there's lots of work involved.

247
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,262
So just some highlights that I think are

248
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:41,280
going to be particularly interesting for

249
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,286
this crowd.

250
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,317
First of all, so as I said, the same core

251
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,341
engine needs to be able to work for very

252
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,357
heterogeneous contexts.

253
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:51,383
So each agent has access to a library of

254
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,395
generative models.

255
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,419
And these models are specified using a

256
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,441
Python based probabilistic programming

257
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:59,465
DSL, and they declare what context they'

258
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,426
're appropriate for using a shared

259
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:02,432
ontology.

260
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,455
Using that ontology, Fangorn can then

261
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,477
select the most appropriate model to use

262
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:08,497
online, given the configurations, like

263
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,518
project configurations and the kinds of

264
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:12,536
observational data available.

265
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,567
So using a model that's appropriate for

266
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,596
farm or for forest, what kind of farm,

267
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,621
what kind of forest, what kind of

268
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,649
ecosystem, what kind of their context

269
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:27,680
energy project I'm going to get into the

270
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,709
examples right now because there's more

271
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,736
on the applications later on.

272
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:35,763
So we end up with a network of

273
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:38,796
heterogeneous agents, but that's okay.

274
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:41,829
They actually form a single model in a

275
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,856
formal sense because they're all

276
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,889
connected hierarchically by a system of

277
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,903
hyperparators.

278
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,925
And this means that Fangor needs to

279
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:54,950
support inference of generic hierarchical

280
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,961
generative models.

281
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,982
And we actually do this automatically

282
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:59,999
using approximate posteriors with

283
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:00,953
structural constraints.

284
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,991
And so we have this global model that

285
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,011
connects all the nodes and describes

286
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,033
general facts that apply over multiple

287
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,040
contexts.

288
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,065
And this means the whole network needs to

289
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:13,086
jointly perform inference over this

290
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,107
global model using a peer to peer or

291
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,120
federated algorithm.

292
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,142
So initially the way this works is

293
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,165
initially the network sets the global

294
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,188
posterior to be the same as the global

295
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:24,193
prior.

296
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:26,215
Each node then independently performs

297
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,236
local optimization of the variational

298
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:30,253
free energy and then passes the

299
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:32,275
parameters of the new global solution to

300
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,297
the peers in the network where they use

301
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,310
it as a hyperprior.

302
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,332
And this works over a broad range of

303
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,353
topologies and under pretty general

304
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:41,361
constraints.

305
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,386
And by the way, I'd like to mention that

306
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:46,410
there's a lot of overlap and interaction

307
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,434
between the stuff that I'm talking about

308
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,457
here and some of the other presentations

309
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:53,479
that you're seeing today and I wasn't

310
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,504
able to reference them explicitly in this

311
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:57,526
talk, but I'm sure you're going to see

312
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:59,543
the connections cool.

313
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,509
So what it turns out is that the shared

314
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,531
parameters that represent our global

315
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,553
model are effectively stored by the

316
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,577
network stored in a federated parameter

317
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,600
store, meaning that each node stores

318
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,622
their own local parameters, they're

319
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:15,645
private stuffed about their own local

320
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:18,669
context and multiple nodes store copies

321
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,690
of the global parameters.

322
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,721
And this architecture, because it

323
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:25,746
supports heterogeneous local models, it

324
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,770
actually allows us to introduce another

325
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,792
kind of nodes which we call ant mood

326
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:30,799
nodes.

327
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,823
These are nodes that aggregate scientific

328
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,844
and empirical information using a meta

329
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:36,854
analysis model.

330
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:39,883
And we actually are able to use that meta

331
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,909
analysis model to constrain our project

332
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,935
level models or ants using quote unquote

333
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:47,961
imported knowledge that wasn't directly

334
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:49,988
observed by them, which is left to right

335
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:51,002
in this picture.

336
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,023
But this actually also goes two ways.

337
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:55,046
So empirical findings from the project,

338
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,066
what actually works on the ground for

339
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:59,088
this particular project also informs the

340
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:02,051
ant modes posteriors which is the right

341
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:02,057
to left.

342
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:05,085
And so we actually have a complete cycle

343
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,111
of science and empirics all implemented

344
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,137
using hierarchical active inference.

345
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:14,175
So finally, just among the global

346
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:16,196
parameters that network learns by

347
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,221
federated inference are the precisions

348
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,244
associated with data coming from the

349
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:23,263
different data providers.

350
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:25,287
And this gives each node a way to consume

351
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,308
data without trusted ground truth and

352
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:30,331
basically to learn together which sources

353
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,349
they can rely on it for what?

354
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:35,385
This is just some of more core features.

355
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:37,404
We're working on integrating many other

356
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,422
capabilities into this architecture.

357
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:42,449
Not going to go through all of this, but

358
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,475
basically what we're finding is that we

359
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,502
have all the building blocks to turn this

360
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,526
into a full feature decision network

361
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:52,552
complete with its own internal knowledge

362
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,578
economy, meaning that contributions get

363
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:57,604
attributed and rewarded in proportion to

364
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,627
the free energy reduction that they

365
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:00,578
afford.

366
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:03,601
Cool.

367
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,626
So, jumping into applications, as I

368
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,648
mentioned, our main focus as an

369
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,671
organization has been on modeling

370
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,700
agroecological projects like regenerative

371
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,724
agriculture and agroforestry.

372
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,742
And this exercises all the constraints

373
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:18,756
that we've talked about so far.

374
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,784
So again, I'm not going to go into full

375
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,807
detail, but just to give an overview of

376
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,831
what is the anatomy of generative model

377
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,845
for a farm or forest.

378
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,866
So start at the bottom right with

379
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:32,889
observables that are things that we can

380
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,913
measure about that ecosystem, about that

381
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:36,936
local context like the plant count and

382
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,960
size, vegetation indices from satellite

383
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,972
data and so on.

384
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,004
These are linked to latent states which

385
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:46,036
form a nonlinear dynamical system that's

386
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:49,063
parameterized by the policy the the

387
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:52,093
things that modulate the latent states

388
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:55,121
like agricultural interventions and

389
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,133
practices.

390
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:58,158
You can think of the timing of planting

391
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,121
and harvesting, what kinds of crops or

392
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:03,143
trees get planted, what products like

393
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:05,165
pesticides get applied or not, and more

394
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,181
as well as covariates.

395
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:09,206
So external events like weather, physical

396
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:11,228
risks, wildfire, drought and so on.

397
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:16,272
And so there's some scientific and

398
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:20,312
measurement parameters that go into this

399
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:21,322
as well.

400
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,344
Things like the effect sizes of the

401
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:25,364
various actions and covariance.

402
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,382
And these local parameters are

403
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:29,401
conditionally dependent on a set of

404
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,424
global parameters which, as we discussed,

405
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:33,445
they link information between different

406
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:35,469
ends and different sources of knowledge.

407
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,522
The same global parameters are used in

408
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:43,547
the meta analysis model and they actually

409
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:46,570
establish the link between what is found

410
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,591
to happen on the ground and what is

411
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:50,610
reported in the literature.

412
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:54,653
I'm not going to go into this because I

413
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,676
think I'm going to run a bit long, but

414
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,698
basically the concept is that we have

415
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:01,662
these project nodes that correspond to

416
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,680
many farms and they're each on

417
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,705
independent nodes in the network that are

418
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:07,723
also connected to this common

419
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:08,738
metaanalysis model.

420
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,769
And together these nodes, they

421
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,804
incorporate academic studies, expert

422
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:19,844
knowledge and locally relevant context.

423
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,873
They do so privately, so only processing

424
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,901
the local data locally and through this

425
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,929
parameter sharing they actually jointly

426
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,954
and iteratively estimate the global

427
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:33,983
posterior in a cycle forever, for as long

428
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,011
as there is new data about the project,

429
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:38,039
as long as there's new studies and new

430
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,057
expert knowledges.

431
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:43,087
So all of this is happening basically in

432
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,099
an online way.

433
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,129
And again, the topology can vary, but the

434
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,149
principles remain the same.

435
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,185
So, just to show a little bit of how this

436
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:56,215
works, this is just two epochs of the

437
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,244
global posteriors and this is just

438
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:02,218
location and scale for two parameters the

439
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:05,243
slope and the intercept of the

440
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:08,276
relationship between a vegetation index

441
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:12,310
and the tree biomass in one given hectare

442
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,324
of forest.

443
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:16,354
And as you can see, this converges pretty

444
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,360
quickly.

445
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,396
It's comparable to local only methods.

446
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,432
And just to highlight how this can be

447
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:27,459
used, also the limits of how this can be

448
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,485
used to estimate source reliability.

449
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,507
Here's a really successful example at the

450
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,510
left.

451
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,544
It's pretty straightforward to use this

452
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:39,581
to estimate reliability of satellite data.

453
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:39,582
.

454
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,609
And for other cases, like very local,

455
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,636
very context specific data, you actually

456
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:47,661
need more data or more data from more

457
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,687
independent sources that we had in this

458
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:50,696
demo here.

459
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:55,742
Another very useful use case of this is,

460
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,766
as we discussed, we don't have direct

461
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,732
control over what happens at a form.

462
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:02,753
We can only recommend and nudge often.

463
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:04,776
We also like a node gets sued up, gets

464
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,799
sued up for an existing project that has

465
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,823
already happened and we want to find out

466
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,846
what actions were taken in the past.

467
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:15,882
And the same generative model can be used

468
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:18,915
to estimate what happened in the past.

469
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,949
In this example, it infers when planting

470
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:25,979
started and when harvests started for

471
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,995
different fields.

472
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,002
So bringing it all together.

473
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,004
One of the applications that we've been

474
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,006
using, we've been working on it actually

475
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:35,008
uses all this machinery together to

476
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,010
validate claims about projects

477
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,011
performance and to estimate future

478
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,012
performance.

479
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:42,015
We've deployed this in real world

480
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,015
projects.

481
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,019
The examples here in this photo are by

482
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,022
are relevant to Agroforestry farms in

483
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:50,023
Colombia.

484
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,025
And we found that this actually helps the

485
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:55,028
project developers and their funders to

486
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,030
come to a shared understanding of how

487
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,027
successful the project is, how much it's

488
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,029
worth in terms of its impact and its

489
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:05,032
fundability, whether it should be scaled

490
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:07,034
up or needs to change course.

491
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:10,036
What is the quality of the strategy

492
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,039
versus other potential strategies for

493
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,040
natural regeneration and so on?

494
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,043
So it's actually useful on the ground for

495
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,045
decision making in this context.

496
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,046
Cool.

497
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,050
So finally I want to talk about the end

498
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,053
state and going back to our original

499
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:28,055
motivation of solving everything.

500
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,057
I forgive you for your thinking.

501
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,058
This is nice.

502
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,060
But hey, we've been kind of in this

503
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,062
downward spiral towards the metacrisis

504
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,064
for a long time and what you're telling

505
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,066
me doesn't even come close to solving

506
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,067
everything.

507
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,070
And you're right, there's a lot of moving

508
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,072
pieces that need to be built and

509
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,073
connected.

510
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,074
But here's the good news.

511
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,076
We can do this.

512
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:52,079
There's no mystery here and we don't need

513
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,079
perfection.

514
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,082
I love this quote from Edward Fulbrook

515
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:58,085
that says that to define a policy, we don'

516
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,081
't need exact empirical measures or

517
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:03,084
optimality, if one jumps from an airplane,

518
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,086
, it may be nice to have an ultimate, but

519
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:08,089
what one really needs is a parachute.

520
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,092
So there is only so much that we can get

521
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,094
in terms of diminishing returns.

522
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:15,096
What we should be refocusing on is

523
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,098
creating and refining solutions

524
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:19,100
everywhere and connecting them everywhere.

525
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
.

526
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:23,104
And you might be thinking about how does

527
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,107
this actually scale to global goals and

528
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,110
how does this actually get used for

529
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,112
scalably building into the fabric of

530
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:33,114
decisions in our society.

531
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,117
So about scaling to global goals, I again

532
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,119
won't be able to get into the details,

533
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,121
but maybe Connor mentioned this in his

534
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,123
presentation earlier.

535
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,126
We have actually some proof of concepts

536
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,129
that we can actually build active agents

537
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:51,132
that are made of active agents.

538
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,135
So we've shown in this paper here that a

539
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:57,137
collective of interacting active agents

540
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:59,140
is able to perform approximate inference

541
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,136
at the ensemble level.

542
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,139
And that this further that this happens

543
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,142
through specific mechanisms that are

544
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,145
mediated by cognitive capabilities like

545
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,148
theory of mind and goal alignment.

546
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:17,152
They work together to improve collective

547
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,154
performance by eliminating ambiguity

548
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,158
through actively exploiting diversity.

549
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
So that's one.

550
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,163
And the other question is how do we

551
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,166
actually build this kind of stuff into

552
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,168
not just these ad hoc decisions, but into

553
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,171
really the fabric of decision making that

554
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,173
is our global economic system.

555
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,176
So, talking about here work that I did

556
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,179
with Casper Hesp, this is a game that

557
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,182
highlights the ability of ants just like

558
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,185
the ones that we just described to infer

559
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,188
true system state and use it to credibly

560
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,191
incentivize long term positive outcomes

561
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,194
in an externality happy scenario.

562
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,191
This theme we were able to show that it

563
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:05,194
works even with adversarial bot

564
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,197
strategies and even with high uncertainty

565
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,199
and intentional misinformation.

566
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:14,203
So you can actually get these ends to

567
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:17,206
work with budgets and incentives to drive

568
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,209
decision making that internalize

569
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,212
externalities and compensates for

570
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:26,215
collusion and generates long term

571
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,217
positive outcomes.

572
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,219
That's not all.

573
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:33,222
There are other solutions that have been

574
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:35,224
around for longer than ours that apply

575
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,226
similar principles to global decision

576
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:39,228
making problems in the real world at

577
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:40,229
scale.

578
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,232
This is one case study from our partners

579
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,235
at Cognizance that they developed for the

580
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,237
COVID pandemic and this is not using

581
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:50,239
Active infrastormalism.

582
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,242
This is a combination of traditional

583
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,244
recurrent neural networks for prediction

584
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:58,247
and evolutionary optimization for

585
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:59,248
prescription.

586
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:01,244
And it's actually able to achieve some

587
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,245
pretty amazing stuff.

588
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:05,248
It discovers a pareto front between

589
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:09,252
prevention of cases and economic cost.

590
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,256
It's also a showcase for hybrid human AI

591
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
intelligence.

592
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:16,259
They did an initial version of this model,

593
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,262
, then they launched an XPRIZE, they got

594
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,265
a bunch of contributions for other models

595
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:24,267
and then they did a meta model that

596
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:27,270
discovered a better pareto front and even

597
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,270
better.

598
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,272
This tool has actually been used to

599
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,274
advise policy in the real world.

600
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,276
So it's actually very exciting that we're

601
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:36,279
working with them and connecting the dots,

602
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,281
, because we need to connect the dots, we

603
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,283
need to bring it all together.

604
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:45,288
This illustration here is just, I think,

605
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:48,291
a subset of the effects of the climate

606
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:52,294
change crisis, which is just one aspect

607
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:55,298
of the metacrisis on humans, on our

608
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,300
society and the economy.

609
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,302
And so we actually need to be able to

610
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:02,299
deploy solutions that work across many

611
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,301
different domains and to connect these

612
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,302
dots.

613
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:06,303
This means two things.

614
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:08,305
The first is interoperability aligning

615
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,307
decisions across context so that we don't

616
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:11,308
get unintended consequences.

617
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:15,312
And second is reusability so being able

618
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:17,314
to transport and transfer learning and

619
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:20,317
structure across contexts.

620
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,319
So for instance, using that evolutionary

621
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,321
approach from the COVID example in our

622
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,323
agricultural context or in many other

623
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,325
possible contexts, and this takes the

624
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,328
form of libraries, of components, APIs

625
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,329
and so forth.

626
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,332
So that's what we're working on.

627
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:36,333
So we're launching this consortium.

628
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,335
We just put up the website a few minutes

629
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:40,337
ago, and we have the goal of having a

630
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:42,339
minimal but functionally complete

631
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,341
implementation by the end of next year.

632
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:47,344
And this is an open project.

633
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:49,346
We are working on this at our

634
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:51,348
organization called Digital Guy, but we'

635
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,351
're also launching this open consortium

636
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,353
that welcomes contributors from anywhere,

637
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:59,356
both active inference experts and non

638
00:24:59,356 --> 00:24:59,356
experts.

639
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,354
And we need a lot of contributors.

640
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,356
We need all of you because this is the

641
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:07,358
most important thing that we could ever

642
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,360
be working on together.

643
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,362
And we need your help to tackle the many

644
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:12,363
remaining challenges.

645
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:14,365
So if you want to help us build the

646
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,367
planetary brain, please go to

647
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,369
Gaiaconsortium.org or reach out to me.

648
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,371
You know where to find me.

649
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,373
And together we can design, build, and

650
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,375
learn what it takes to achieve planetary

651
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,376
regeneration.

652
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:26,377
Thank you.

653
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Daniel: Barath.

654
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,383
Thanks for the great presentation.

655
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:37,388
I'll post the link to Gaia Consortium

656
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:40,391
into the YouTube live chat.

657
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:44,395
But let me get a few quick questions in.

658
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,398
So here we go.

659
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,400
First question.

660
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:54,405
This is from Marco Lynn.

661
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:59,410
I agree with the critical importance of

662
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,405
such a project.

663
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,407
How will you deal with the challenges of

664
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,409
scaling given the dependence on real

665
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:07,412
world entities like humans, dependence on

666
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,414
real world entities like humans for major

667
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,416
metacrisis domains such as geopolitics,

668
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,418
sociocultural fragmentation, and other

669
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:16,421
particularly hard sense making domains?

670
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:19,424
Raf: First of all hi, Marco.

671
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,426
Yeah, thanks for the question.

672
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:24,429
And I 100% agree that I'm not claiming

673
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,431
that this is sufficient.

674
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:27,432
I'm just claiming that it's necessary.

675
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,436
We do have a lot of ideas and a lot of

676
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:35,440
energy that we want to put into exactly

677
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,443
what you described, how to weave what we'

678
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:42,446
're doing into the existing incentive

679
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,449
landscapes, whether they're market

680
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:48,452
incentives or policy incentives.

681
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:51,456
But ultimately, this needs to be an

682
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:51,456
enabler.

683
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:53,458
This needs to meet people where they are.

684
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
.

685
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,461
And we need to be cognizant that change

686
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,463
is not going to happen overnight, at

687
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,459
least not right now.

688
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
Right.

689
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,462
Typically these things take a while to

690
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:06,465
mature and then they snap into place.

691
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:08,467
And we're already finding some of this

692
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:10,469
happening in some of the domains that we'

693
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,471
're working on where nothing happened for

694
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,473
a very long time and then bam, hockey

695
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:14,473
stick.

696
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:18,477
And we believe that the same can happen

697
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:20,479
pretty much anywhere.

698
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,480
So we're very optimistic.

699
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:23,481
Daniel: Great.

700
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:24,483
What are currently the greatest

701
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:27,486
challenges for Gaia as an organization?

702
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,488
I love that kind of ambiguous question,

703
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:31,490
like, is that the Gaia Consortium as an

704
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,492
organization or is it Gaia?

705
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:34,493
But let's hear both.

706
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:37,496
What are the greatest challenges or

707
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,498
frictions for the Consortium and for the

708
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:40,499
bigger picture.

709
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,503
Raf: Going to I'm not going to talk about

710
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,505
the technical stuff for change.

711
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,508
I'm going to talk about the more meta

712
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:50,509
stuff.

713
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:53,512
And it's actually very related to what

714
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,514
your previous presentation, Daniel, about

715
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:58,517
that paper about the Institute talked

716
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,518
about.

717
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:03,516
And it's really related to building out

718
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,519
this common, what we were calling the

719
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,523
common cognitive kernel for sense making

720
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,526
and decision making and relatedly

721
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,530
breaking through this culture of sort of

722
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,534
suspicion and surf wars and getting

723
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:25,538
people trying to stake their claim to

724
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,539
something.

725
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,543
So we are, and always have been extremely

726
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,545
open, but it's kind of hard anyway to

727
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,546
build trust.

728
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,550
So we're aware that it's going to take a

729
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,554
while to build this trust with everybody.

730
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
.

731
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,557
And I think the only answer to that is

732
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,561
really to be as participatory and

733
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,563
transparent as possible.

734
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:55,567
Also being humble and knowing where we

735
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,572
don't have the answer and asking people

736
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,567
to help us.

737
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:03,570
Daniel: Awesome.

738
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,573
Any closing words or thoughts?

739
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:12,579
Raf: Well, if there are no further

740
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:16,583
questions, again, I thank you all for

741
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:20,587
paying attention and I'm going to be

742
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:22,589
reaching out a lot more.

743
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,591
You're going to hear a lot more about

744
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:25,592
this consortium.

745
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:26,593
As I said, it was just formed.

746
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:28,595
They just put up a website in time for

747
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:29,596
this presentation.

748
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:33,600
By the way, thanks so much to Mahi and of

749
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,603
course, Steve and everybody else who's

750
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:39,606
been part of forming and getting this

751
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:42,609
ball to start rolling.

752
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:47,613
We are very early stage, very formative,

753
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,616
and still very client.

754
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:53,620
So I just gave you my perspective on a

755
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,624
bunch of these things, the shape of it

756
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:01,622
that has come from our work on this so

757
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,625
far, and even not all of it.

758
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,627
Just a piece that we could cover in 20

759
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:07,628
minutes or so.

760
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,631
But we are very plural.

761
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:14,635
We want to engage with you on different

762
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:18,639
paths, forward, different opportunities

763
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,642
to build things, to experiment, to

764
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:24,645
connect the dots, to learn together.

765
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:27,648
And ultimately, we really just want to

766
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:30,651
provide a platform, a convening space, a

767
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:33,654
protocol in the classic sense of the

768
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,656
world, a word of a shared language, a

769
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:38,659
shared means of communication, a shared

770
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,662
means of understanding, to find together

771
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,665
what we need to do to actually build this

772
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:46,667
third attractor.

773
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:50,671
Daniel: Awesome call Gaia trim tab.

774
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:52,673
Raf: Thank you exactly.

775
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:55,676
Thanks so much, Daniel, and see you guys

776
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:56,676
soon.

777
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,679
Daniel: Bye bye.

778
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:01,676
All right.

779
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,680
What a cool presentation.
