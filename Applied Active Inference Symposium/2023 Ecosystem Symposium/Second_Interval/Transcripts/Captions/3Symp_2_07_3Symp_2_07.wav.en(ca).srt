1
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:25,685
Daniel: All right.

2
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:34,521
The next presentation is with Pablo

3
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:38,904
Fernandez-Maquieira.

4
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:40,111
So welcome back, Pablo.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,557
Pablo: Hello here.

6
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:47,802
Daniel: Okay, I did take us on an

7
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:48,968
adventure of curiosity.

8
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,113
Pablo: Yes.

9
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:52,371
I'm going to start sharing my screen.

10
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,638
Let me know if everything is all right.

11
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,643
Daniel: Should be perfect.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:02,792
Pablo: Yes.

13
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:03,877
Cool.

14
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:11,626
So this is one of my favorite memes and

15
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:15,020
probably most of you know it.

16
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:22,729
This reference is the cave of Platon and

17
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:28,319
to me it was kind of fine treated truth

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,940
that now with active inference seems like

19
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,424
we are closer to demonstrate.

20
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:41,615
That how it is.

21
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:47,029
So the first time that I start act and

22
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:54,090
surf at the Institute, this was kind of

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,091
my feeling or my face was looking into

24
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:06,154
something that it was complex, scary and

25
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:09,188
look interesting.

26
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:17,268
So I went why I decided to go through it.

27
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:17,268
.

28
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,328
I envision a world where people is

29
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:26,355
driving by stronger incentives that

30
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,385
motivate them to reduce uncertainty in

31
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:32,411
the systems they are part of.

32
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:36,452
My approach is through games which are

33
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:37,466
going to go later.

34
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:41,502
But I really on this talk, want to

35
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:45,543
encourage all kinds of persons or people

36
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,563
that are curious.

37
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:51,607
And I want them to act and get involved

38
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:53,627
in the community.

39
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,682
Because you may find that for now most of

40
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:04,671
the actors are scientists and very well

41
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:06,696
on reputed people.

42
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:11,741
And you might think that you are not a

43
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,787
part of it, but very far away from that.

44
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:16,799
The Institute.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,822
Encourage the opposite.

46
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,852
So I'm super glad to have been through

47
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,880
this journey and I wanted to share a

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,910
little bit of my background and then we

49
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,924
go to the game.

50
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,973
Here is the second and last meme.

51
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:37,003
The world you were raised to survive is

52
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,016
no longer exist.

53
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:42,053
We are on digital revolution and with

54
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:46,091
this digital revolution it comes a bunch

55
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:50,130
of different things that are evolving and

56
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,169
hopefully bring us to a better world.

57
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,198
Okay, who I am?

58
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,208
I'm Pablo.

59
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,217
My name is Pablo.

60
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:03,202
But more defined or what best define me

61
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,238
is my action and my experiences.

62
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,349
I think role gameplays and sports movies

63
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:22,395
are super important and as a kid I was

64
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:27,442
dyslexic and the system didn't fill my

65
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,460
necessities.

66
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:32,492
So I really hated school.

67
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,524
But I love learning and it's something

68
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:38,550
that I've been doing all my life.

69
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:42,591
And it's curious how a system that is

70
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:46,630
designed to give you knowledge and to

71
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,674
help you with the learning, in my case it

72
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,698
didn't work at all.

73
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:59,759
That's a little starting point.

74
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:05,762
I believe in the copy transformation and

75
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:10,814
combine of things and on my adulthood

76
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:14,858
everything shifted and I became

77
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:20,917
successful, professional and I love it.

78
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:21,926
Teams.

79
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:28,993
What I do for a living is product manager

80
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,036
and what I do on my pet projects site

81
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:37,083
projects, call it as you want is related

82
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:42,131
to gaming and gamifying organizations and

83
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,149
experiences.

84
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:49,208
Nowadays I trust more my intuition which

85
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:53,239
is something that it really was broken

86
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:56,271
during my childhood and you will see a

87
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,296
little bit more about that.

88
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:01,261
Here are some things of my interest.

89
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:05,300
Licenses like open science which is the

90
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,335
case of the Institute philosophy that's

91
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,368
the first meme education, governance,

92
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:14,398
family, art, love, communication,

93
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:18,430
technology and nature and a bunch of

94
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,462
other things that I will be happy to

95
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,486
share any other time.

96
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:29,541
One of the questions that Daniel asked me

97
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,580
for this talk is what was exciting for me

98
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,608
about all this, what right?

99
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:40,650
And for me, when I give talks, I like to

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,689
share a view of the last hundred years

101
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,731
and the Industrial revolution and how the

102
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:52,770
ones that were on this world before us

103
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,795
did something right.

104
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:59,842
I'm sure that we all know big mistakes or

105
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:03,828
big things that have failed or that could

106
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:07,862
be better through iterations.

107
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:14,931
But on data it's very promising and very

108
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:15,941
good.

109
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:20,995
I think it's inspiring to have the basic

110
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:25,044
education, how it grows, the vaccination,

111
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,088
what it did for us, democracy and how

112
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:34,136
poverty dropped draxily, how literacy it

113
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:39,184
grew and because all these things, child

114
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:43,224
mortality just went very low.

115
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:49,287
So basically the future of education is

116
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:52,315
what makes me be excited.

117
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,368
How I ended up on this ecosystem.

118
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:01,343
It's super random and I'm going to

119
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:04,376
explain it in hopefully two to five

120
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:05,386
minutes.

121
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:08,419
I as a product manager and very

122
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,444
interested on technology.

123
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,487
I heard about Blockchains back in 2015

124
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:19,528
and I didn't understood anything at all.

125
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,577
And then back in 2017 I heard about a I

126
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:29,627
didn't start them, did not play that game.

127
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:29,629
.

128
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,665
But it was raising a fun thing to

129
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:37,705
consider, which is digital assets and

130
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:41,743
ownership of those digital assets.

131
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:47,800
For now, we didn't have a technology that

132
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,840
could scale and that was good enough to

133
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,881
ensure that the digital assets that you

134
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:58,916
own were you yours and you had the

135
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,894
freedom of transaction on them.

136
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,925
I did understand that very fast and

137
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,958
because I'm a game player and as a game

138
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,990
player you always have your different

139
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,018
assets and do things with them.

140
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:21,082
And as well, I have been collecting music

141
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:26,131
and all kind of digital assets.

142
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:30,173
I bought this very famous collection of

143
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:34,211
punks and sold them very fast before I

144
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,236
could be a millionaire.

145
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:40,270
But due to in 2021 I decided that I

146
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,289
wanted to build something.

147
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,328
And then back then I went through this

148
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:49,367
beautiful project that was the first art

149
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:53,407
saw on Ethereum, which one of the artists

150
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,432
it was Daniel Friedman.

151
00:09:56,434 --> 00:10:01,420
So I, as a curious person and person that

152
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,463
has been working with artists, I always

153
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:09,508
like to know what is the driver of those

154
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:14,552
artists, what they do, and try to get in

155
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:18,597
their walls, to understand better and to

156
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:23,642
get as much information as I can before I

157
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:27,684
decide to encourage or collect or just

158
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:31,726
always deeper on music or art.

159
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:36,771
For me, is very nice thing to do.

160
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:41,825
So I discovered these cards and education

161
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,847
was one of them.

162
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:47,888
And I went through Flickr which is where

163
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:51,926
it was the first at least that I found

164
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,947
place where it was.

165
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:54,958
And the license.

166
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,993
It was Creative Commons license of not

167
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:02,971
commercial use but it was an open license

168
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,004
which I been part of Creative Commons

169
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:08,039
community for a very long time since I

170
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,077
was working with musicians and I think it'

171
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:16,113
's one of the best things that happened

172
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,131
to the internet.

173
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,186
These are some of the pragmatic things

174
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:26,217
that the audience cares about.

175
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:30,258
Hopefully we will have some of these on

176
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,269
our games.

177
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:36,314
AI for sure is going to be there.

178
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:42,374
Free energy principle is going to be one

179
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:46,412
of the things that hopefully we help to

180
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,446
minimize and to make it funnier.

181
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:53,480
Games or happier games and games that

182
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,510
help organizations to be better.

183
00:11:57,522 --> 00:12:00,494
The human factor, it's super important

184
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:01,501
for me.

185
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,530
And implementation and action I learned

186
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,560
by doing and it's one of the values that

187
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,584
the Institute encouraged more.

188
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,617
So I just jump on things and try to

189
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:16,654
understand them through doing and sharing

190
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,671
as I'm doing now.

191
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:24,734
Here are the epistemics and collective is

192
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:28,771
one of them that I'm as well.

193
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:32,811
Super interest agents, of course,

194
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:36,853
practical and curiosity which is the

195
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:41,901
adventure that I have the feeling that I'

196
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:45,947
'm being involved all my life and that I

197
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:49,988
encourage always my two girls to be

198
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:53,029
curious and to open things and look

199
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,079
behind the doors and just be an active.

200
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,049
Here are some values that I like to point

201
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,074
which are exploration, the culture of

202
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,099
curiosity that I did mention a lot.

203
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:11,149
Continuous learning because that

204
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,175
experience on the school.

205
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:18,210
I think I just keep going and keep going

206
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,243
and it's something that sometimes bad

207
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:24,279
experiences could turn out in good habits.

208
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,281
.

209
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:29,323
Learning by doing, as I already told.

210
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:33,362
Integrity and inclusivity.

211
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:38,411
Honesty, accountability, a big one.

212
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:40,437
Trying to be professional on everything

213
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,444
that you do.

214
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:46,489
For me, I started as human being.

215
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,534
Curious people of all backgrounds and

216
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:55,584
perspectives are welcome to the Institute.

217
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:55,585
.

218
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:01,585
I would be very happy to be the link and

219
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:05,626
to speak with someone that has doubts or

220
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,647
if I couldn't help.

221
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,672
I think I could help on the very early

222
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:10,676
stage.

223
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,709
If you're not very technical person, I

224
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,722
think I could help.

225
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:21,781
There we are learning by doing.

226
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:25,828
I would love to everyone that's on the

227
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:30,871
stream, I'm going to share this link

228
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,917
which is a new game that we are testing

229
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:39,965
and I'm excited to share it with you.

230
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,019
It's the adventure of Curiosity and here

231
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,026
Daniel.

232
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:51,081
I'm going to copy and paste the link.

233
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,111
It would be awesome.

234
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:54,115
Daniel: Okay.

235
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,135
There's a tiny typo on your slides.

236
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:58,156
It just ends with a curiosity.

237
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,120
Pablo: Thank you.

238
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:03,146
Daniel: But I'm going to paste it into

239
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:05,162
the YouTube live chat.

240
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,190
Pablo: Okay, thank you.

241
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,217
Yeah, I told you I'm a Dyslexic.

242
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:14,252
I have all kind of titles throughout my

243
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:14,258
life.

244
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,272
Sorry for that.

245
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:23,346
I always try to improve share the.

246
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,362
Daniel: Yeah, I put it in the YouTube

247
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:26,377
chat so people can head over there.

248
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:27,383
All right, yeah.

249
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,398
Could you tell us about this platform?

250
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,422
And this is the first active game?

251
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:39,503
Pablo: Yes, we started thinking on how to

252
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:45,568
do game a while ago and we decided to go

253
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:52,630
with this picture that explains how it

254
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,645
works.

255
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:57,683
Actually it's simple and you have four

256
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,659
pieces, the internal state, external

257
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,695
state, and in the middle you have the

258
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:08,733
sensory state and the active state.

259
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:12,773
So here is the mission.

260
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:16,814
You have some instructions that you can

261
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:20,855
read and would be fun if you go through

262
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,890
them and you can go either way.

263
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:30,952
And here we are going to go through the

264
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:35,005
sensory state where you're going to

265
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:41,061
listen to a music where some notes you

266
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:46,117
can censor that are not in the famous

267
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:49,145
song for Elise.

268
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:57,222
So you have to take notes and you can go

269
00:16:57,222 --> 00:17:03,220
and you can see that we are on the Markov

270
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,266
blanket which saw everything very

271
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:12,317
delineate as Dali would paint it.

272
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:19,380
And here is your active part of the game

273
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,434
where you have to do something which is

274
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:29,481
add the different notes that your

275
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:34,538
professor, music professor is telling you

276
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:40,591
don't miss because you probably on the

277
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:45,643
external state are trying to play the

278
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,660
music.

279
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:54,735
So you have to infer that you are missing

280
00:17:54,735 --> 00:18:01,746
some notes and go to the active state and

281
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:08,813
start walking through the right node.

282
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,860
If I miss the node, I just follow into

283
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,895
the nothing and come back into my

284
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,913
internal state.

285
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:23,962
So probably would have to go back and

286
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:24,979
sensor again.

287
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,005
And once I take the right actions and the

288
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:37,010
right nodes, I can go and solve the

289
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,011
puzzle.

290
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:44,017
And the idea here is to have a tool,

291
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:50,023
gaming tool to explain so you can

292
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:56,029
experience how this active inference on

293
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,032
free energy works.

294
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:04,031
And once you go to the end of that

295
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:08,035
adventure, which I'm not going to finish

296
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:12,039
because it's something that players

297
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,044
should do, you're going to have a door

298
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:21,048
where you have to put the sequence in low

299
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:26,053
case of what were the missing notes.

300
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:31,058
And it's going to allow you to come

301
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:35,062
inside the treasure room where you will

302
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:40,067
have feedback, feedback that you can send

303
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:45,072
us and we will be very happy to have it.

304
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:50,077
And then if you have a wallet, you will

305
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:53,080
be able to have digital asset.

306
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,085
If not, we will add information to help

307
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:02,083
people to go from web two to web three

308
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:06,087
and to get those digital assets.

309
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:11,092
And here to be developed would be future

310
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:16,097
adventures that I would be very happy to

311
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,098
do.

312
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:23,104
So this was pretty much the presentation

313
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:27,108
and hopefully we have new players in the

314
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,110
coming days.

315
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,113
Hope you have fun.

316
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:37,118
And I really encourage anyone to discover

317
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:41,122
and play with all these ideas and

318
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:46,127
thoughts and experiments and feelings

319
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:51,132
that I have the gut feeling that are

320
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:56,137
going to revolutionize how we understand

321
00:20:56,137 --> 00:21:01,136
the world and how we can improve in it by

322
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:05,140
reducing uncertainty.

323
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:09,144
So thank you and I don't know, Daniel, if

324
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:13,148
you have any comments or something in

325
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,150
this last ten minutes.

326
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,152
Daniel: Oh, yeah, we can definitely talk

327
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,153
for a few minutes.

328
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,155
I'm seeing many fun comments and

329
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,158
questions in the chat so people can post

330
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:23,158
it.

331
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,161
Yeah, the gameplay is smoother on even a

332
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,163
normal computer.

333
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,166
It may look choppy on the live stream,

334
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,169
but it's quite a nice playing experience.

335
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
.

336
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,172
Maybe just a little context like how did

337
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,175
you get into building these worlds or

338
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,177
what kind of tools are these?

339
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,181
And we obviously don't see them in today'

340
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,184
's mainstream educational and research

341
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,184
offerings.

342
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,188
But what could that even be to bring

343
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:57,192
together this kind of immersion and role

344
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,189
playing with education research?

345
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:09,198
Pablo: Yes, I we playing role games and

346
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:16,205
role games you have very diverse kind of

347
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,207
players.

348
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:24,213
So I was playing with guys like me, had a

349
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:29,218
struggle through the school and guys that

350
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:33,222
end up being researchers like yourself

351
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:38,227
because they were very good in those

352
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,229
environments.

353
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:47,236
For me, it was like we are sharing a lot

354
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:52,240
of cognitive values and information and

355
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,245
they are really having fun with me.

356
00:22:56,245 --> 00:23:02,245
So what the academia is telling me is not

357
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:08,251
what I'm feeling outside academia.

358
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:13,256
So that through the years it became more

359
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:18,261
and more clear that was one of the

360
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:23,266
drivers to have a very diverse kind of

361
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:27,270
friends and that one of the most

362
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,274
important things for me to learn.

363
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:35,278
It was having fun and to be a good

364
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,282
professional, I have to be enjoying what

365
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:42,285
I'm doing and to enjoy what I do, it has

366
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:46,289
to have that gamify feeling of it.

367
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:52,295
In 2021, I just went straight to explore

368
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:57,300
that road because Blockchains, what can

369
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,299
do is have a persistent sea of objects

370
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:06,303
and attributions to those objects and to

371
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:11,308
those wallets that you can add and build

372
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,310
on top of them.

373
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:17,314
It's like having a huge database for a

374
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:21,318
game purpose and then you figure out that

375
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:25,322
a game is kind of our organization.

376
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:28,325
So you need rules, you need to share

377
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:31,328
values, you need to have what we are

378
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:35,331
building now, which is the cecian cedo

379
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,335
which you agree with the players, what's

380
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,338
going to be about and how it's going to

381
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:42,339
work.

382
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,344
And we are building this fantastic

383
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:53,350
storytelling of how kind of world where

384
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,356
it was in the early 20s compared to what'

385
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:04,355
's happening now in this imaginary world

386
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:10,361
that's complementary to what's happening

387
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,363
in real life.

388
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:16,367
And we are just exploring those areas for

389
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,369
three years.

390
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:23,374
And once I got into the Institute, we

391
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:27,378
started serving these ideas.

392
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:31,382
You send us to do a system thinking

393
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:35,386
course that it was super cool.

394
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:40,391
We explore and learn and this document

395
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:44,395
that I can share, it was very important

396
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:48,399
for us to understand and we find out the

397
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,403
necessity to be able to compute what we

398
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:53,404
are doing.

399
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:59,410
So we start focusing more on ontology on

400
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,408
all the bricks that you need to

401
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:08,413
understand to build the skeleton of

402
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:13,418
something that could last for decades,

403
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:16,421
which is the idea.

404
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:19,424
And we are trying to build it so everyone

405
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:23,428
can copy, paste, fork it and do whatever

406
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,431
they want with the game, adapt it to

407
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:29,434
their own organizations and use it on

408
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,435
their favor.

409
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,439
And we are just exploring and having fun.

410
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
.

411
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,443
Daniel: That's awesome.

412
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:42,447
And there's so many pieces there.

413
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:46,451
It's true about the fun and the curiosity,

414
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:49,454
, those intrinsic motivations like being

415
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,457
6 hours deep into counting ants in the

416
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:55,460
desert or 5000 pipette pushes deep or

417
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,463
whatever it is in the trenches and in the

418
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,459
last mile.

419
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:06,465
And it can be easy to lose sight.

420
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:10,469
But when we lose sight and when we put

421
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:14,473
out the fire and the spark, it's a cold,

422
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:18,477
dark night, and no career or status or

423
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:22,481
extrinsic valuation is going to provide

424
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:26,485
simply the joy and the deeper meaning of

425
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:30,489
to two people going on a little adventure

426
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,492
running around this space, being inside

427
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:37,496
active inference rather than active

428
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,497
inference.

429
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,500
Being like this high speed train that's

430
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,501
leaving anyone behind or you're on the

431
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:45,503
outside and it's taking these twists and

432
00:27:45,503 --> 00:27:46,505
turns and you're getting thrown off.

433
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:51,510
It's like it is cool and air conditioned

434
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,514
in this space and people play and watch a

435
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:59,518
lot of games where they wield violent

436
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:03,516
arms and not even like saying whether

437
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,519
that's good or bad.

438
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,521
It's just it is a genre to want to have a

439
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,524
camera either in a character's head first

440
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,527
person perspective or a camera in a

441
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,529
second or a third person perspective,

442
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,532
which you can switch between here and

443
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,533
those kinds.

444
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,535
Of topics about egocentric versus

445
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,539
allocentric navigation and our ability to

446
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,542
have a perspective swap on ourself and be

447
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,545
able to take that kind of like out of

448
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,547
body situational awareness in real

449
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,550
spatial settings and just to be able to

450
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,553
cruise through this space and it's like,

451
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,557
yeah, there's no right way to boomerang.

452
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,559
You could go from external to sensory.

453
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,560
You could go here or there.

454
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,567
It's an appetizer and a fertilization

455
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,571
that we've really just never seen.

456
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,570
Pablo: Okay, yeah.

457
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,573
Thank you very much, Daniel, for this.

458
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,577
Daniel: Any last thoughts or comments?

459
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:15,582
Pablo: No, just enjoy while we are here,

460
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:18,585
which is, I think, our mission.

461
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:21,588
All right.

462
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:22,589
Daniel: Thank you, Pablo.

463
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:25,591
I'm sure everyone's going to really enjoy

464
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:27,594
this and let's also, of course, continue

465
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,596
to develop these games and continue to

466
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:32,599
offer these on ramps and have times where

467
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,601
we're meeting up in these spaces and

468
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,602
playing around.

469
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:38,605
Pablo: Thank you.

470
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:39,606
All right, bye.

471
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,607
Daniel: Farewell.

472
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:47,614
Pablo: All right.

473
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:53,620
Daniel: Welcome, Mahault.

474
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,621
This will be the.
