9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,880
All right.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:35,334
The next presentation is

11
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:38,982
with Pablo Fernandez Macchia. So welcome

12
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:44,618
back, Pablo. Hello here.

13
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:47,754
Okay, I did take us on an adventure of

14
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:51,166
curiosity. Yes. I'm going

15
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:53,406
to start sharing my screen. Let me know

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,440
if everything is all right.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,440
Should be perfect.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,780
Yes. Cool.

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,500
So this is one of my favorite memes and

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,220
probably most of you know it.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,880
This reference is

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,000
the cave of Platon and

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,450
to me it was kind of fine treated truth

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,370
that now with active inference

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,286
seems like we are closer to demonstrate.

26
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,200
That how it is.

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,454
So the first time

28
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:49,102
that I start act and

29
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,950
surf at the Institute,

30
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,386
this was kind of my feeling or my

31
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:02,434
face was looking into something

32
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,938
that it was complex,

33
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:08,870
scary and look

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,760
interesting. So I went

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,880
why I decided to go through it.

36
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,802
I envision a world where people is

37
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:26,682
driving by stronger incentives that

38
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,706
motivate them to reduce uncertainty in

39
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,160
the systems they are part of.

40
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,510
My approach is through games which are

41
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,246
going to go later. But I really on this

42
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,486
talk, want to encourage all kinds

43
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,690
of persons or people that are

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,754
curious. And I want them to act

45
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,780
and get involved in the community.

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,630
Because you may find that for now most

47
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,550
of the actors are

48
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,954
scientists and very well on reputed

49
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,954
people. And you might think that you are

50
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:12,778
not a part of it,

51
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,722
but very far away from that.

52
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:19,270
The Institute. Encourage the opposite.

53
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,926
So I'm super glad to have

54
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:25,374
been through this journey and I wanted

55
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:27,162
to share a little bit of my background

56
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:29,520
and then we go to the game.

57
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,706
Here is the second and last meme. The

58
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,266
world you were raised to survive is no

59
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:40,942
longer exist. We are on digital

60
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:43,950
revolution and with this digital

61
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,920
revolution it comes a bunch of different

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,130
things that are evolving and hopefully

63
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,022
bring us to a better world. Okay,

64
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,854
who I am? I'm Pablo. My name is Pablo.

65
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:03,562
But more defined or what

66
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,754
best define me is my action and my

67
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:06,890
experiences.

68
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,390
I think role gameplays and sports

69
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,022
movies are super important and as a kid

70
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:24,350
I was dyslexic

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,066
and the system didn't fill my

72
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:32,274
necessities. So I really hated school.

73
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,750
But I love learning and it's something

74
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,742
that I've been doing all my life. And

75
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:42,614
it's curious how a system that is

76
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:48,234
designed to give you knowledge and to

77
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,922
help you with the learning, in my case

78
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,860
it didn't work at all.

79
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,020
That's a little starting point.

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,134
I believe in the copy transformation and

81
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:08,110
combine of things and on my adulthood

82
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,170
everything shifted and I became

83
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,378
successful, professional and

84
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:20,770
I love it.

85
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,578
Teams. What I do for a

86
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:28,754
living is product manager and

87
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:32,422
what I do on my pet projects site

88
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:35,954
projects, call it as you want is related

89
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:40,010
to gaming and gamifying

90
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,010
organizations and experiences.

91
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,086
Nowadays I trust more my intuition which

92
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:53,370
is something that it really was broken

93
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,478
during my childhood and you will see a

94
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:59,454
little bit more about that. Here are

95
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,200
some things of my interest.

96
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,666
Licenses like open science which

97
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:08,318
is the case of the Institute philosophy

98
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:10,274
that's the first meme education,

99
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:12,660
governance, family, art,

100
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,630
love, communication, technology and

101
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,806
nature and a bunch of other things that

102
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:23,720
I will be happy to share any other time.

103
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,934
One of the questions that Daniel asked

104
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:30,710
me for this talk is what was exciting

105
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,346
for me about all this,

106
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,020
what right? And for me,

107
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,446
when I give talks, I like to share a

108
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,366
view of the last hundred years and

109
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:49,806
the Industrial revolution and how the

110
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:53,090
ones that were on this world before us

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,954
did something right. I'm sure that we

112
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:59,890
all know big mistakes or

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,042
big things that have failed or

114
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:06,278
that could be better through

115
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:10,360
iterations. But on data

116
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,150
it's very promising and

117
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,534
very good. I think it's inspiring

118
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:21,594
to have the basic education,

119
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:24,842
how it grows, the vaccination, what it

120
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:28,554
did for us, democracy and

121
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:32,058
how poverty dropped draxily,

122
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:36,158
how literacy it grew and

123
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:39,406
because all these things, child

124
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:42,914
mortality just went very

125
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:46,786
low. So basically

126
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:50,930
the future of education is what makes

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,610
me be excited.

128
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,858
How I ended up on this ecosystem.

129
00:07:58,034 --> 00:08:01,286
It's super random and I'm going to

130
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:04,614
explain it in hopefully two to

131
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:08,662
five minutes. I as a product manager

132
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,500
and very interested on technology.

133
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,866
I heard about Blockchains back in

134
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:19,306
2015 and I didn't understood anything at

135
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:23,302
all. And then back in 2017

136
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:27,966
I heard about a I didn't start them,

137
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:31,680
did not play that game. But it was

138
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,482
raising a fun thing to consider,

139
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,874
which is digital assets and ownership of

140
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,410
those digital assets.

141
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,774
For now, we didn't have a technology

142
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:50,214
that could scale and that was good

143
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:54,130
enough to ensure that the digital assets

144
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,490
that you own were you yours and you

145
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,410
had the freedom of transaction on them.

146
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,834
I did understand that very fast and

147
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:09,034
because I'm a game player and as a game

148
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,854
player you always have your different

149
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,374
assets and do things with them. And as

150
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:19,520
well, I have been collecting music

151
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,050
and all kind of digital

152
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,674
assets. I bought this very

153
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:32,658
famous collection of punks and

154
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:35,798
sold them very fast before I could be a

155
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:39,606
millionaire. But due to in 2021

156
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,382
I decided that I wanted to build

157
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:45,270
something. And then back then I went

158
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,602
through this beautiful project that was

159
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:52,522
the first art saw on Ethereum, which one

160
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:56,342
of the artists it was Daniel Friedman.

161
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:59,974
So I, as a curious person and

162
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,934
person that has been working with

163
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:05,214
artists, I always like to know what is

164
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:08,174
the driver of those artists, what they

165
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:11,774
do, and try to get in

166
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,474
their walls, to understand better and

167
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:18,820
to get as much information as I can

168
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,326
before I decide to encourage

169
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:27,000
or collect or just

170
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,158
always deeper on music or

171
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:35,174
art. For me, is very nice

172
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:39,574
thing to do. So I discovered these cards

173
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:43,114
and education was

174
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:46,742
one of them. And I went through Flickr

175
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:50,542
which is where it was the first at least

176
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,790
that I found place where it was.

177
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,746
And the license. It was Creative Commons

178
00:10:56,778 --> 00:11:00,846
license of not commercial use but it

179
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:05,442
was an open license which I been part

180
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:09,426
of Creative Commons community for a very

181
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:13,394
long time since I was working with

182
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,846
musicians and I think it's one of the

183
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,222
best things that happened to the

184
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,790
internet. These are

185
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,886
some of the pragmatic things that the

186
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:28,458
audience cares about. Hopefully we will

187
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:32,010
have some of these on our games.

188
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,460
AI for sure is going to be there.

189
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,454
Free energy principle is going to be one

190
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,838
of the things that hopefully we help

191
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:49,006
to minimize and to make

192
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:52,554
it funnier. Games or happier games and

193
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,442
games that help organizations to be

194
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:59,010
better. The human factor,

195
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,442
it's super important for me. And

196
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:04,386
implementation and action I learned by

197
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:07,350
doing and it's one of the values that

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,318
the Institute encouraged more. So I just

199
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:13,526
jump on things and try to understand

200
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:16,902
them through doing and sharing as

201
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:20,394
I'm doing now. Here are the

202
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:24,810
epistemics and collective

203
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,154
is one of them that I'm as well.

204
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:32,160
Super interest agents,

205
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,840
of course,

206
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,766
practical and curiosity which is the

207
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:42,478
adventure that I have the feeling that

208
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:45,794
I'm being involved all my life and that

209
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,394
I encourage always my two

210
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:53,490
girls to be curious and to open

211
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,110
things and look behind the doors and

212
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,386
just be an active. Here are some values

213
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:02,374
that I like to point which are

214
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:05,170
exploration, the culture of curiosity

215
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,000
that I did mention a lot.

216
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,842
Continuous learning because that

217
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:16,186
experience on the school. I think I

218
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,566
just keep going and keep going and it's

219
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:22,570
something that sometimes bad experiences

220
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,150
could turn out in good habits.

221
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,360
Learning by doing, as I already told.

222
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,290
Integrity and inclusivity. Honesty,

223
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,994
accountability, a big one. Trying to be

224
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:41,540
professional on everything that you do.

225
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,022
For me, I started as human being.

226
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,270
Curious people

227
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,734
of all backgrounds and perspectives are

228
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:55,590
welcome to the Institute.

229
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,138
I would be very happy to be the link and

230
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:04,026
to speak with someone

231
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:07,770
that has doubts or if I couldn't help.

232
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,738
I think I could help on the very early

233
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:13,034
stage. If you're not very technical

234
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:20,046
person, I think I could help. There we

235
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,682
are learning by doing. I would love to

236
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:27,010
everyone that's on the stream,

237
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,826
I'm going to share this link which is a

238
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,626
new game that we are testing and I'm

239
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,560
excited to share it with you.

240
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,158
It's the adventure of Curiosity and here

241
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:49,910
Daniel. I'm going to copy and paste

242
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,154
the link. It would be awesome.

243
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:56,122
Okay. There's a tiny typo on your

244
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:58,730
slides. It just ends with a curiosity.

245
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,326
Thank you. But I'm going to paste it

246
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,230
into the YouTube live chat.

247
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,850
Okay, thank you. Yeah, I told you I'm

248
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,990
a Dyslexic. I have all kind of titles

249
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,434
throughout my life. Sorry for that. I

250
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:22,946
always try to improve share

251
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,506
the. Yeah, I put it in the YouTube chat

252
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:26,918
so people can head over there. All

253
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,246
right, yeah. Could you tell us about

254
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,990
this platform? And this is the first

255
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,240
active game?

256
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,282
Yes, we started

257
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,826
thinking on how to do game a

258
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:44,780
while ago and we decided to go

259
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,586
with this picture

260
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,320
that explains how it works. Actually

261
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,702
it's simple and you have four

262
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,178
pieces, the internal state, external

263
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:04,754
state, and in the middle you have

264
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:08,340
the sensory state and the active state.

265
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,334
So here is the mission.

266
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:15,974
You have some instructions that you can

267
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:20,022
read and would be fun if you go

268
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:23,382
through them and you can go either

269
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:26,614
way. And here we are going to go through

270
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,754
the sensory state where you're going to

271
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:37,996
listen to a music where

272
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:43,380
some notes you can censor

273
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,600
that are not in the famous song

274
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,600
for Elise.

275
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,604
So you have to take

276
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:59,270
notes and

277
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,036
you can go and you can see that we are

278
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,424
on the Markov blanket which saw

279
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:11,380
everything very delineate as Dali

280
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,144
would paint it. And here is your

281
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:18,744
active part of the game where

282
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:26,076
you have to do something which is add

283
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,950
the different notes that your

284
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,204
professor, music professor is telling

285
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:38,320
you don't miss because you probably on

286
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,840
the external

287
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,324
state are trying to play

288
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:50,400
the music. So you have to infer

289
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,070
that you are missing some notes and

290
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,224
go to the

291
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:06,372
active state and start walking

292
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:09,624
through the right node. If I

293
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:14,332
miss the node, I just follow into

294
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,084
the nothing and come back into my

295
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:21,432
internal state. So probably

296
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:24,930
would have to go back and sensor again.

297
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,520
And once I take the right actions

298
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,780
and the right nodes, I can go and

299
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,676
solve the puzzle. And the

300
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,430
idea here is to have a tool,

301
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,770
gaming tool to explain

302
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:54,490
so you can experience how this

303
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,996
active inference on free energy works.

304
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:04,812
And once you go

305
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:10,040
to the end of that adventure,

306
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,992
which I'm not going to finish because

307
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,816
it's something that players should do,

308
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:18,016
you're going to have a door where you

309
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,424
have to put the sequence in low

310
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:24,820
case of

311
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,696
what were the missing notes. And it's

312
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:31,044
going to allow you to come inside the

313
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,630
treasure room where you

314
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,280
will have feedback,

315
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,248
feedback that you can send us and we

316
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:47,048
will be very happy to have it. And then

317
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:49,400
if you have a wallet,

318
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,832
you will be able to have digital asset.

319
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:57,772
If not, we will add information to

320
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:01,872
help people to go from web two

321
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:05,180
to web three and to get those digital

322
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,736
assets. And here

323
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:11,744
to be developed would be future

324
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:15,430
adventures that I would be very happy to

325
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,924
do. So this

326
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:23,190
was pretty much the presentation and

327
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,560
hopefully we have new players

328
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,544
in the coming days. Hope you have

329
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:34,900
fun. And I really encourage

330
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,580
anyone to discover and

331
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,550
play with all these ideas and

332
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,152
thoughts and experiments and feelings

333
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:52,064
that I have the gut feeling that are

334
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:55,570
going to revolutionize how we understand

335
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,056
the world and how we can

336
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:05,460
improve in it by reducing uncertainty.

337
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,748
So thank you and I

338
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:11,444
don't know, Daniel, if you have any

339
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,804
comments or something in this last ten

340
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:17,332
minutes. Oh, yeah, we can definitely

341
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,848
talk for a few minutes. I'm seeing many

342
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:21,764
fun comments and questions in the chat

343
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:24,056
so people can post it. Yeah, the

344
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:27,620
gameplay is smoother on even a normal

345
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,604
computer. It may look choppy on the live

346
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:33,864
stream, but it's quite a nice playing

347
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:36,872
experience. Maybe just a little context

348
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:39,932
like how did you get into building these

349
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:42,848
worlds or what kind of tools are these?

350
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:46,128
And we obviously don't see them in

351
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,912
today's mainstream educational and

352
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:51,584
research offerings. But what could that

353
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:54,740
even be to bring together this kind of

354
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,688
immersion and role playing

355
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:00,950
with education research?

356
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,110
Yes, I we

357
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,816
playing role games and role games you

358
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:17,384
have very diverse kind

359
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:21,230
of players. So I was playing with

360
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,070
guys like me,

361
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,940
had a struggle through the school and

362
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,660
guys that end up being researchers

363
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,424
like yourself because they were very

364
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:40,640
good in those environments.

365
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,660
For me, it was like we are sharing a lot

366
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,144
of cognitive values

367
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,612
and information and they are really

368
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:59,272
having fun with me. So what

369
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:02,936
the academia is telling me is not

370
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,208
what I'm feeling outside

371
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:11,244
academia. So that through

372
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:14,764
the years it became more and

373
00:23:14,802 --> 00:23:18,808
more clear that was one of the drivers

374
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:22,530
to have a very diverse kind of friends

375
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,296
and that one of the most important

376
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:32,768
things for me to learn. It was having

377
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:36,164
fun and to be a good

378
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:39,716
professional, I have to be enjoying what

379
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:43,140
I'm doing and to enjoy what I do, it has

380
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,550
to have that gamify feeling of it.

381
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,690
In 2021, I just went

382
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,208
straight to explore that road because

383
00:23:57,374 --> 00:24:01,036
Blockchains, what can do is have a

384
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:05,630
persistent sea of objects and

385
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,404
attributions to those objects and to

386
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:12,832
those wallets that you can add and build

387
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,890
on top of them. It's like having a huge

388
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,400
database for a game purpose and

389
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,664
then you figure out that a game is kind

390
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:26,852
of our organization. So you need

391
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:28,916
rules, you need to share values, you

392
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:32,596
need to have what we

393
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:36,288
are building now, which is the cecian

394
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:39,700
cedo which you agree with the players,

395
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,796
what's going to be about and how it's

396
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:46,410
going to work. And we are building

397
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,464
this fantastic storytelling

398
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:55,324
of how kind of

399
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,404
world where it was in the early

400
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:03,744
20s compared to what's happening now

401
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:08,240
in this imaginary world that's

402
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,936
complementary to what's happening in

403
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:15,792
real life. And we are just exploring

404
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:19,988
those areas for three years. And once

405
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:23,956
I got into the

406
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:26,824
Institute, we started serving these

407
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:30,360
ideas. You send us to do

408
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,512
a system thinking course that it was

409
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,530
super cool.

410
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,432
We explore and learn and this document

411
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:44,684
that I can share, it was very important

412
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:48,540
for us to understand and we find

413
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,568
out the necessity to be able to compute

414
00:25:52,744 --> 00:25:55,036
what we are doing. So we start focusing

415
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:59,504
more on ontology on all

416
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:03,472
the bricks that you need to

417
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:07,636
understand to build the

418
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:11,604
skeleton of something that could last

419
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:15,110
for decades, which is

420
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,264
the idea. And we are trying to build it

421
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:21,652
so everyone can copy, paste,

422
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:24,376
fork it and do whatever they want with

423
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,200
the game, adapt it to their own

424
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,724
organizations and use it on

425
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:33,304
their favor. And we are just exploring

426
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,670
and having fun.

427
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,528
That's awesome. And there's so

428
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:44,304
many pieces there. It's true about the

429
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:46,716
fun and the curiosity, those intrinsic

430
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:51,088
motivations like being 6 hours deep into

431
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:53,600
counting ants in the desert or 5000

432
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,916
pipette pushes deep or whatever it

433
00:26:56,938 --> 00:27:00,000
is in the trenches and in the last mile.

434
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,212
And it

435
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,816
can be easy to lose sight. But when

436
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,344
we lose sight and when we put out the

437
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:13,652
fire and the spark, it's a cold,

438
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:17,000
dark night, and no

439
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,692
career or status or extrinsic

440
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:24,916
valuation is going to provide simply

441
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:29,108
the joy and the deeper meaning

442
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:32,416
of to two people going on

443
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:34,144
a little adventure running around this

444
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:37,692
space, being inside active inference

445
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,504
rather than active inference. Being like

446
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,564
this high speed train that's leaving

447
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:44,260
anyone behind or you're on the outside

448
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,616
and it's taking these twists and turns

449
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:47,988
and you're getting thrown off. It's like

450
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:52,404
it is cool and air conditioned in this

451
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:56,310
space and people

452
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,992
play and watch a lot of games where they

453
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,816
wield violent arms and not

454
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:05,784
even like saying whether that's good or

455
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:08,696
bad. It's just it is a genre to want to

456
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:11,304
have a camera either in a character's

457
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:14,636
head first person perspective or a

458
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:16,460
camera in a second or a third person

459
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,704
perspective, which you can switch

460
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:21,240
between here and those kinds. Of topics

461
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,724
about egocentric versus allocentric

462
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:27,360
navigation and our ability to have a

463
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,464
perspective swap on ourself and be

464
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,624
able to take that kind of like out of

465
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:35,916
body situational awareness in

466
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:39,188
real spatial settings and just to be

467
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:41,412
able to cruise through this space and

468
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,396
it's like, yeah, there's no right way to

469
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:46,004
boomerang. You could go from external to

470
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:48,010
sensory. You could go here or there.

471
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,456
It's an appetizer and a

472
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:56,872
fertilization that we've really just

473
00:28:56,926 --> 00:28:58,330
never seen.

474
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,300
Okay, yeah. Thank you very much,

475
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,110
Daniel, for this.

476
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,088
Any last thoughts or comments? No,

477
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:15,810
just enjoy while we are here, which is,

478
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,400
I think, our mission.

479
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,992
All right. Thank you, Pablo. I'm sure

480
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,336
everyone's going to really enjoy this

481
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:27,936
and let's also, of course, continue to

482
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:30,064
develop these games and continue to

483
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,992
offer these on ramps and have times

484
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,684
where we're meeting up in these spaces

485
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:38,392
and playing around. Thank you.

486
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:40,600
All right, bye. Farewell.

487
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,230
All right.
