1
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:18,972
Daniel: Next up -

2
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,105
Welcome Avel.

3
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:23,441
We have Avel Guénin-Carlut with “Embedded

4
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,544
normativity.”

5
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,757
So thanks Avel to you.

6
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:31,275
Avel: Hello.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,374
Can you hear me?

8
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:33,463
Daniel: Yep.

9
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:41,210
Avel: And can you see the slides?

10
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:43,489
Daniel: I only see the top left of the

11
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:44,530
slide.

12
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:49,082
Avel: You only see the top just yeah.

13
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,141
Daniel: Try again.

14
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:51,222
Thank you.

15
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:54,578
Avel: Okay, about now?

16
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,625
Daniel: Yep.

17
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:55,686
Looks great.

18
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:56,776
Thank you.

19
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:58,968
Avel: Okay, good.

20
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:01,662
So I am Avelina Carlo.

21
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:04,922
I'm interested in multiscale collective

22
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:05,009
organization.

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,264
This is why I came to active in France to

24
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:08,335
begin with.

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,640
And the core question I've been asking is

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,836
basically when we look at human

27
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:16,103
organization, there is creative evolution,

28
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,350
, there is a change through time of the

29
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,585
specific patterns that are enacted.

30
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:23,850
And this is very hard to account for.

31
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,087
And I have been trying to pin down more

32
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,297
and more specifically what exactly is

33
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,474
going on and how to model it.

34
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,766
So this specific work is a work I wrote

35
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,952
in the context of my PhD.

36
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:37,282
Of course, which is funded by the Escape

37
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:40,535
Project, a project in cognitive

38
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,861
archaeology that's interested in how the

39
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:46,018
archaeological landscape shape cognition

40
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,034
and vice versa.

41
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:51,060
The title of it is automated.

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,066
No activity.

43
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,089
An active inference of agency.

44
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:57,121
An active inference account of agency

45
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,147
being flesh because you will see very

46
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,097
quickly why.

47
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,125
So first we will go through the existing

48
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,149
work on anchor cognition in the context

49
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,162
of active inference.

50
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:09,188
Then we'll try to expose the concept of

51
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:12,212
embedded Motivity, which we introduce

52
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,228
here and what it means.

53
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,257
And then we'll look at the more semiotic

54
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:19,284
question around the externalization and

55
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:22,311
utilization of normativity in cultural

56
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,321
landscapes.

57
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:26,351
So first encouraged cognition in active

58
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:26,358
in France.

59
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:29,384
So we know active inference.

60
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:31,400
I will go quickly over it.

61
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,424
I still need to do it because there are

62
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,443
lookers that are not familiar.

63
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,476
So active inference say that agents

64
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:42,510
continuously predict the specific queues

65
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,540
sensory cues they will see, and they

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,572
predict the action or policy they will

67
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:49,583
not take.

68
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:52,614
And they basically enact an ongoing

69
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,640
stream of expectation that they

70
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,670
reconstruct given upcoming signal.

71
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:01,643
So this is best Akotin four in this

72
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:04,671
schema which shows the agent as the

73
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:07,700
nickel system, which engage through

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,724
environment, through action and

75
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:10,737
cessations.

76
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:14,776
And all of these specific domains, they

77
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:18,810
minimize a specific function that is

78
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,850
called free energy and whose minimization

79
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,887
basically means there is a prerogative

80
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:27,907
process going on.

81
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,941
And a core property of active inference

82
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:33,964
is that it dissolves agency as we

83
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,982
typically understand it.

84
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,007
We don't have agents that have like an

85
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:40,031
internal monologue that drives them to

86
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,041
take decision.

87
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,065
We have a conscious anticipation of what'

88
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,071
's going on.

89
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:47,100
And whatever an agent anticipates itself

90
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,114
to do, it will do.

91
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:51,146
And so this goes for computationally

92
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:54,177
satisfying but very deflationary notion

93
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:57,203
of what is going on with agency.

94
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:01,184
So the question then comes what is the

95
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,209
relation between an agent and the

96
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,242
cognitive landscape in which it evolves?

97
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,279
I will present very rapidly again the

98
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,309
framework of Skill and a pioneered by

99
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:17,340
Brunborg, Kierstein and Reidfield, and

100
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,371
which says that Skill agents, which we

101
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:23,404
understand as agents that understand what

102
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:26,432
is going on around them, they will

103
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,460
basically experience the world as a

104
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,488
landscape of affordances, which is

105
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:34,517
opportunities for actions and their

106
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:37,546
cognition pretty much reduces to the

107
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:41,579
experience of this landscape and adaptive

108
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,608
engagement with it, which basically

109
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,638
maximize the grip the agent has on the

110
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:49,669
system and essentially for reasons we

111
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,699
will not go over because it's math the

112
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,726
very existence experience of this

113
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:57,747
landscape.

114
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,710
It is equivalent to the existence of

115
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,725
constraints over attention.

116
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,755
The attention that the agent gives to

117
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,781
thing which translates the embodied

118
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,811
expectation that are two times embodied

119
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,839
bad the embodied expectation that the

120
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,852
agent enacts.

121
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,886
And so this becomes very interesting when

122
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,908
we cross it with the existence of

123
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:22,935
enculturation in humans because the basic

124
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,960
experience we have of affordances, of

125
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,986
what we can do it is shaped culturally,

126
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:30,011
it is shaped by interaction wherein we

127
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,038
learn with other humans about what we do,

128
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,066
what we can do and what we can do.

129
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,093
And this means that the basic human

130
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:41,123
experience, it's thoroughly encultured.

131
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,158
It's embedded in what Ramshed called

132
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:48,196
landscape of cultural fondencies and it

133
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:52,230
is embedded in cultural and material

134
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,264
regimes of attention so ways to pay

135
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,287
attention to things.

136
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,258
And this is a figure that comes, I

137
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:03,283
believe, from this year on thinking

138
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,308
throughout the minds where it shows

139
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:08,335
basically how the action installation

140
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,342
cycle.

141
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:12,372
When we have several agents, they build a

142
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,398
common environment that has epistemic

143
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:17,427
cues on how the world is like and we are

144
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,454
enculturated to pay attention to things

145
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:23,483
in a certain manner that makes it so.

146
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,517
We perceive and enact this landscape and

147
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:29,548
so the uncultured constraint over the

148
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:33,581
flow of attention because of what we saw

149
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:36,613
just before the deflationary account of

150
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:37,622
agency.

151
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,648
It means that the very expensive

152
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,677
landscape, cultural landscape that is

153
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:45,705
collectively enacted, it effectively

154
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,736
integrates intentionality, it effectively

155
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,764
integrates normativity in a way that

156
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,794
clashes strongly with classical account

157
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:55,805
of both.

158
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:00,792
So, given this state of the art, let us

159
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,822
look at what I mean specifically by

160
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,842
embedded normativity.

161
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:08,875
So embedded Motivity is a kind of

162
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,910
normativity, I think you have got it.

163
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:15,940
So normativity it means basically the

164
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,969
criterions by which we judge things to be

165
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,998
good and bad in the context of biological

166
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,028
system they will look for specific, I don'

167
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,056
't know, chemical concentration and they

168
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:29,083
will avoid other this is the phenomenon

169
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,111
of chemotaxis, this is pretty basic and

170
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,135
this is a form of normativity.

171
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:37,169
But for humans we will typically think of

172
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,199
laws, cultural norms, culturally shared

173
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,230
way to judge behavior and again, at least

174
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,260
in the context of law and choice theory

175
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,291
we typically think there is an agent, he

176
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,322
has access to information and will think

177
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,339
what should I do?

178
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,367
And he will judge rationally about what

179
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,332
is good and what is bad based on a

180
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:02,358
collection of values which are internal

181
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,370
to the agent.

182
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,388
This is not how it works.

183
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,438
What I call embodied Motivity is by

184
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:14,471
contrast regimes of normal activity where

185
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:17,503
it is the norms and value that guide the

186
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,519
agent's behavior.

187
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:20,537
It is embedded in the material and

188
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:21,548
cultural environment.

189
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,575
So basically the agent projects a

190
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,606
specific set of norms and value in the

191
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:30,638
very experienced fitness environment and

192
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:34,671
it will perceive the locus of normativity

193
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,702
as the environment and not as a form of

194
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,721
internal judgment.

195
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:44,775
Let us look at what can exactly how

196
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,794
embedded Motivity work.

197
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:48,812
It will be more concrete.

198
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,844
So first we can materially constrain

199
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,861
people to do things.

200
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,884
So for example, there are roads, you can

201
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,906
go off roads but it's harder and you can'

202
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,928
't really do that if you are a chariot.

203
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,896
So when you have a specific pattern of

204
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:05,924
roads which is constructed by cities you

205
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:08,953
are pretty much constrained to follow the

206
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,979
roads materially and for this we will

207
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:13,008
talk of structural embedding and there is

208
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:16,036
another regimes of mezzanomativity where

209
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:19,059
we build on environments that will

210
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,083
basically cue you suggest you into

211
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,109
adopting specific norms and specific

212
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,120
values.

213
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:28,152
For example, Escape thinks that vertical

214
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:31,181
patterns in archaeological culture they

215
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:33,209
are somehow embedded within what we'd

216
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,226
call vertical norms.

217
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,252
So hierarchy and certification in social

218
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,278
relationship and for this specific form

219
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,301
of embedding we can talk of semantic

220
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,310
embedding.

221
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:48,349
What must be very clear is that we don't

222
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,378
have structural embedding on one side and

223
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,405
semantic embedding there are basically

224
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,434
two mechanism, complementary mechanism in

225
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,460
which embedded normativity occurs.

226
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,438
If we look at city so this is impression

227
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:06,472
of sumerian culture city states we have

228
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,508
matter organization that prompts specific

229
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,526
kind of behavior.

230
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,552
So for example, we have a bridge and this

231
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:16,573
bridge allow you constrain you to go

232
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,596
through the river in a specific way if

233
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:19,607
you are on foot.

234
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,639
But these material constraints it is

235
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,648
perceivable.

236
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,672
So by seeing the bridge you will also see

237
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,694
that you can navigate the world in this

238
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,702
specific way.

239
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:31,722
So you don't have a sparration between

240
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:32,739
semantic and structural embedding.

241
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:35,766
We just have two ways in which

242
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,799
constraints of our behavior that are

243
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,832
embedded in the environment work, and

244
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:45,869
something that is core to the account of

245
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:49,905
embedded non activity is, again, that it

246
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,924
is not internal.

247
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:54,950
But we need to go into more detail about

248
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,972
what we mean by not being internal,

249
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:58,997
because, of course, we're talking about

250
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,964
agency agents constrain what agents do.

251
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:08,030
It's not outside what it is is embedded.

252
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,055
In Motivity is a regime of the multivity

253
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:13,081
where the norms and value, they stem from

254
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:14,099
the experience of Fordance.

255
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,135
For example, if I see fire I will not

256
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:22,171
think about hey, could I put my hand in

257
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:24,196
it and get my hand burn?

258
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:26,217
I think it would be painful.

259
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,230
I won't do that.

260
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:30,256
If I even think about putting my hand in

261
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,280
the fire I will immediately feel bad.

262
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:35,305
The normativity it's embedded in my

263
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,321
experience of the world.

264
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:40,357
I feel like the fire or more specifically

265
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,389
the possibility of putting my hand in the

266
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,410
fire is intrinsically bad.

267
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,440
I do not feel there is a possibility that

268
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,468
is neutral and then I judge to be bad.

269
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,507
But of course this judgment does not

270
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,544
occur outside even if I feel like it's

271
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,507
about my affordances.

272
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,532
It emerges from the engagement I have

273
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,556
with the material and cultural niche in

274
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,570
which I find myself.

275
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,608
And if we want to untangle what this

276
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:15,640
means precisely we will have to go into

277
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,665
more detail into what I call the

278
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:20,697
externalization internalization of many

279
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,710
normativity.

280
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:25,742
So let us look at something very simple

281
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,772
how normativity work for embodied agents.

282
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:28,773
.

283
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,812
So embodied agents, they do things

284
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:36,851
hopefully in a niche that is material and

285
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:40,890
this niche will be marked by the activity

286
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,905
of my agent.

287
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:43,929
And these marks, they can then act as

288
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,954
constraints either through structural or

289
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:48,976
cementing embedding in the agent's

290
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,001
firmament because they basically signify

291
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,027
that in the past I wanted to do that.

292
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:55,047
Maybe doing that is good.

293
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:59,084
For example, we have centuries with I don'

294
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,055
't know if centuries English word but web

295
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:05,084
path if animals that have legs this is

296
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,111
actually important walk on a specific

297
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:11,141
path, they will compact the earth and it

298
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:14,170
will become improper to grow anything,

299
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,181
even grass.

300
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:18,217
And you will have paths that will emerge

301
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:22,252
that are pretty neat, it's pretty visible

302
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,283
and that tell you hey, not only this

303
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:28,318
earth is compact and allow you to walk on

304
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:32,352
it without effort but also this has been

305
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:35,384
widely judged to be a good outline for

306
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:39,423
navigation in this specific environment.

307
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:42,449
So the very experience of a path

308
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,475
basically invites you you perceive the

309
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,501
affordance of walking through the path

310
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,525
and this is something that again can

311
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:52,553
result from your own activity that can be

312
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:54,577
written into development by your own

313
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:55,587
activity.

314
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,571
And so this begs the question of how okay,

315
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,598
, there exists embedded nomativity but

316
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:04,617
how do we embed nomativity?

317
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:06,636
What is the activity of embedding

318
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:07,645
mativity like?

319
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,678
And the word I will use for that is

320
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:12,691
externalization.

321
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:14,716
We perceive the world because we

322
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,746
externalize specific causes of sensation

323
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:20,778
into an imagined objective external world.

324
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:20,779
.

325
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:25,823
So when we see the path, we see a path.

326
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,855
We do not see compact earth that we then

327
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,885
compute to mean that other things have

328
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:32,896
worked on it.

329
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,917
We just see hey, there is a path.

330
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,946
And this is because we have externalized

331
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,971
a specific cognitive kind which is the

332
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:40,976
path.

333
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:45,025
And this is argument that several people

334
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,057
made here lene Steiner, which if I

335
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:52,094
remember well, worked on the production

336
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:56,130
of devices that help blind people see

337
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,165
things through, I believe an array of

338
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:03,145
repetitive device on their shoulder.

339
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:06,173
So the core argument they make is that if

340
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,196
you give people that they will start

341
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:11,222
seeing things, they will start perceiving

342
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,246
things as being before them rather than

343
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,272
having vibration on the shoulder and then

344
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:18,296
thinking about what does it mean.

345
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:21,324
And so the basic argument is that

346
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:24,355
perception is just picture of what cause

347
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:27,386
we infer, what is the structure we infer

348
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,418
of our environment given the existence of

349
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:33,448
a specific coupling device that relates

350
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:37,480
action to sensation and vice versa.

351
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,518
And this critically relies on the

352
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,545
internalization of specific.

353
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,565
We could say a lot of things that I will

354
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,585
say priors specific, priors knowledge and

355
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,591
perception.

356
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:51,621
So me seeing the path as a path relies on

357
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,648
me having the prior knowledge that there

358
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,675
is such a thing as paths and I should be

359
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,697
expecting to see them around.

360
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,668
And so you have duality of

361
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:04,697
externalization and internalization in

362
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,726
the production of embedded mativity.

363
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,754
I can only see norms out there if I've

364
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:12,779
internalized integrated a specific

365
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,808
apparatus of perception that entails that

366
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,835
there are indeed those specific norms

367
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:21,860
that are embedded in those specific

368
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,872
affordances.

369
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,905
And so this produce a more general

370
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,932
question of semantics, particularly of

371
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:29,947
information theory.

372
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,978
How do reading and writing and reading

373
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,989
maturity works?

374
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:38,030
So when I extend lies I treat the world

375
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,056
as having specific natural categories

376
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:43,084
that I pretty much imagine and I can use

377
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,107
them because I imagine them as an

378
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:48,135
extended memory that allow me to read and

379
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,154
write normative cues.

380
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:54,197
This can be letters, pure signs.

381
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,218
But as far as I'm concerned here, all

382
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:59,241
signs are at least implicitly normative.

383
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:01,206
There about how you should interpret the

384
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:01,209
sign.

385
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:06,258
And this means that we can experience

386
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:11,300
specific landscape of forensics and we

387
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,332
can write things out there.

388
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,355
We can write normative cues, bio behavior

389
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:18,378
that will then constrain further behavior.

390
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:18,379
.

391
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,422
But nothing tells us that we can

392
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,456
communicate through this.

393
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,479
The communication, it works because of

394
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,497
the internalization of prayers.

395
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:33,525
If a given community of agents have

396
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:36,554
internalized a specific set of prayers

397
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:39,582
that is, a set of prayers that enable

398
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:42,612
externalization of numerative cues, then

399
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:45,643
only it can use the environment as a way

400
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,660
to write and read.

401
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:51,702
Normative queues as embedded normativity

402
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,709
thing.

403
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:55,742
And this communication, it can be read in

404
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,760
terms of information theory.

405
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,775
Of course it can be read in terms of

406
00:17:58,775 --> 00:17:59,780
semantics.

407
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,755
But what is critical to analyze that the

408
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,786
process of internalization there is no

409
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,820
trust system there is no private key that

410
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,851
allow you to be sure that the way you

411
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,883
internalize norms is very specifically

412
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,915
the way in which the Emily Mativity was

413
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,941
encouraged to begin with.

414
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,971
There is a loss, or there is ambiguity,

415
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,000
or there is I'd rather say it like this

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,002
an active demarch of reconstruction, of

417
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:32,005
given prayers by the agent.

418
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:35,008
And so this gap between the intent of

419
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,010
other communicants and my intent, my

420
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,013
understanding of what they meant by their

421
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,016
active engagement with the world, it

422
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:46,018
builds a tiny gap in information that is

423
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,021
somehow enough to drive the open ended

424
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:51,024
evolution of cultural landscape.

425
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,026
And this is something that I do not think

426
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,029
is embedded in active in France and I

427
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,031
think is of major interest to research,

428
00:18:58,031 --> 00:19:01,028
to the research at least in the evolution

429
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:03,030
of open end evolution of cultural

430
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,031
landscape.

431
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:08,035
So to sum up things, I just presented a

432
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,038
paper that is called anomaly Motivity and

433
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,041
that speaks unsurprisingly of embedded

434
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,043
normativity.

435
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,047
First major point is that if active

436
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,050
inference is correct, then our notion of

437
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,053
agency is dissolved essentially in the

438
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:28,055
notion that we can perceive and enact

439
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,057
cognitive landscape.

440
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:32,059
Umvelt, if you want.

441
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,063
And given that this is the case, we will

442
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,067
experience the norms and value that guide

443
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,069
our behavior as a property of the

444
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:44,071
cognitive landscape.

445
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:48,075
We experience the affordance that we can

446
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,078
perceive and this specific regime of

447
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:54,081
normativity I call embedded normativity.

448
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:58,085
And the third thing is that you have a

449
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,081
critical thing going on.

450
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:03,084
You have a semiotically constraining

451
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:06,087
thing going on in the externalization and

452
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,089
internalization of regimes of embedded

453
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,092
mativity because those two things they

454
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:14,095
respectively enable embedded Motivity to

455
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:16,097
exist, to have a causal power and they

456
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:19,100
enable also the open ended evolution of

457
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,102
the norms that are embedded in a given

458
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,105
landscape in a given material landscape

459
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,108
and therefore the open end evolution of

460
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,110
the asseted, cultural or committee

461
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,112
landscape.

462
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:33,114
So thank you.

463
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,116
I will enroll my references slides in

464
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,119
case someone really needs to know what

465
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:41,122
the reference is and is ready to move

466
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,124
around the video for this.

467
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,126
And do you have questions?

468
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:48,129
Daniel: Awesome.

469
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:48,129
Thank you.

470
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,131
Avel, while people are typing any

471
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:53,133
questions, could you maybe just give a

472
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,135
little introduction to the active

473
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,138
inference for the Social Sciences

474
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
course?

475
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:00,135
Like, what brought you to want to

476
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,137
facilitate this effort and where are we

477
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,140
at and where do you want it to go?

478
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,141
What do you want it to be for?

479
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,147
Oh, mute and then continue.

480
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,152
Avel: Good point.

481
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:17,152
Thank you.

482
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,156
The Active Inference Institute organizes

483
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,159
and kerose Research organize a course on

484
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,162
active inference in the social science

485
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,165
that is based essentially in explaining

486
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,167
the basic demarch, the basic hypothesis

487
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,170
and the consequences of the cultural

488
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,173
landscape formalism that I hinted at

489
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,175
slightly in this presentation.

490
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,179
The goal of the course is to give basic

491
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,182
ontology that is an interface between

492
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,184
complexity science, let us say physics,

493
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,187
written large cognitive science and

494
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,188
social science to afford

495
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,191
interdisciplinary collaboration in the

496
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,193
social science and in the study of the

497
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,190
evolution of human societies.

498
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,193
And I think it is cool, but I'm biased

499
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:05,194
because I've missed it.

500
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,197
So maybe you should ask Daniel, which is

501
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:11,200
absolutely unbiased, whether the course

502
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,201
is cool.

503
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:15,204
Daniel: I've been enjoying it a lot.

504
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:17,206
We just finished last week with my

505
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,208
section on collective behavior.

506
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,210
First we had the introduction lecture

507
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,212
from you, then Ben White on the basics of

508
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:25,214
being an active agent.

509
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:27,216
And we have Lorena and Mao's sections

510
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,219
upcoming, as well as your more dedicated

511
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
session.

512
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,223
Yeah, it's been a really fun experience

513
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:38,227
and it's going to provide a really useful

514
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:42,231
missing piece in the ecosystem, I guess.

515
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:43,232
Just one question.

516
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:47,236
How do we take some of these topics you'

517
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:50,239
're bringing in about the embedded

518
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,242
normativities and think about them

519
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:53,242
digitally?

520
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:57,246
Like, are we talking about conceptual

521
00:22:57,246 --> 00:23:01,244
embeddedness in information environments

522
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:04,247
and or are we talking about the

523
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,250
ergonomics of sitting at our desk?

524
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,254
Or how do we bring that kind of pleasure

525
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:14,257
path stigma g on the ground into the

526
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,260
digital are we talking about something

527
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,263
that's embodied and embedded in the

528
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:24,267
information space or are we still talking

529
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:25,268
about bodies?

530
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,274
Avel: So if we talk about humans, we talk

531
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,276
about bodies with the brain that do

532
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:35,278
things in a mature environment.

533
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:38,280
But your question is I'm not sure

534
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,283
understood is how can we bring this

535
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,285
specific concept in the study of digital

536
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,286
phenomena?

537
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,287
I cannot.

538
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,289
Twitter internet.

539
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:47,290
Daniel: Is that it?

540
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,291
Yeah.

541
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,294
Avel: Okay, so you have basically the

542
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:53,296
whole study on the affordances, the

543
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:56,299
discipline of design has incorporated a

544
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:59,302
while ago the national affordance in its

545
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:00,297
structure.

546
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,300
And most of the study in the digital

547
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,303
design centers are on what platforms

548
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:08,305
afford or do not afford.

549
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:11,308
And you have richer stance when you take

550
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:14,311
into account not what you can do with a

551
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:17,314
specific interface, but what the specific

552
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:19,316
interface invites you to do.

553
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:25,322
Given a set of cultural written large, it

554
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:32,329
can be self learning, but given a set of

555
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:38,335
power that you share with the platform in

556
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:44,341
a way that is formal but indirect yes.

557
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:48,345
I would look at it in terms of user

558
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:50,346
interface design.

559
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:53,350
I think this concept specifically is

560
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,353
useful for interface design.

561
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:01,352
Then you have implicitly the question of

562
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,355
the flow that platforms such as, I don't

563
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:05,356
know, twitter.

564
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,359
Facebook how specific structure

565
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,363
environments bring specific collective

566
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:15,366
dynamics that may be a bit richer.

567
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,368
Not richer specifically, but that may go

568
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:18,369
in.

569
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,372
A direction that the user face question

570
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,374
do not go into and that can still be

571
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:26,377
modeled in terms of constraints and

572
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,379
therefore in terms of embedded

573
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:30,380
normativity.

574
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:31,382
Is that on point?

575
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:33,384
We'll go to your question.

576
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,390
Daniel: Yeah, that's interesting about

577
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,393
what the interface does and then what it

578
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
invites.

579
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:44,395
It might invite things.

580
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,399
In order for that invitation to be

581
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,401
fulfilled, it has to actually provide

582
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:51,402
that possibility.

583
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:55,406
But it might invite things that aren't

584
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:56,407
relationally possible.

585
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,405
Like there might be a wall which invites

586
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,408
climbing to a given observer, yet they

587
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,409
cannot climb it.

588
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,413
And then on the other side is a capacity

589
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:11,416
that isn't invited and that is the

590
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,419
adjacent possible of tool use where

591
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,422
something that was being used for this

592
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:20,425
purpose, it's like all of a sudden it

593
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:24,429
just fell out of someone's hand.

594
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,431
They grasped it a different way, it

595
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:28,432
invited a different engagement.

596
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,435
And then that can become re entrenched

597
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,437
and that points to that sequential making

598
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:35,440
and breaking of new spaces that your work

599
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,442
has featured over the last few years.

600
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:39,444
Avel: Yes, exactly.

601
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,446
This work has been developed while

602
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:44,449
thinking about tool use, while thinking

603
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,451
about cognitive archaeology, while

604
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:49,454
thinking about the experience of cities,

605
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,456
the way urbanism prompts specific

606
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,457
behavior.

607
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,460
But if I can get back on the Internet

608
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,463
thing, I'd like to make it more specific.

609
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
.

610
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,460
So the interface design, as far as I know

611
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,462
is focused on interface.

612
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:07,466
That is not surprising, but in doing so

613
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:10,469
it is focused on specific fordance and

614
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,471
what you can do.

615
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,473
You have another layer in ecological

616
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:16,475
psychology, which is the layer of

617
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:17,476
solicitation.

618
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:20,479
So, for example, Twitter does something

619
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:23,482
very specific, which is when you log in,

620
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:26,485
it shows you the number of notifications

621
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:29,488
you have, then it removes it and you have

622
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:31,490
to wait to know which were those

623
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,492
notification.

624
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:36,495
And you have to wait not 1 second, not 1

625
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:38,497
minute, but a random amount of time.

626
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:41,500
So this is what they call dark patterns.

627
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,503
They are patterns in design that are

628
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:47,506
explicitly designed to create addiction.

629
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:50,509
So this is a layer you can't afford in

630
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,511
affordance, because from an affordance

631
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:55,514
perspective there is just a moment you

632
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,516
can access the information and then a

633
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:00,513
moment you can't, and then the moment you

634
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
can again, there is nothing going on.

635
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,518
If you don't look at intrinsic motivation

636
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,521
and the way specific structure,

637
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,524
environment is perceived, the semantics,

638
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,527
maybe the meaning that given landscape

639
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,528
has for an agent.

640
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,531
And even if you look at this, you are

641
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,534
still looking at the platform in a way

642
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,536
that is embedded from the specific

643
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,538
patterns, that specific patterns of

644
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,541
things that people do on the platform.

645
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,544
If you have Twitter without the

646
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,546
aggressive QRTs and the way to

647
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,548
aggressively signal that you are in

648
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,551
whatever it is, is going on, you don't

649
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,554
have Twitter much, you have Mastodon

650
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,556
maybe that has very similar affordances

651
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,559
and very dissimilar solicitation.

652
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,562
So this is why you have to take

653
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,565
multiscale account of things.

654
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,567
And when you take multiscale account of

655
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,570
things you have to look at the semiotics

656
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,572
basically behavior, how specific

657
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,568
coordination occur at specific scales

658
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,571
around specific communication, specific

659
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:05,572
message passing.

660
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,575
And once you look at how specific message

661
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:11,578
become meaningful to specific agent, you

662
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:13,580
have a problem basically because this is

663
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,583
subjective, this is constructed through

664
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,585
the activity of the agent and whatever is

665
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,588
the range of time you are looking at, you

666
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:23,590
will have the construction of new

667
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,593
possibilities of adjustment possibles as

668
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,594
you put it.

669
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:31,598
And and yeah, this is the big question

670
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:34,601
that I think we are missing at the moment

671
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
in active inference.

672
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
Daniel: Awesome.

673
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:40,607
Well, thank you for this presentation.

674
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,610
Thanks for the social sciences work and

675
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,613
we're all looking forward to seeing how
