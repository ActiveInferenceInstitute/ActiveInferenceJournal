00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,586
Next up. Welcome Avel. We have Avel

2
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:24,466
Gwenen carlo with embedded normativity.

3
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,600
So thanks Avel to you.

4
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,670
Hello. Can you hear me? Yep.

5
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,254
And can you see the slides? I only

6
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,350
see the top left of the slide.

7
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,870
You only see the top just yeah.

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,280
Try again. Thank you.

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,922
Okay, about now? Yep. Looks great.

10
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:58,740
Thank you. Okay, good.

11
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,058
So I am Avelina Carlo. I'm interested in

12
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:05,102
multiscale collective organization.

13
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,338
This is why I came to active in France

14
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:10,262
to begin with. And the core question

15
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:12,486
I've been asking is basically when we

16
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:14,950
look at human organization, there is

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,918
creative evolution, there is a change

18
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:19,842
through time of the specific patterns

19
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:22,410
that are enacted. And this is very hard

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,986
to account for. And I have been trying

21
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:26,822
to pin down more and more specifically

22
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,762
what exactly is going on and how to

23
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:31,694
model it. So this specific work is a

24
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:34,554
work I wrote in the context of my PhD.

25
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,986
Of course, which is funded by the Escape

26
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:39,194
Project, a project in cognitive

27
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:43,300
archaeology that's interested in how

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,606
the archaeological landscape shape

29
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,746
cognition and vice versa. The title of

30
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,238
it is automated. No activity. An active

31
00:01:52,254 --> 00:01:55,662
inference of agency. An active inference

32
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:58,582
account of agency being flesh because

33
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:01,830
you will see very quickly why. So first

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,326
we will go through the existing work on

35
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,374
anchor cognition in the context of

36
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,486
active inference. Then we'll try to

37
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,638
expose the concept of embedded Motivity,

38
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:13,546
which we introduce here and what it

39
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,546
means. And then we'll look at the more

40
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,610
semiotic question around the

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,754
externalization and utilization of

42
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:23,130
normativity in cultural landscapes.

43
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,086
So first encouraged cognition in active

44
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:29,482
in France. So we know active inference.

45
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:31,726
I will go quickly over it. I still need

46
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:34,066
to do it because there are lookers that

47
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,846
are not familiar. So active inference

48
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,070
say that agents continuously predict

49
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,386
the specific queues sensory cues they

50
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:47,942
will see, and they predict the action or

51
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,102
policy they will not take. And they

52
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:53,126
basically enact an ongoing stream of

53
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:56,678
expectation that they reconstruct given

54
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,206
upcoming signal. So this is best Akotin

55
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,898
four in this schema which shows

56
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,042
the agent as the nickel system, which

57
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:09,322
engage through environment, through

58
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:12,480
action and cessations. And all of these

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,322
specific domains, they minimize

60
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:20,094
a specific function that is called free

61
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:23,474
energy and whose minimization basically

62
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:26,674
means there is a prerogative process

63
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,870
going on. And a core

64
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,258
property of active inference is that it

65
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:34,462
dissolves agency as we typically

66
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,774
understand it. We don't have agents that

67
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,286
have like an internal monologue that

68
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:42,246
drives them to take decision. We have a

69
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,894
conscious anticipation of what's going

70
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,594
on. And whatever an agent anticipates

71
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:49,898
itself to do, it will do. And so this

72
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:53,514
goes for computationally satisfying but

73
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,754
very deflationary notion of what is

74
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:59,654
going on with agency. So the

75
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,650
question then comes what is the relation

76
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,794
between an agent and the cognitive

77
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:08,494
landscape in which it evolves? I will

78
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,562
present very rapidly again the framework

79
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,746
of Skill and a pioneered by Brunborg,

80
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,990
Kierstein and Reidfield,

81
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,154
and which says that Skill agents, which

82
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,522
we understand as agents that understand

83
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:26,630
what is going on around them, they will

84
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,206
basically experience the world as a

85
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,382
landscape of affordances, which is

86
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:35,302
opportunities for actions and their

87
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,738
cognition pretty much reduces to the

88
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,770
experience of this landscape and

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,618
adaptive engagement with it, which

90
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:45,498
basically maximize the grip the agent

91
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:49,954
has on the system and essentially

92
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:52,382
for reasons we will not go over because

93
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,982
it's math the very existence experience

94
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:59,326
of this landscape. It is equivalent to

95
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:00,942
the existence of constraints over

96
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,218
attention. The attention that the agent

97
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,654
gives to thing which translates

98
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:09,426
the embodied expectation that are two

99
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,566
times embodied bad the embodied

100
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,290
expectation that the agent enacts.

101
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,806
And so this becomes very interesting

102
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:19,814
when we cross it with the existence of

103
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,694
enculturation in humans because the

104
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:25,074
basic experience we have of affordances,

105
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:26,866
of what we can do it is shaped

106
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,774
culturally, it is shaped by interaction

107
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:31,994
wherein we learn with other humans about

108
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,906
what we do, what we can do and what we

109
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:38,438
can do. And this means that the basic

110
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,694
human experience, it's thoroughly

111
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,874
encultured. It's embedded in what

112
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:45,974
Ramshed called landscape of cultural

113
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:49,822
fondencies and it is embedded in

114
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:53,886
cultural and material regimes

115
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,154
of attention so ways to pay attention to

116
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:00,290
things. And this is a figure that comes,

117
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,322
I believe, from this year on thinking

118
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:06,102
throughout the minds where it shows

119
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,722
basically how the action installation

120
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,160
cycle. When we have several agents,

121
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,438
they build a common environment that has

122
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:17,138
epistemic cues on how the world is like

123
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,182
and we are enculturated to pay attention

124
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,842
to things in a certain manner that makes

125
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,914
it so. We perceive and enact this

126
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:30,146
landscape and so the uncultured

127
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,202
constraint over the flow of attention

128
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,246
because of what we saw just before the

129
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:38,062
deflationary account of agency. It means

130
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:40,154
that the very expensive landscape,

131
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:42,026
cultural landscape that is collectively

132
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:45,022
enacted, it effectively integrates

133
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,886
intentionality, it effectively

134
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:51,298
integrates normativity in a way that

135
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:54,734
clashes strongly with classical account

136
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,510
of both. So,

137
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,486
given this state of the art,

138
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:03,554
let us look at what I mean specifically

139
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:06,754
by embedded normativity. So embedded

140
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,094
Motivity is a kind of normativity, I

141
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:13,614
think you have got it. So normativity

142
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,634
it means basically the criterions by

143
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:19,674
which we judge things to be good and bad

144
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,294
in the context of biological system they

145
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:26,174
will look for specific, I don't know,

146
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,366
chemical concentration and they will

147
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,398
avoid other this is the phenomenon of

148
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,738
chemotaxis, this is pretty basic and

149
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,474
this is a form of normativity. But for

150
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:39,246
humans we will typically think of laws,

151
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,086
cultural norms, culturally shared

152
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:46,642
way to judge behavior and again,

153
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,466
at least in the context of law and

154
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:50,998
choice theory we typically think there

155
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,486
is an agent, he has access to

156
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,646
information and will think what should I

157
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:58,546
do? And he will judge rationally about

158
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,114
what is good and what is bad based on a

159
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,206
collection of values which are internal

160
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,820
to the agent. This is not how it works.

161
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,734
What I call embodied Motivity is by

162
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,530
contrast regimes of normal activity

163
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,262
where it is the norms and value that

164
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:19,566
guide the agent's behavior. It is

165
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:21,306
embedded in the material and cultural

166
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:23,570
environment. So basically the agent

167
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,906
projects a specific set of norms and

168
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:28,414
value in the very experienced fitness

169
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:32,142
environment and it will perceive

170
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:35,366
the locus of normativity as the

171
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:37,926
environment and not as a form of

172
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,190
internal judgment.

173
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,790
Let us look at what can exactly how

174
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,366
embedded Motivity work. It will be more

175
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:51,246
concrete. So first we can materially

176
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,786
constrain people to do things. So for

177
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:56,186
example, there are roads, you can go off

178
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,006
roads but it's harder and you can't

179
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,362
really do that if you are a chariot. So

180
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,126
when you have a specific pattern of

181
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:05,966
roads which is constructed by cities you

182
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:07,374
are pretty much constrained to follow

183
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:10,766
the roads materially and for this we

184
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:14,014
will talk of structural embedding and

185
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,758
there is another regimes of

186
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,066
mezzanomativity where we build on

187
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,754
environments that will basically cue you

188
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,646
suggest you into adopting specific norms

189
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,878
and specific values. For example,

190
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:30,006
Escape thinks that vertical patterns in

191
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,706
archaeological culture they are somehow

192
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,234
embedded within what we'd call vertical

193
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:37,938
norms. So hierarchy and certification in

194
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:40,314
social relationship and for this

195
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,634
specific form of embedding we can talk

196
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,426
of semantic embedding. What must be

197
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:48,314
very clear is that we don't have

198
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:50,006
structural embedding on one side and

199
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,950
semantic embedding there are basically

200
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,730
two mechanism, complementary mechanism

201
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,130
in which embedded normativity occurs.

202
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,566
If we look at city so this is impression

203
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:07,666
of sumerian culture city states we

204
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:10,414
have matter organization that prompts

205
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:12,226
specific kind of behavior. So for

206
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,034
example, we have a bridge and this

207
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,690
bridge allow you constrain you to go

208
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,806
through the river in a specific way if

209
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:21,634
you are on foot. But these material

210
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:24,502
constraints it is perceivable. So by

211
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:26,726
seeing the bridge you will also see that

212
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,326
you can navigate the world in this

213
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:30,358
specific way. So you don't have a

214
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,026
sparration between semantic and

215
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,298
structural embedding. We just have two

216
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,146
ways in which constraints of our

217
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,962
behavior that are embedded in the

218
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,500
environment work,

219
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,986
and something that is core to the

220
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,438
account of embedded non activity is,

221
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,494
again, that it is not internal. But we

222
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:55,026
need to go into more detail about what

223
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,282
we mean by not being internal, because,

224
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,422
of course, we're talking about agency

225
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,646
agents constrain what agents do. It's

226
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:06,180
not outside what it is is

227
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,378
embedded. In Motivity is a regime of the

228
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:12,438
multivity where the norms and value,

229
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:14,246
they stem from the experience of

230
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:18,166
Fordance. For example, if I see fire I

231
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:22,042
will not think about hey, could I

232
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,650
put my hand in it and get my hand burn?

233
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,386
I think it would be painful. I won't do

234
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:30,286
that. If I even think about putting my

235
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:32,414
hand in the fire I will immediately feel

236
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:35,758
bad. The normativity it's embedded in my

237
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:39,566
experience of the world. I feel like the

238
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:42,014
fire or more specifically the

239
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:43,698
possibility of putting my hand in the

240
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,962
fire is intrinsically bad. I do not feel

241
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,214
there is a possibility that is neutral

242
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,860
and then I judge to be bad.

243
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,826
But of course this

244
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,614
judgment does not occur outside even if

245
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,794
I feel like it's about my affordances.

246
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,294
It emerges from the engagement I have

247
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,806
with the material and cultural niche in

248
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:10,374
which I find myself. And if we

249
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:13,734
want to untangle what this

250
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,786
means precisely we will have to go into

251
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,762
more detail into what I call the

252
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,022
externalization internalization of many

253
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:24,222
normativity. So let us look at something

254
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:27,054
very simple how normativity work for

255
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:30,286
embodied agents. So embodied agents,

256
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:33,506
they do things hopefully in a

257
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:37,726
niche that is material and this niche

258
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:41,266
will be marked by the activity of my

259
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:44,162
agent. And these marks, they can then

260
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,738
act as constraints either through

261
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:49,366
structural or cementing embedding in the

262
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:50,998
agent's firmament because they basically

263
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:53,606
signify that in the past I wanted to do

264
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,646
that. Maybe doing that is good. For

265
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:59,158
example, we have centuries with I don't

266
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:01,242
know if centuries English word but web

267
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:05,114
path if animals that have legs this is

268
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,698
actually important walk on a specific

269
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:11,878
path, they will compact the earth and it

270
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,966
will become improper to grow anything,

271
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:17,406
even grass. And you will have paths that

272
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,146
will emerge that are pretty neat, it's

273
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,774
pretty visible and that tell you hey,

274
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,722
not only this earth is compact and allow

275
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:28,082
you to walk on it without effort but

276
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:31,906
also this has been widely judged to

277
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:37,026
be a good outline

278
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,662
for navigation in this specific

279
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,878
environment. So the very experience of a

280
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:45,574
path basically invites you you

281
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:47,586
perceive the affordance of walking

282
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,250
through the path and this is something

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,282
that again can result from your own

284
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:53,866
activity that can be written into

285
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,850
development by your own activity.

286
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,994
And so this begs the question of how

287
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:02,854
okay, there exists embedded nomativity

288
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:05,226
but how do we embed nomativity? What is

289
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:07,520
the activity of embedding mativity like?

290
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,054
And the word I will use for that is

291
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,890
externalization. We perceive the world

292
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,686
because we externalize specific causes

293
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:19,886
of sensation into an imagined objective

294
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:23,330
external world. So when we see the path,

295
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,802
we see a path. We do not see compact

296
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,310
earth that we then compute to mean

297
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,838
that other things have worked on it. We

298
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:35,686
just see hey, there is a path. And this

299
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,466
is because we have externalized a

300
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,946
specific cognitive kind which is the

301
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:44,380
path. And this is argument that

302
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,166
several people made here lene Steiner,

303
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,814
which if I remember well, worked on the

304
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:56,266
production of devices that help blind

305
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:58,480
people see things through,

306
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,090
I believe an array of repetitive device

307
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,186
on their shoulder. So the core

308
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:08,386
argument they make is that if you give

309
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,002
people that they will start seeing

310
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,254
things, they will start perceiving

311
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:15,206
things as being before them rather than

312
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,758
having vibration on the shoulder and

313
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:18,710
then thinking about what does it mean.

314
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,414
And so the basic argument is that

315
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:25,122
perception is just picture

316
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:28,666
of what cause we infer, what is the

317
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:31,190
structure we infer of our environment

318
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,922
given the existence of a specific

319
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:35,114
coupling device that relates action to

320
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:39,130
sensation and vice versa. And this

321
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,330
critically relies on the internalization

322
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,846
of specific. We could say a lot of

323
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,462
things that I will say priors specific,

324
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:49,294
priors knowledge and perception. So me

325
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:52,142
seeing the path as a path relies on me

326
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:54,814
having the prior knowledge that there is

327
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:57,186
such a thing as paths and I should be

328
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,914
expecting to see them around. And so you

329
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:04,866
have duality of externalization and

330
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:06,514
internalization in the production of

331
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:10,034
embedded mativity. I can only see norms

332
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,562
out there if I've internalized

333
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,646
integrated a specific apparatus of

334
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:17,266
perception that entails that there are

335
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,994
indeed those specific norms that are

336
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:22,250
embedded in those specific affordances.

337
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,330
And so this produce a more general

338
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,474
question of semantics, particularly of

339
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:31,806
information theory. How do reading and

340
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,000
writing and reading maturity works?

341
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,590
So when I extend lies I treat

342
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,426
the world as having specific natural

343
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,730
categories that I pretty much imagine

344
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,886
and I can use them because I imagine

345
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,634
them as an extended memory that allow me

346
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:51,282
to read and write normative cues. This

347
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:54,826
can be letters, pure signs.

348
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,222
But as far as I'm concerned here, all

349
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:59,234
signs are at least implicitly normative.

350
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,334
There about how you should interpret the

351
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:05,334
sign. And this means that

352
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:08,154
we can experience specific landscape of

353
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:12,266
forensics and we

354
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,794
can write things out there. We can write

355
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:17,194
normative cues, bio behavior that will

356
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:19,402
then constrain further behavior. But

357
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:24,046
nothing tells us that we

358
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:26,926
can communicate through this. The

359
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,486
communication, it works because of the

360
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,582
internalization of prayers. If a given

361
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:33,598
community of agents have internalized a

362
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:36,366
specific set of prayers that is, a set

363
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,282
of prayers that enable externalization

364
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:41,874
of numerative cues, then only it can use

365
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:46,146
the environment as a way to write

366
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:50,050
and read. Normative queues as embedded

367
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,462
normativity thing. And this

368
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:55,942
communication, it can be read in terms

369
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:57,706
of information theory. Of course it can

370
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,674
be read in terms of semantics. But what

371
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,370
is critical to analyze that the process

372
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,700
of internalization there is no

373
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,202
trust system there is no private key

374
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,766
that allow you to be sure that the way

375
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,670
you internalize norms is very

376
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,590
specifically the way in which the

377
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,734
Emily Mativity was encouraged to begin

378
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:22,786
with. There is a loss, or there is

379
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,938
ambiguity, or there is I'd rather say it

380
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:28,306
like this an active demarch of

381
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:31,586
reconstruction, of given prayers by the

382
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:34,802
agent. And so this gap between

383
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:37,714
the intent of other communicants and my

384
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,806
intent, my understanding of what they

385
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,166
meant by their active engagement with

386
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,486
the world, it builds a tiny gap in

387
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,678
information that is somehow enough to

388
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,058
drive the open ended evolution of

389
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,394
cultural landscape. And this is

390
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,586
something that I do not think is

391
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,634
embedded in active in France and I think

392
00:18:56,672 --> 00:19:00,046
is of major interest to research, to the

393
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,918
research at least in the evolution of

394
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,386
open end evolution of cultural

395
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:07,200
landscape. So to sum up things,

396
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,214
I just presented a paper that is called

397
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,926
anomaly Motivity and that speaks

398
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,130
unsurprisingly of embedded normativity.

399
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,598
First major point is that if active

400
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:23,074
inference is correct, then our

401
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,066
notion of agency is dissolved

402
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:27,542
essentially in the notion that we can

403
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:30,786
perceive and enact cognitive landscape.

404
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:35,720
Umvelt, if you want. And given

405
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,402
that this is the case, we will

406
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,386
experience the norms and value that

407
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:44,026
guide our behavior as a property of the

408
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,626
cognitive landscape. We experience the

409
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:49,050
affordance that we can perceive and

410
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,054
this specific regime of normativity I

411
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,022
call embedded normativity. And the third

412
00:19:57,076 --> 00:20:00,174
thing is that you have a critical thing

413
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:03,022
going on. You have a semiotically

414
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,026
constraining thing going on in the

415
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:07,314
externalization and internalization of

416
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:10,660
regimes of embedded mativity because

417
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,894
those two things they respectively

418
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:16,066
enable embedded Motivity to exist, to

419
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:19,730
have a causal power and they enable also

420
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,586
the open ended evolution of the norms

421
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:23,826
that are embedded in a given landscape

422
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,414
in a given material landscape and

423
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:28,054
therefore the open end evolution of the

424
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,146
asseted, cultural or committee

425
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:34,118
landscape. So thank you. I will

426
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:37,642
enroll my references slides in case

427
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,150
someone really needs to know what the

428
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,254
reference is and is ready to move around

429
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:45,294
the video for this. And do you have

430
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:48,686
questions? Awesome. Thank you.

431
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,054
Avel, while people are typing any

432
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:53,802
questions, could you maybe just give a

433
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,806
little introduction to the active

434
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,310
inference for the Social Sciences

435
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,762
course? Like, what brought you to want

436
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:03,666
to facilitate this effort and where are

437
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:05,334
we at and where do you want it to go?

438
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:06,840
What do you want it to be for?

439
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,630
Oh, mute and then continue.

440
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,056
Good point. Thank you. The Active

441
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:21,536
Inference Institute organizes and kerose

442
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:25,076
Research organize a course on active

443
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,128
inference in the social science that is

444
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:30,170
based essentially in explaining the

445
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,372
basic demarch, the basic hypothesis and

446
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,576
the consequences of the cultural

447
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:38,764
landscape formalism that I hinted at

448
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:41,020
slightly in this presentation.

449
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,744
The goal of the course is to give basic

450
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,264
ontology that is an interface between

451
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:49,292
complexity science, let us say physics,

452
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:51,696
written large cognitive science and

453
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,580
social science to afford

454
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,536
interdisciplinary collaboration in

455
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:59,476
the social science and in the study of

456
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:02,276
the evolution of human societies. And I

457
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:05,204
think it is cool, but I'm biased because

458
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,508
I've missed it. So maybe you should ask

459
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:10,416
Daniel, which is absolutely unbiased,

460
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:13,896
whether the course is cool. I've been

461
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,872
enjoying it a lot. We just finished last

462
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,516
week with my section on collective

463
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:21,252
behavior. First we had the introduction

464
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:23,276
lecture from you, then Ben White on the

465
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,756
basics of being an active agent. And we

466
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,856
have Lorena and Mao's sections upcoming,

467
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,776
as well as your more dedicated session.

468
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:35,168
Yeah, it's been a really fun experience

469
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,512
and it's going to provide a really

470
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:40,050
useful missing piece

471
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,072
in the ecosystem, I guess. Just one

472
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:46,930
question. How do we take some of these

473
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,676
topics you're bringing in about the

474
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:52,772
embedded normativities and think about

475
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:55,332
them digitally? Like, are we talking

476
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:58,740
about conceptual embeddedness

477
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,776
in information environments and or are

478
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,992
we talking about the ergonomics of

479
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:08,920
sitting at our desk? Or how do we bring

480
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,100
that kind of pleasure path stigma g

481
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,636
on the ground into the digital are we

482
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:19,304
talking about something that's embodied

483
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:23,244
and embedded in the information space

484
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:25,920
or are we still talking about bodies?

485
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,124
So if we talk about humans, we talk

486
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,044
about bodies with the brain that do

487
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:36,716
things in a mature environment. But your

488
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,824
question is I'm not sure understood is

489
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:41,388
how can we bring this specific concept

490
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:43,968
in the study of digital phenomena? I

491
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:47,232
cannot. Twitter internet. Is that

492
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:50,096
it? Yeah. Okay, so you have basically

493
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:52,740
the whole study on the affordances,

494
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,596
the discipline of design has

495
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:58,544
incorporated a while ago the national

496
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:02,356
affordance in its structure. And most of

497
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,336
the study in the digital design centers

498
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:07,604
are on what platforms afford or do not

499
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:11,332
afford. And you have richer

500
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,192
stance when you take into account not

501
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,160
what you can do with a specific

502
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,692
interface, but what the specific

503
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:20,892
interface invites you to do. Given a set

504
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:24,510
of cultural written large,

505
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,692
it can be self learning,

506
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:30,290
but given a set of power that you share

507
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,656
with the platform in a

508
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:40,720
way that is formal but indirect

509
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,208
yes. I would look at it in terms of user

510
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:51,632
interface design. I think this concept

511
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:55,704
specifically is useful for

512
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:59,064
interface design. Then you

513
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:02,276
have implicitly the question of the flow

514
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:05,000
that platforms such as, I don't know,

515
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,336
twitter. Facebook how specific structure

516
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,416
environments bring specific collective

517
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:15,736
dynamics that may be a bit richer.

518
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:17,996
Not richer specifically, but that may go

519
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,120
in. A direction that the user face

520
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,904
question do not go into and that can

521
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:26,364
still be modeled in terms of constraints

522
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:29,036
and therefore in terms of embedded

523
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,952
normativity. Is that on point?

524
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:33,270
We'll go to your question.

525
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,364
Yeah, that's interesting about what the

526
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:42,992
interface does and then what it invites.

527
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:46,632
It might invite things. In order

528
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,616
for that invitation to be fulfilled, it

529
00:25:48,638 --> 00:25:50,952
has to actually provide that

530
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:53,752
possibility. But it might invite things

531
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:57,372
that aren't relationally possible. Like

532
00:25:57,426 --> 00:25:59,144
there might be a wall which invites

533
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:02,684
climbing to a given observer, yet they

534
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:05,852
cannot climb it. And then on the other

535
00:26:05,906 --> 00:26:09,532
side is a capacity

536
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:13,890
that isn't invited and that is

537
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,392
the adjacent possible of tool use where

538
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:21,104
something that was being used for this

539
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,168
purpose, it's like all of a sudden it

540
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:24,436
just fell out of someone's hand. They

541
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,316
grasped it a different way, it invited a

542
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:28,756
different engagement. And then that can

543
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,644
become re entrenched and that points to

544
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:33,376
that sequential making and breaking of

545
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:36,068
new spaces that your work has featured

546
00:26:36,084 --> 00:26:39,240
over the last few years. Yes, exactly.

547
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,648
This work has been developed while

548
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,744
thinking about tool use, while thinking

549
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:46,356
about cognitive archaeology, while

550
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,352
thinking about the experience of cities,

551
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:51,740
the way urbanism prompts specific

552
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,436
behavior. But if I can

553
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,956
get back on the Internet thing, I'd like

554
00:26:56,978 --> 00:26:59,664
to make it more specific. So the

555
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,504
interface design, as far as I know is

556
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,760
focused on interface.

557
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,824
That is not surprising, but in doing

558
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:10,476
so it is focused on specific fordance

559
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,140
and what you can do. You have another

560
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,228
layer in ecological psychology, which is

561
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:18,436
the layer of solicitation. So, for

562
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,332
example, Twitter does something very

563
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:24,150
specific, which is when you log in,

564
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,908
it shows you the number of notifications

565
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,656
you have, then it removes it and you

566
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:32,440
have to wait to know which were those

567
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,336
notification. And you have to wait not 1

568
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:37,624
second, not 1 minute, but a random

569
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:40,636
amount of time. So this is what they

570
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,420
call dark patterns. They are patterns in

571
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,764
design that are explicitly designed to

572
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:49,036
create addiction. So this is a layer you

573
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:53,536
can't afford in affordance, because from

574
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:55,264
an affordance perspective there is just

575
00:27:55,302 --> 00:27:57,168
a moment you can access the information

576
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,664
and then a moment you can't, and then

577
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:01,684
the moment you can again, there is

578
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,876
nothing going on. If you don't look at

579
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,924
intrinsic motivation and the way

580
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:08,164
specific structure, environment is

581
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:12,964
perceived, the semantics, maybe the

582
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:15,176
meaning that given landscape has for an

583
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:17,304
agent. And even if you look at this,

584
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:20,056
you are still looking at the platform in

585
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:23,448
a way that is embedded from the specific

586
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:26,596
patterns, that specific patterns

587
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:28,076
of things that people do on the

588
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:30,252
platform. If you have Twitter without

589
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:33,772
the aggressive QRTs and the way to

590
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:36,172
aggressively signal that you are in

591
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,008
whatever it is, is going on, you don't

592
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:40,388
have Twitter much, you have Mastodon

593
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:43,516
maybe that has very similar affordances

594
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:46,640
and very dissimilar solicitation.

595
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,944
So this is why you have to take

596
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,676
multiscale account of things. And when

597
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,212
you take multiscale account of things

598
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,096
you have to look at the semiotics

599
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:58,116
basically behavior, how specific

600
00:28:58,218 --> 00:29:01,168
coordination occur at specific scales

601
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:04,328
around specific communication, specific

602
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:07,752
message passing. And once you look

603
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:10,392
at how specific message become

604
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:12,090
meaningful to specific agent,

605
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,320
you have a problem basically because

606
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,076
this is subjective, this is constructed

607
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:18,890
through the activity of the agent and

608
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,216
whatever is the range of time you are

609
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:23,256
looking at, you will have the

610
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,016
construction of new possibilities of

611
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,384
adjustment possibles as you put it. And

612
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,490
and yeah, this is the

613
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,700
big question that I think we are missing

614
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,720
at the moment in active inference.

615
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,984
Awesome. Well, thank you for this

616
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:42,640
presentation. Thanks for the social

617
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,704
sciences work and we're all looking

618
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,184
forward to seeing how the projects play

619
00:29:47,222 --> 00:29:51,420
out. Thank you. Goodbye. Farewell AVO.
