1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,170
All right,

2
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,000
the next session is going to be the

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,640
final session of this symposium.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,240
It's been a really incredible journey,

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,928
and I think this final session is going

6
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:34,464
to be great as well. So we have

7
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,930
a whole panel here,

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,952
and people can

9
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,144
use their cameras, even though I'm not

10
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:47,370
if they want to welcome everyone,

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,172
I'll just introduce the facilitator,

12
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:55,144
Kurt Jamungol. So Kurt is a legend

13
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:57,404
in the active ecosystem and has done

14
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:01,180
incredible work with a variety of

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,648
researchers and curious individuals in

16
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:06,224
the space, so we could think of no one

17
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:10,850
better to host this conversation and

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,908
bring it all together. So, Kurt,

19
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:18,288
I'll pass it to you. You'll keep an eye

20
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:21,076
on the live chat. Anyone can call it if

21
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,860
they need any supports. Otherwise,

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,912
thanks, everybody, for joining.

23
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:30,624
And we don't see you yet, Kurt.

24
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:32,888
But yeah, it would it be all right if I

25
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:34,056
left and then came right back? For

26
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,176
whatever reason, my camera is not

27
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:36,776
working. Sounds good. Sounds good.

28
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:39,064
Okay, I'll be right back in about 25

29
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:39,800
seconds.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,990
Well, welcome, everyone.

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,420
We will get started in just a second.

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,174
It's so

33
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:09,022
odd. I apologize for that. Okay,

34
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:12,080
well, you can hear my voice, at least.

35
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,100
Yes, just give me a moment.

36
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,660
Boy. Okay,

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,720
well, we'll do what we can. Okay,

38
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,426
so you all can't see me, but that's

39
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,622
all right. So we have this all star

40
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,726
panel here today, which to me means my

41
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:39,926
invitation must have been a mistake,

42
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,546
but I'll take it. Thank you to the

43
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,498
active inference institutes. And I'll go

44
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:44,906
around this virtual zoom table and

45
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:48,086

science and consciousness service

76
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:14,786
initiatives. My name is Kurt Chamongle,

77
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,058
and I use my background in mathematical

78
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:19,226
physics to analyze various theories of

79
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,274
everything that are proposed. These

80
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,366
include both the theoretical physics

81
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,334
side of grand unification with gravity

82
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,818
and dualities other schemes, as well as

83
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:29,114
attempting to understand what

84
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:31,158
constitutes consciousness. You can find

85
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,766
the podcast by typing in theories of

86
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:34,222
everything onto YouTube or whatever

87
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:37,534
podcast catcher you have. So my question

88
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:40,414
to everyone. The initial question is

89
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:41,938
what have you been working on in the

90
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,906
past few months and what excites you

91
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:48,590
about it? We'll start with Bert.

92
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,178
You seem to be smiling and your

93
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:53,490
name sounds like mine.

94
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,490
Okay. All right, so my name is

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,326
Bertovis, and yeah. I lead a lab in

96
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:47,470
an electrical engineering department.

97
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,974
And so our lab is called Bislab, as you

98
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:53,006
mentioned. So we are interested in

99
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,554
Bayesian inference in general, but more

100
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,906
specifically in doing it as fast as

101
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:00,798
possible. That has lots of applications

102
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:04,194
outside active inference, also for

103
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,338
signal processing and other control

104
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:08,066
systems, but definitely, of course,

105
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:10,742
also for active inference. So half our

106
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,542
work over the past few months, but even

107
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:15,174
over the past few years has been on

108
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:18,486
developing a toolbox to support or to

109
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,046
get as far as we can go with trying to

110
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,034
do real time Bayesian inference or real

111
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:26,282
time free energy minimization and trying

112
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,090
it in applications.

113
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,634
So that's the work that I

114
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:36,186
try to lead a team of PhD students who

115
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,334
do the real work. Of course, I walk

116
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:40,906
around with a cup of coffee, but that's

117
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:42,480
what they've been working on.

118
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,500
Great. And Professor Lemke, please.

119
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,146
Yeah, well, what I've been working on in

120
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:56,494
the last, I don't know, year or so is

121
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,440
spending a lot of time thinking about

122
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,846
how it is that a faith framework in

123
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,750
particular surrendered to a higher

124
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,920
power, improves people's lives.

125
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,294
And I've been really struggling to come

126
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:12,986
up with a way of talking about this that

127
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:14,954
is inclusive. Thinking about it,

128
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:18,106
talking about it, it gets to a

129
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,166
kind of core piece of it that I'm

130
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,570
interested in, which is not so much

131
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,846
whether or not God exists and what the

132
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,710
proof is or not of whether God exists.

133
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,974
But really, what is it that changes in

134
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,406
people's lives when they undergo a

135
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,994
spiritual transformation, when they

136
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:38,562
surrender to a higher power? Why do

137
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:41,314
their lives get better when they do get

138
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:45,246
better? And I'm really new to the active

139
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,166
inference world. Daniel Friedman is the

140
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:50,930
one who's introduced me to these ideas.

141
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,126
I'm really excited about the ways in

142
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,480
which the whole active inference model

143
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,754
might help me at least think about

144
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:01,180
what's going on.

145
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,618
I'm that's what I'm working on. It's a

146
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:06,486
little weird, but that's what I'm

147
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:10,810
interested in. Great. Professor Friston,

148
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,198
you're muted. Yes,

149
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:18,782
that's going to be the title of my next

150
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:23,114
book. Karl, you're on mute retro

151
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:26,240
from the possibly the future.

152
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,986
I generally work on what I'm told to

153
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,306
work on, so I'm just trying to list what

154
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,074
I've been working on in the past few

155
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:37,650
months. Interestingly. It actually

156
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,574
starts with Daniel Friedman and his

157
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,930
fascination, along with Axel constant

158
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,406
for evolutionary explanations that speak

159
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,038
to many of the scale free issues that

160
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:53,094
we've been hearing about in the prior

161
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:55,770
session. So that's what I was working

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,946
on, really. A scale free approach to

163
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:03,174
understanding temporary nested processes

164
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:05,438
as free energy minimizing processes as a

165
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,014
kind of active inference and how that

166
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,734
would lead to a variational synthesis of

167
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:13,294
evolution. And then I was told to work

168
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,246
on belief sharing by Mahault and

169
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:18,740
colleagues at Versus and

170
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,434
worked on that in the context of

171
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,980
synthetic language and tried to

172
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,078
establish a really simple proof of

173
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:31,286
principle that communication was an

174
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:34,082
emergent property of any free ensemble,

175
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,600
free energy minimizing system.

176
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,486
And just to open brackets, just to make

177
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:42,234
the observation, it struck me time and

178
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,402
time again during the session today how

179
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:48,474
important communication is, whether

180
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:50,806
we're talking about Bert's passing

181
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:54,230
messages or responding to you've got

182
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,206
a new posterior, or we're talking about

183
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,114
the kind of communication that Mahault

184
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:00,858
was talking about. Well, everybody's

185
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:03,134
been talking about. It does seem to be

186
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:06,906
really, indeed, the Gaia notion

187
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,650
of overconnectivity and too much

188
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,826
communication or the wrong kind of

189
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:15,166
communication. It does strike me that's

190
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,658
quite central to both the theme

191
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:23,046
of the workshop and

192
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,586
the specific presentations that we've

193
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,886
heard. And then in the past few weeks,

194
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,866
working on stuff I think that Bert would

195
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:36,330
be more interested in, which is fast

196
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,740
and frugal message passing schemes that

197
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,966
enable the evaluation of the expected

198
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:46,446
free energy, not to suffer from the

199
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:48,138
limitations imposed by deep tree

200
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:51,710
searches. So possibly Ashwin has

201
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,106
spoken about this earlier on, but you're

202
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,046
using ideas from dynamic programming,

203
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,794
backwards induction to try and take

204
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:02,514
the pressure off the message passing to

205
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:05,938
get fast and efficient evaluations of

206
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:09,000
the expected free energy in sort of

207
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,786
single unit, single agent active

208
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,854
inference. What have I been doing this

209
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,720
week? Can't remember.

210
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,386
That's what I've been doing. Great.

211
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,500
Raphael kaufman, please.

212
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,030
Just a moment.

213
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,430
Can everyone else hear? Okay.

214
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,932
What about now? Yeah, great. Yeah,

215
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:46,516
thanks. It's contagious, I think. So

216
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,224
I've also been drinking a lot of coffee

217
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:51,144
as I've been caring for my now nine

218
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:52,520
month old daughter.

219
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,964
Congratulations. Thank you. So aside

220
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:58,536
from sleep deprivation, what I've been

221
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:02,330
doing is I

222
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,336
told you guys about this in the session

223
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:08,056
earlier today, but in a nutshell, we've

224
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:11,144
been working on what we call the Gaia

225
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,870
Protocol, or the Gaia network, which is

226
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,252
this open approach for

227
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:21,888
building a common engine. Think of

228
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:25,730
it as a common runtime and a common

229
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,012
language with the building blocks of

230
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:33,556
shared decision making in

231
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,048
the context of the Med crisis,

232
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:39,510
and getting to a set of

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,648
building blocks for decision making that

234
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:45,290
don't kill us all. So that's kind of it.

235
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,696
Rafael, how much coffee is a lot of

236
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:52,196
coffee? Well, it's espresso,

237
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:53,664
so I don't think it's quite comparable

238
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,870
to American coffee. All right.

239
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,316
And Guillaume dumas, please. Yes, sure.

240
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:06,028
Can you hear me? Yes. Okay.

241
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,320
So in the context of active inference,

242
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,856
I have mostly focused on, well, the two

243
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,716
big topics of my lab. So precision

244
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:16,608
psychiatry and social physiology. So.

245
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:20,592
On the precision psychiatry side, ninka

246
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:23,044
Boyton presented earlier in this

247
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:25,988
symposium our work on trying to model

248
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:28,484
theory of mind to being able to

249
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:31,148
evaluate, through digital phenotyping,

250
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,616
the level of sophistication of

251
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:34,344
interaction in patients with

252
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:37,192
neurodevelopmental disorders. And that

253
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:40,056
connect with also our interest in the

254
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,900
social mind and how we can connect our

255
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,524
understanding of how we deal with other

256
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:50,396
people but with also ourselves. And so

257
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:53,356
that connect with other work at the

258
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,592
mila, with deep learning architecture,

259
00:13:55,656 --> 00:14:00,000
with higher order function

260
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,132
in humans, where we're trying to combine

261
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:04,524
different theories of consciousness,

262
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:06,864
such as global neural workspace and

263
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:08,428
attention schema theory. And in the

264
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:10,224
context of attention schema theory,

265
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:13,108
there is this kind of recycling of self

266
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:16,790
and other mechanisms. So that's one

267
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,988
big work. And on the other side, I'm

268
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,784
very interested also in multi agent

269
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:27,796
systems. And so with Natalie Castell,

270
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:30,410
who's going to join us soon,

271
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,984
we've been working on creativity and the

272
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,256
emergence of cultural norms in multi

273
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:38,296
agent systems with the idea of applying

274
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:41,836
that to climate action. And also a new

275
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:45,624
project that is starting here with NFRF

276
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:48,332
of a big Canadian project on Indigenous

277
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,296
knowledge and how we can think about new

278
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:54,304
narrative around AI and typically a less

279
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,592
solipsistic and individualistic way of

280
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,196
dealing with AI. So that's the two main

281
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:03,588
field of research. Can you explain what

282
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,910
you mean by less solidistic, less

283
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,260
solipsistic when it comes to AI.

284
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,304
The Californian view of AI, because the

285
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:19,192
narrative is mainly driven by us

286
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:22,212
and California right now tends to circle

287
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:25,484
around optimization profits. I mean,

288
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:29,112
even OpenAI states that AGI

289
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:32,456
is about optimizing profitable

290
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,988
human tasks. They put like profitable in

291
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:38,576
their definition. In the case of

292
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:41,568
Indigenous systems of knowledge, we are

293
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,170
more talking about community

294
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,976
sustainability. And the

295
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,764
view already only in the application is

296
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:53,044
less individualistic. But also in the

297
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:57,124
cognitive science point of view, we have

298
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:59,364
the outcore computationalism that could

299
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:02,196
say the brain is just like a computer in

300
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:05,904
a very restrictive sense. And so AI,

301
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,384
like, typically those transformers that

302
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:12,680
are massively used right now are kind of

303
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,540
like brain in a VAT in a very silicon

304
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,136
sense, while we are embodied systems

305
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:23,896
that are constituted by our interaction

306
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,928
with others. And so, in a way, how we

307
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:28,012
can think about artificial intelligence

308
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,392
in this kind of more co constitutive way

309
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:34,124
and through a developmental and cultural

310
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:37,888
lens. Okay, now, speaking of the

311
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:40,676
brain as a computer, we frequently hear

312
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:42,388
in these circles the brain as a

313
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:45,652
predictive machine. So where does this,

314
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,376
the quote unquote brain as a predictive

315
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:50,164
machine have its limits? And also, is

316
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,656
that to be interpreted as implying

317
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,044
conscious experience is a predictive

318
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:57,672
machine as well? And if not, why not?

319
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:00,584
So I think, Karl, you'd be a great

320
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:02,548
person to start this off, and then we'll

321
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,930
go around the table again.

322
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,528
Yeah, I was mindful of Mao's

323
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,556
presentation the past half hour and the

324
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,220
notion of temporal thickness.

325
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,008
I'm sure that's got a lot to do with the

326
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,088
necessary conditions for the kind of

327
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:20,956
consciousness. I'm guessing you're

328
00:17:20,988 --> 00:17:23,216
referring to that freedom from the

329
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:26,764
moment. And if one reads prediction

330
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,110
in its sort of psychological or

331
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,652
protension nature in terms

332
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,956
of being able to predict what will

333
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:41,188
happen in the future. I think that's

334
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,720
going to be sort of a key bright line

335
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,560
between things that do not possess

336
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,272
certain kind of sentience and things

337
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:54,632
that do. And that bright line just rests

338
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:58,124
basically upon well, from perspective of

339
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,072
active inference having a generative

340
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:03,484
model that includes the consequences of

341
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:06,336
your own actions in the future. So just

342
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,512
by having consequences you're now

343
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,970
talking about the future and

344
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,776
the consequences in the future now

345
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:17,584
become random variables. Therefore you

346
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:20,064
have to infer them. Which leads you

347
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,636
directly to the notion of planning as

348
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,764
inference, which means that bright line

349
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,524
is just a difference between things that

350
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,636
plan and do not plan. And I

351
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:30,896
would guess that that's where you

352
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:33,304
probably want to start in terms of

353
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:37,320
foregrounding the role of prediction as

354
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,192
being an aspect of

355
00:18:41,326 --> 00:18:44,156
self organization and its sort of

356
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:46,572
reading under active inference that

357
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,704
characterizes conscious things from non

358
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:51,676
conscious things, namely the ability to

359
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,470
plan. Does that make sense?

360
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,608
I have follow up questions. We'll get to

361
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:01,600
them at some point, but for now, Anna,

362
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,696
do you have any comments on that and

363
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,680
Bert as well afterward?

364
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,204
Well, I'm new to this field so I'm just

365
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,156
familiarizing myself even with the

366
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:16,964
language. But I can respond to the

367
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,784
question. The brain is a predictive

368
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:21,524
machine in terms of the work that I do

369
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:22,616
clinically and the kind of

370
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:25,316
psychopathology that I see when I'm

371
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,320
working with patients,

372
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,616
I work primarily with narrative, the

373
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,184
stories that they tell about their

374
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,504
lives. And one of the recurring themes

375
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:37,452
I've seen through my work is that when

376
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:40,364
patients tell stories in which they are

377
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,444
perpetually the victims of other

378
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,270
people's actions or the world,

379
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,544
that tends to be a predictive model for

380
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:51,104
them so that they will then go out into

381
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:54,240
the world and unconsciously create

382
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,304
scenarios which will perpetuate their

383
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:58,916
victimhood. And that part of getting

384
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:01,812
into wellness is to stop seeing

385
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,676
themselves as entirely the victim of

386
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:06,724
other people or circumstance, instead

387
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:10,304
begin to appreciate what they contribute

388
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,836
to their life problems. So I guess when

389
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,568
I think of the limits of the brain as a

390
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:17,370
predictive machine, I think in some ways

391
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,896
one of the big limits is that it's a

392
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,104
very powerful predictive machine that

393
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:25,660
actually allows us to subsequently shape

394
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,716
what actually happens to us and or our

395
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,716
perceptions of what happens to us,

396
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:34,264
which then can perpetuate a false

397
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:37,052
narrative. And I'll just give one small

398
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:40,464
example from my own life. I've had my

399
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:42,336
conflicts with my mother and one of my

400
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,112
beefs about her is that she's a very

401
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,576
poor communicator and that whenever I

402
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:48,556
email her I either get a cryptic

403
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,756
response or no response at all and it

404
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,524
drives me crazy. And about five years

405
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,924
ago she sent an email, asked me some

406
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,444
questions, I wrote her back and

407
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:00,964
responded and it was clear to me that

408
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,904
that required yet a response from her

409
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,688
which I never got. And that then

410
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,328
perpetuated my narrative about her as a

411
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,472
very poor communicator and many other

412
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,824
negative things. And then about three

413
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:14,884
months after I sent that email, I found

414
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:18,556
the email in my draft box. So I

415
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,524
had never actually responded to my

416
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,204
mother's email. I hadn't actually sent

417
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:25,644
the email. And that was, for me, just a

418
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:28,544
personal, wonderful example of the ways

419
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:32,028
in which our actions

420
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,792
can actually be

421
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:39,172
manipulated to support our

422
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:42,496
models and perpetuate falsehoods

423
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,710
about the world that we live in.

424
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,180
Right. And I have a quick question,

425
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,196
Bert, just for Anna before we get to

426
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:51,744
you. So you use the word narrative

427
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,364
there. How are you defining the word

428
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,496
narrative? Is it the same as model? Is

429
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:57,464
it a sequence of events? Like, what is

430
00:21:57,502 --> 00:22:00,216
the specific definition of narrative? I

431
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:01,784
never really thought about it in those

432
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,056
terms. But when I talk about narrative,

433
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:07,164
I'm talking about the

434
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,924
stories that people tell about their

435
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:11,470
lives, because that's sort of my data

436
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,496
and also about models, because what I've

437
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,448
discovered about self narrative is it's

438
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:20,336
not just a way to organize the past. It

439
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:22,512
also becomes a roadmap for the future.

440
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:25,056
That's the language that I use, but I

441
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,172
see it maps very nicely onto Ural's

442
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:31,952
language of modeling the world. I see.

443
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:33,510
Professor DeVries, please.

444
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,112
Yeah, it's clear that the ability

445
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:41,504
to predict is the essence of intelligent

446
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:44,596
decision making. Yeah, I have a

447
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:46,088
different background. Right. I'm not a

448
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:47,704
psychiatrist, so I think about these

449
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,576
things in different way. The thing that

450
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:51,272
I think about when I think about

451
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:54,244
prediction is I would assume that brain

452
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:57,452
predicts far ahead, that things

453
00:22:57,506 --> 00:23:00,104
get less accurate. Right. If I predict

454
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:02,220
that I want to go three quarters around

455
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,076
a roundabout. I don't care about the

456
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:06,908
centimeter where my car goes when I'm

457
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:09,216
around there, I just want to get in the

458
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,936
right lane. And I would assume that the

459
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,504
brain doesn't takes less computations if

460
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,520
you care about things less precisely.

461
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,030
But that's very hard in a computer.

462
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,430
This is what kind of kills us,

463
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,364
I think, in our current way of

464
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,876
implementing active inference. When we

465
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:34,516
want to predict a deep hat, we don't

466
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,772
care about the accuracy, but we don't

467
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,272
know how to do it much cheaper when

468
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:43,768
things are less accurate. And so that's

469
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:46,590
a problem that we need to be working on.

470
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,036
It might be a key to building or to

471
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,196
scaling up active entrance agents if we

472
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:58,736
can actually compute messages that

473
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:01,344
we want to know that we don't care

474
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:03,696
about, if they are less precise, that we

475
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:05,776
also spend much less computation on

476
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,092
them. Thank you.

477
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:10,580
Now, Professor Kaufman.

478
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,492
I am not a professor, but I'll answer

479
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:18,576
anyway. Can just call me Rafa.

480
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:22,004
Rafa. Yeah. So there's

481
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:23,992
so many really interesting avenues here,

482
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,616
and it's not often that I get the

483
00:24:26,638 --> 00:24:28,008
pleasure of discussing this kind of

484
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:32,100
stuff with this kind of diverse crowd.

485
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,004
But I've been interested in

486
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,724
these questions for a pretty long time.

487
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:43,630
And I think what comes to mind is

488
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,120
how active inference at the lens,

489
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,370
for instance, it enables us to

490
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,164
get another sense of what nondualist

491
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:00,564
views on consciousness are saying when

492
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:04,496
they get us experientially to notice

493
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:05,764
the difference. Between what we actually

494
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:08,644
perceive and between the different

495
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:11,544
various different processes or things

496
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,512
that are going on in our head and our

497
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:16,344
tendency to lump them all together into

498
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,576
the same okay. This is my

499
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,690
experience that I'm immersed in.

500
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,384
So noticing being able to notice

501
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:31,116
the difference between the

502
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:34,396
process of perceiving and acting and to

503
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,336
an extent, it's automated, and the

504
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:38,016
narrative or the various narratives that

505
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,328
are going on in parallel in

506
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:42,896
my head, whether I'm aware of them or

507
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:46,560
not. And our ability

508
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,516
to just put kind of seemingly arbitrary

509
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,148
manner levels on top of it, to try to

510
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:56,144
make sense of it all and to force

511
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:57,664
that experience of having multiple

512
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:59,524
narratives and multiple framings going

513
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:02,024
on at the same time make sense of that

514
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:02,650
experience.

515
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,464
In a. Way that aligns with our

516
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,184
presuppositions about how things are.

517
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,530
So I think that's super interesting.

518
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,260
I also want to highlight that this

519
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,636
view of consciousness as being kind of

520
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,924
defined by having a narrative or an

521
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:25,292
internal model that's about self or that

522
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,848
at least is about self. And that leads,

523
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:30,220
as Karl said, to planning this inference

524
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,744
that's actually, like, super

525
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:34,290
deflationary in a way that people are

526
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,520
not used to thinking about exciting.

527
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,132
It's opening the doors to all sorts of

528
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,952
exciting interdisciplinary conversations

529
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,516
to be had on the basis of at least, I

530
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,460
feel like, better, less talking past

531
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,328
each other than we've ever had. So I'm

532
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,696
excited about that. And how is it

533
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:56,164
that you're using the word deflationary

534
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:58,216
there, Karl? I remember I asked you

535
00:26:58,238 --> 00:26:59,604
about that when we had our podcast

536
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:02,152
together. But Rafael, similar question.

537
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,236
So you said deflationary view. When we

538
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:07,756
have narratives of self, do you mean us

539
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:09,356
to something that consciousness is much

540
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,470
more than sorry. Much,

541
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,652
yeah. It's not necessarily much less

542
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:18,668
than in the subjective sense, but it's

543
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:22,432
perhaps much less than in the

544
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:26,576
scientific sense. So one example of not

545
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:28,592
saying exactly that, but maybe something

546
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,644
close to what Daniel Dennett calls

547
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,544
hetero phenomenology, which is basically

548
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,784
the statement that the sum of what one

549
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,984
can say scientifically about

550
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:41,610
consciousness is is

551
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,144
equal to what? Can be studied and

552
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:49,124
modeled and theorized and communicated

553
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:52,196
and learned and agreed upon on the basis

554
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:54,088
of objective data about what people,

555
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,844
including you, but also other people say

556
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,740
about their experience and, of course,

557
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,144
what can be measured. Up neuro,

558
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:02,812
correlates and whatever. Which is not

559
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:06,088
the same as not necessarily the same as

560
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:08,656
our experience of what we think is our

561
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:11,052
direct experience of being conscious.

562
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:13,730
Right. So one way to look at it is that

563
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,216
the science of consciousness doesn't

564
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,524
necessarily have to put the primacy on

565
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:23,396
people. For instance, people saying they

566
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:26,964
have qualia, that we thought in that

567
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:29,110
sense it's deflationary. Right.

568
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,112
You have to explain why people believe

569
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,112
they have qualia, not why people have

570
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,688
qualia because it's not necessarily a

571
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:39,770
scientific truth that people have.

572
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,880
Right, Professor Dumas.

573
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,036
Yes. Well, on the limits of brain as

574
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,260
predictive machine, well, we should be

575
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,816
always careful to not move from one map

576
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:55,996
territory fallacy to another one for

577
00:28:56,018 --> 00:29:00,280
sure. So we need to be skeptics

578
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,280
and avoid to refine the methods. And

579
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,104
well, this World symposium show how this

580
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:10,320
metaphor is super useful and fruitful,

581
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,560
but I can see like two main limits

582
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,756
or at least things where we should be

583
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,070
careful. So following what

584
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,976
Professor Lemke said in psychiatry, I

585
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:29,256
think the looping effects and

586
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:33,064
the way people picture themselves can

587
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:36,924
be very unpredictable. And so the

588
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:40,556
way we think about the brain as

589
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,000
a predictive machine think prediction

590
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,880
for patients would have different

591
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,472
signification of what we mean by

592
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,904
predictive machines in the context of

593
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:54,690
active inference and in general. Also,

594
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,268
I can see that certain psychologists

595
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,724
or anthropologists would have a big

596
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:05,696
appeal all of a sudden for active

597
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:07,488
inference and free energy principles,

598
00:30:07,584 --> 00:30:10,688
but taking the words as

599
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:12,984
directly what they think the word mean,

600
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,376
where we need to be careful in the way

601
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,520
to communicate it. And typically

602
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,652
following also what Professor Debris

603
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:25,372
said about prediction as being super

604
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:27,950
important for decision making, I think

605
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,840
we should be careful about the weirdness

606
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,552
of cognitive science and how it doesn't

607
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:39,484
necessarily expand to non Western

608
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:42,592
educated industrialized country, where

609
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:45,024
maybe the cultural value is not about

610
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:47,664
optimization of your decision making or

611
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:51,104
your profit. And so that's the first

612
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,356
thing where I think we should be

613
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:54,964
careful. It's more like a matter of how

614
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:56,932
to communicate the theory in that case,

615
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:59,104
not necessarily a limit of the theory

616
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:02,810
itself, but the second one is

617
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,472
about the equivalents or not with

618
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,170
other. Like,

619
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,820
I can see we had Mahault

620
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,420
Albasan talking about category theory.

621
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,196
And I'm very curious about right now

622
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:25,196
among the different frameworks that are

623
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:29,024
out there, how can we define what is

624
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:31,680
equivalent or not with active inference

625
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,144
to be able to see those limits? Maybe we

626
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:38,124
are leaving what happened with quantum

627
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:42,416
mechanics in the early 20th

628
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,112
century with different interpretation,

629
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:46,096
with different tools to model quantum

630
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:48,016
mechanics, and here with artificial

631
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:49,696
intelligence and cognitive neuroscience,

632
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:52,536
we have also all those frameworks. And I

633
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,304
think the limitation would be then to

634
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:57,544
not take this interpretation as the only

635
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,808
one, but try to have a cross talk and a

636
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:04,344
differential diagnosis of which one is

637
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:06,430
the best for explaining what.

638
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,804
Okay, now my role is the moderator, but

639
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,804
I would like you all to speak to one

640
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,292
another. So I'm going to ask a question

641
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:17,724
that will serve as well. You each will

642
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:19,656
speak on it, but as the other person is

643
00:32:19,698 --> 00:32:21,584
speaking sorry, as the other people are

644
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,568
speaking, just think, okay, is there a

645
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,976
question that I have or is there a

646
00:32:24,998 --> 00:32:27,680
comment that I have? So the question is

647
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,160
what are some of the recent advancements

648
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,536
or breakthroughs in your respective

649
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:33,296
fields that you find particularly

650
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:37,264
promising and well recent,

651
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:41,604
let's say 2020 till now so

652
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,248
we'll start off with Raphael you're

653
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,780
smiling and you look like. You'Re

654
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,704
champion I was thinking what is my

655
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:48,890
field? Right? Because.

656
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,376
We'Re very much in

657
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:56,404
the last mile of applying the wonderful

658
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:59,900
stuff that y'all come up with and making

659
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,540
it useful on the so

660
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,652
I'm extraordinarily excited about

661
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:09,452
research like what Bird is doing.

662
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:12,748
And I

663
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:16,348
feel like, as Gion was saying, we're

664
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:20,530
also starting to see some convergence on

665
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,152
different ways

666
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:28,724
to get. At. Least the same

667
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:30,704
shape of answers and in some cases,

668
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:35,480
even to the same result.

669
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,952
So one example of this is work

670
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:43,408
that Chris Fields,

671
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:46,444
Karl and others have been doing on the

672
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:50,572
quantum basically

673
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,620
explaining quantum information theory

674
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,492
and how it relates to the free energy

675
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:57,664
principle. Looking at the free energy

676
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,880
principle as the classical limit of

677
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,388
quantum information theory and I don't

678
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:06,464
pretend to understand all of it, but as

679
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,268
somebody who is coming from a quantum

680
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:11,636
physics background just being alive to

681
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,876
see this kind of conversions happening

682
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:17,556
which as I mean, as Guillaume said,

683
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:19,972
we've been at this business of post

684
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:22,052
classical what the hell is going on for

685
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:25,096
over a century now and it's nice to be

686
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:27,784
at a time where again we're starting to

687
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:31,316
talk less past each other and that's

688
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,888
from a theoretical perspective, from a

689
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:34,764
practical perspective, I think just

690
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:36,412
finding that we have all the building

691
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:41,820
blocks to create fast,

692
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:42,940
interpretable,

693
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,440
reliable and aligned decision making

694
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,404
systems which includes AI systems,

695
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:54,896
autonomous systems that have all those

696
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,984
characteristics and that it turns out

697
00:34:58,022 --> 00:34:59,024
that all the things that the

698
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:01,296
reinforcement learning and deep net

699
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:02,756
neural networks people talk were very

700
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:05,268
hard or impossible are sort of in the

701
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:08,676
realm of what we can do looking at

702
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:10,736
things from an active inference lens and

703
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,076
vice versa. A lot of things that active

704
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:16,616
inference models have incorporated so

705
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:19,224
far, it turns out if you toss in a

706
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:23,130
neural network approximator here and

707
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,128
borrow some other massively parallel

708
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:29,736
computation techniques, it also becomes

709
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,460
feasible. So it's converging.

710
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,136
Yeah. For me, what's remarkable is

711
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:39,776
that there's so many domains of what we

712
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,888
thought was exclusively human or would

713
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:45,200
be exclusively human for decades that

714
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,736
in just the past couple years robots or

715
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:51,364
computers seem to be just as good, if

716
00:35:51,402 --> 00:35:54,708
not exceeding us. And I don't know if

717
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:56,404
that's promising or worrisome, but

718
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:59,652
anyhow Karl, please, if you don't mind

719
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:00,928
answering the question. And then we'll

720
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:03,380
go. Anna then Bert and then Dumas.

721
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,096
Actually, just reflecting upon one

722
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:11,576
of your observations I think it's very

723
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:14,110
difficult to identify one thing.

724
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,830
In a sense,

725
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,924
what is impressive is the diversity of

726
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:23,576
advances and applications.

727
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,156
And I just say that because that's what

728
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:28,732
I was thinking over the past 6 hours,

729
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,240
just listening to your amazing

730
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,896
presentation after presentation and just

731
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:36,864
noting how diverse and yet

732
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,012
there's this common thread, this common

733
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,236
commitment, basically stating our

734
00:36:41,258 --> 00:36:44,484
curiosity and using the tools that

735
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:46,900
naturalize, that kind of sense making,

736
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,004
curious behavior and communication that

737
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,116
inherit from sort of either maths or

738
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:55,624
category theory or as Ralph notes now,

739
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:57,608
quantum information theory. But just to

740
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:58,856
pick up on a couple of things which are

741
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:00,728
relevant to this conversation. So the

742
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:05,176
work with Chris Fields, it sounds lovely

743
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,848
and exciting to bring quantum mechanics

744
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:10,728
into active inference,

745
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,604
but that's not the move that I think

746
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:14,984
Chris is really wanting to champion.

747
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:17,056
The move, I think, is something that

748
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:19,376
we've all been addressing in one way or

749
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:22,764
another, which is leveraging the scale

750
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:26,160
free aspects of this principled

751
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,584
approach to self organization and

752
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,524
hopefully self organization to some kind

753
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:33,780
of generalized synchrony.

754
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,612
So that's where the quantum information

755
00:37:36,746 --> 00:37:38,992
theory gets into the game. It is scale

756
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,708
free. And indeed, he will go further and

757
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:42,424
say it's completely background free and

758
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:46,088
everything is constructed. So I think

759
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:48,904
that's a lovely move, because once

760
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:50,536
you've gone scale free, you then start

761
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,936
to ask deep questions about how you

762
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,324
couple one scale to another scale. And

763
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,316
in a sense, ecosystems is just that.

764
00:37:58,418 --> 00:38:01,660
How do the denizens of an ecosystem,

765
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,364
how is it constituted? How is it co

766
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:05,836
constructed? What is the structure of

767
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:07,596
it? These are all questions about how

768
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,888
one scale links to another scale. So I

769
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:11,372
think there have been lots of advances

770
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:13,312
in that direction in many, many

771
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:16,144
different fronts. And you can read that

772
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:18,128
either in terms of coupling, difference

773
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,584
of spatial or spatial

774
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,304
scales, but probably more importantly,

775
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,724
sort of temporal scales. And you see

776
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,710
that wherever you look,

777
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,240
you'll just come back to what do you

778
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,288
mean by a narrative? It is exactly I

779
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:38,920
think, as I said, it's just a plan.

780
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,720
It's just a story. But notice the story

781
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,184
has a temporal aspect to it. I have

782
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,520
narratives about being a good person,

783
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,092
being a good father, being a good

784
00:38:48,146 --> 00:38:50,604
scientist. I also have narratives about

785
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:53,164
I want my cup of coffee, or I have to go

786
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:56,028
look after the I don't, but Ralph has to

787
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,196
go look after the child. So we've

788
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:01,344
all got narratives at very, very

789
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,216
different timescales. And of course, if

790
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,436
you're I just came back to Bert's

791
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,256
example of I'm an autonomous vehicle and

792
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,436
I'm sentient and we're five years into

793
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,004
the future, and I have to drive around

794
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,884
the roundabout. What temporal scale and

795
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:18,004
what kind of temporal course grading to

796
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,324
define the narratives necessary with

797
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:22,744
narratives would be appropriate for that

798
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:29,144
kind of situation and the

799
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:30,520
ensuing planning.

800
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,044
Short answer to your question. I think

801
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,140
there have been many, many advances.

802
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,548
I think what they've had in common is

803
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,804
basically transcending either different

804
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,312
domains, but in particular different

805
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:51,216
scales of application. I also agree with

806
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,824
the notion. Well, another I think,

807
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:57,376
important and pragmatic advance is

808
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,156
something that Bert mentioned, which is

809
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:02,356
democratization of this technology. I

810
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:05,124
think Ralph also hinted at this is the

811
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,860
time you start using this for the common

812
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,884
good. So.

813
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:14,592
I think things like RX infer

814
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:18,024
and PMDP. And I didn't know about

815
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:20,296
the Gaia project, but it sounds as

816
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,656
though there's been great advances there

817
00:40:21,678 --> 00:40:23,256
as well. So this kind of

818
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:24,924
democratization, I think, is really

819
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:26,744
important, this sort of socialization

820
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:29,884
where everybody can play and start to

821
00:40:29,922 --> 00:40:32,348
sort of not talk past each other. I

822
00:40:32,354 --> 00:40:35,564
think that's a very

823
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,416
important advance. And did you say the

824
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,300
word scale invariance or scale

825
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,484
independence? I said scale invariant.

826
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:45,136
I actually said scale free, and I

827
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:46,290
shouldn't have done that.

828
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,492
I said scale free. So the idea

829
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:55,604
that you can apply exactly the same

830
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:58,276
mechanics and literally, for example,

831
00:40:58,378 --> 00:41:00,452
say, from Bert's perspective, the same

832
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:03,048
kind of message passing at different

833
00:41:03,134 --> 00:41:06,504
space time scales or at

834
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:08,196
different levels in a hierarchical

835
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,720
model. So I've actually got a question

836
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,520
for Bert in terms of reactive message

837
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,364
passing, because reactive means that

838
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:20,412
you don't have to prescribe the

839
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:24,216
scheduling, but in addressing

840
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,304
the problems or the issues that

841
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:29,424
entailed, by having to specify the

842
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:31,968
scheduling of talking or of message

843
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:36,060
passing, you're bound

844
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,690
to deal with time.

845
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,540
And in a scale invariant

846
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,216
context, or nested with nested scales,

847
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:48,244
for example, you have to deal with the

848
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:51,396
separation of temporal scales. So I

849
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:52,404
think there's going to be a very

850
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,120
important generic question, which

851
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,104
technically Bert will have been thinking

852
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,616
about furiously for the past few years.

853
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:00,248
But I think implicitly, we're all going

854
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:02,650
to have to be addressing soon, which is,

855
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,844
how do you put the timing of your

856
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,956
messages when you make a move or when

857
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:14,316
you listen to a patient, or when

858
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:16,556
you actually pass a message on a

859
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:20,448
Factograph? How are we going to

860
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,624
be able to put the separation of

861
00:42:22,662 --> 00:42:26,304
timescales into the architecture in a

862
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,656
way that speaks to this scale?

863
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:31,316
Invariance the Gear project, for

864
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:34,992
example, how do you integrate live feed

865
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:39,280
from traffic flow sensors

866
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,040
with fluctuations in the climate?

867
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,632
This kind of data comes at very, very

868
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:49,496
different temporal scales and yet has to

869
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:54,616
be assimilated and modeled in

870
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,972
a way that also, I think, has to know

871
00:42:58,046 --> 00:42:59,916
due courtesy to that separation of

872
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:03,196
temporal scales. Bert, could you please

873
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:04,716
recapitulate the question for the

874
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:07,390
audience and then begin to answer it?

875
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,036
Okay, yeah. The issue is active

876
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:16,272
instance agents are nested agents, and

877
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:20,560
the higher levels supposed to operate

878
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,140
on a larger temporal scale,

879
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,076
but they are also working at

880
00:43:27,098 --> 00:43:30,244
a lower resolution. If you look far

881
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:32,228
ahead, you don't care as much about

882
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:34,932
precision, not at a centimeter level.

883
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:37,096
When I go around about, I don't care at

884
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,848
the centimeter where I land, but for the

885
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:42,216
next few milliseconds, I do care because

886
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:43,604
it may mean the difference between

887
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,310
getting in the ditch or not.

888
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,116
So the higher level, I want to look very

889
00:43:51,138 --> 00:43:53,356
deep ahead, but I don't want to send

890
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:56,864
every millisecond a message to go to

891
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:59,730
look, let's say, a minute ahead.

892
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,536
So I need to space it out a lot, but

893
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,148
then I may miss things. So preferably

894
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,192
you would just send inaccurate messages.

895
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:12,596
But that only works if you actually have

896
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:15,812
a method to also, let's say,

897
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:18,896
use less computational power to compute

898
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:21,368
a less accurate message. And we're not

899
00:44:21,454 --> 00:44:23,050
good at that yet.

900
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,176
What we are thinking about is there's a

901
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:30,936
new field or a new field, but there's a

902
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,408
field called probabilistic numerics

903
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,052
where we are used in

904
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:39,612
math to just compute everything very

905
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:44,044
precisely or as precise as possible and

906
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:46,024
do not care about how much computation

907
00:44:46,072 --> 00:44:49,212
we spend on it. So in probabilistic

908
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:53,088
numerics, I hope we can leverage this

909
00:44:53,254 --> 00:44:56,656
for message computations. I would like

910
00:44:56,678 --> 00:44:59,990
to spend, let's say, proportionally less

911
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,796
computational power on the accuracy of

912
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:06,724
a message. One way possibly would be to

913
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:09,120
consider a message a latent variable

914
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,090
that has uncertainty by itself.

915
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,080
But I don't have a totally clear answer

916
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,984
for Karl because we haven't solved that

917
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:22,776
either. But there is a

918
00:45:22,798 --> 00:45:26,492
problem in, let's say, what we do on our

919
00:45:26,546 --> 00:45:30,060
computers were so completely different

920
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,188
from computers, let's say, from the from

921
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:37,710
the from the brain, that,

922
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,516
yeah, we are spending we're spending

923
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:43,564
just too many computations on messages

924
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:46,588
that in the end are very inaccurate.

925
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:50,036
And that's a problem in what we do on

926
00:45:50,058 --> 00:45:51,430
our computers currently.

927
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,036
Yeah. So I don't know how we go what

928
00:45:58,058 --> 00:45:59,540
you want to do with this on the higher

929
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,864
level. If you want to look maybe ten

930
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:05,928
times farther ahead and spend about the

931
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:07,640
same amount of computation on the lower

932
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,000
level, that's sort of our goal.

933
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,264
But we don't have an answer for that

934
00:46:14,302 --> 00:46:15,370
either at the moment.

935
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,684
Anna so please feel free to comment on

936
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:22,670
or ask a question to.

937
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,336
I don't I don't have anything to

938
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:29,424
contribute, unfortunately, to how

939
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:31,680
computers work. But I can tell you that

940
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,224
this idea of temporal scales is

941
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:36,224
something that we face often in our work

942
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:39,024
with patients. For example, addicted

943
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:41,744
patients are very focused on short term

944
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:45,840
rewards and, in fact, their ability

945
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,180
to control how they feel in the moment,

946
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,484
that is partially what drives the

947
00:46:50,522 --> 00:46:53,708
addiction. So when I try to adopt Ural's

948
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,800
language of minimizing surprise or

949
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,728
minimizing free entropy, that's one of

950
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:00,648
the things that people are trying to do

951
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,160
on a short term scale when they become

952
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,336
addicted. So I have a young woman who's

953
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:07,756
addicted to nitrous oxide, which has a

954
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:10,796
very fast onset of intoxication over the

955
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:13,736
order of seconds and a very fast offset,

956
00:47:13,848 --> 00:47:15,676
and she says that that's exactly what

957
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:17,164
she likes about it, because she's

958
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:20,256
controlling it second by second. So when

959
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:22,416
we work with patients to get them out of

960
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:26,160
that short temporal horizon, we actually

961
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,052
rely more and more on action and having

962
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:32,740
them change something in their lives,

963
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,784
namely abstain from their drug of choice

964
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:38,004
for long. Enough to kind of completely

965
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:41,656
reset their brains and to allow them to

966
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:44,504
see this longer temporal, because when

967
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,408
they're chasing this short control,

968
00:47:46,494 --> 00:47:48,776
they're actually not able to see

969
00:47:48,878 --> 00:47:52,196
themselves in the longer narrative arc

970
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:55,384
of their lives. So that's what comes

971
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:57,068
to mind for me. I don't think it's going

972
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,556
to be helpful to people who are trying

973
00:47:58,578 --> 00:48:01,128
to build computers, but that's the kinds

974
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,604
of interventions that I make with

975
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:05,820
humans. I have a question about that.

976
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:07,824
So you mentioned control in the short

977
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:09,984
term, and you've also mentioned that you

978
00:48:10,022 --> 00:48:14,016
study the positive effects of

979
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:16,288
having a higher power in your life or

980
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,448
surrender. Okay. I kind of gave the

981
00:48:18,454 --> 00:48:20,048
punchline away by saying surrendering to

982
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:22,308
the higher power. Where I was going was,

983
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:24,212
okay. What's the association between

984
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:26,804
seeing yourself in the largest time

985
00:48:26,842 --> 00:48:29,444
frame and a higher power? And then also

986
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:31,604
is there something that is akin to

987
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,050
giving up control when you

988
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,048
look farther and farther into the

989
00:48:37,054 --> 00:48:39,416
future? Such a great yeah, that's at the

990
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:41,384
heart of what I'm very interested in,

991
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,464
because it's a real paradox, right?

992
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:45,340
It's this kind of locus of control

993
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,184
within ourselves that really, in modern

994
00:48:48,232 --> 00:48:50,812
culture, we think is a great thing. But

995
00:48:50,866 --> 00:48:53,084
when that's taken to an extreme and one

996
00:48:53,122 --> 00:48:55,368
example of that is addictive behaviors.

997
00:48:55,464 --> 00:48:57,424
It's very bad for people and for

998
00:48:57,462 --> 00:49:01,024
communities. And so what can

999
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:03,216
pull people out of that is this kind of

1000
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:05,856
surrender to a higher power, giving up

1001
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:07,936
that locus of control, locating that

1002
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,890
locus of control outside themselves,

1003
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,110
not necessarily like in a theistic sense

1004
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,636
one of the things that they talk about

1005
00:49:15,658 --> 00:49:17,252
in Alcoholics Anonymous, for example,

1006
00:49:17,306 --> 00:49:20,244
is you don't have to believe in God.

1007
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:23,344
It's just not you. You're not driving

1008
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:25,668
it. And so I would be very curious,

1009
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:27,476
from the perspective of Ural's

1010
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:29,336
understanding of active inference and

1011
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:30,648
the free energy principle and how the

1012
00:49:30,654 --> 00:49:34,156
brain works, why is it that

1013
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,596
sort of embracing our inability to

1014
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:40,844
control what happens in our lives can

1015
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:43,176
actually be the very source of healing,

1016
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:45,676
especially embedded in this really kind

1017
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:48,704
of over controlled? I would even go so

1018
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:50,684
far as to say endemically narcissistic

1019
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:53,536
culture. I'm really curious. I don't

1020
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,808
want to take the conversation in a

1021
00:49:55,814 --> 00:49:58,044
direction please. That's a fantastic

1022
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:00,788
question. So if anyone has a comment on

1023
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:01,590
that, please.

1024
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,824
I have some thoughts, and I think

1025
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:13,088
this applies both at

1026
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,504
the personal level and at the global

1027
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:18,644
level. And I think it has to do with my

1028
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,256
quote from earlier by Edward Fulbrook

1029
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:25,280
that if you're falling from a plane,

1030
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,064
yes, maybe an altimeter and some

1031
00:50:27,102 --> 00:50:29,048
instruments might be useful, but what

1032
00:50:29,054 --> 00:50:30,584
you really need is a parachute. Right?

1033
00:50:30,622 --> 00:50:34,490
So we have this

1034
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,956
presupposition that whatever

1035
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:41,596
framing we have operating in our day to

1036
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:42,988
day is going to be, okay. This is the

1037
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:47,884
right framing. And it tends to be this

1038
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:52,444
rational, scientific framing of very

1039
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:56,012
linear cause and consequence for

1040
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:59,020
most stuff. And it turns out that even

1041
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,900
if you inspect our day to day behavior,

1042
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,356
bigger, more complicated models are not

1043
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:06,436
necessarily better, which is where we

1044
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:09,220
get the success of heuristics under

1045
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,592
bounded computation. Bounded

1046
00:51:10,656 --> 00:51:13,796
rationality. And if

1047
00:51:13,818 --> 00:51:17,168
you scale it up to 8 billion humans

1048
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:20,816
interacted in resource constrained

1049
00:51:20,848 --> 00:51:23,384
planet, a world of possibilities, but

1050
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:27,624
also of challenges. Then we

1051
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:29,690
have to drastically lower.

1052
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,356
Our. Bar for, yes, how much macro we

1053
00:51:35,378 --> 00:51:38,876
have. But also even where does

1054
00:51:39,058 --> 00:51:40,856
information gathering reach diminishing

1055
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:42,780
returns? Where does modeling reach

1056
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,504
diminishing returns? There's a whole

1057
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:48,192
literature in the business world about

1058
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:50,176
the expected value of information, how

1059
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:52,704
much you should actually invest. Also in

1060
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,484
science is also known as optimal

1061
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,430
experiment design, where basically

1062
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,064
acknowledging that you have limited

1063
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:03,844
budget in terms of how much you can act

1064
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:06,424
and how much you can probe and how much

1065
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:08,520
time you can spend thinking about stuff.

1066
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,576
And I think what we're doing when we

1067
00:52:11,598 --> 00:52:14,804
feel like, burned out or exhausted

1068
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,732
from overthinking, we're innately

1069
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:20,732
feeling that, okay, we've gone too high

1070
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:24,952
and we need to give ourselves

1071
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,284
a vacation, give ourselves some free

1072
00:52:28,322 --> 00:52:30,750
time here. I think that doing this

1073
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,816
principle in a principled way, we're

1074
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:35,308
just not just like, taking the

1075
00:52:35,314 --> 00:52:37,692
heuristics and the signals that we

1076
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:40,444
inherit from evolution, but actually

1077
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:43,184
being able to figure out collaboratively

1078
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:46,310
and with some rigor. Okay,

1079
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,484
we don't need to know exactly how many

1080
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:54,100
degrees the world is going to warm by

1081
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:58,024
2000 and 2100. In order to know that

1082
00:52:58,062 --> 00:53:00,392
maybe it's a good idea to start doing

1083
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:02,488
something about the amount of carbon in

1084
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:05,160
the atmosphere or whatever. Right? And

1085
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,812
so I think this leads to this

1086
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:11,708
idea of a real knowledge economy and of

1087
00:53:11,794 --> 00:53:13,710
things like abstraction as a service.

1088
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,104
How can you actually build

1089
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:23,200
in these kind of sophisticated,

1090
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,992
sophisticated translation layers that

1091
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:31,644
take some of this burden from ourselves

1092
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:32,864
as individuals and even as

1093
00:53:32,902 --> 00:53:35,876
organizations, right? And just put it

1094
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:38,336
out in the world as value added

1095
00:53:38,368 --> 00:53:39,990
services, which is what they are.

1096
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,060
And Guillaume, if you have any

1097
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,504
statements or questions or retorts,

1098
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:48,584
then please feel free. Yeah,

1099
00:53:48,622 --> 00:53:52,472
thanks. Now, I was still also thinking

1100
00:53:52,526 --> 00:53:54,936
about the recent breakthrough post 2020

1101
00:53:55,038 --> 00:53:56,360
in Action France.

1102
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,800
To me, there were theoretical progress

1103
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,460
that were very interesting. We heard

1104
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:07,708
already about the formalism maturity at

1105
00:54:07,714 --> 00:54:09,004
the mathematical level between

1106
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:11,820
multiscale and scale free aspects.

1107
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,064
I really liked also the development of a

1108
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:17,948
more multi agent perspective of active

1109
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,810
insurance. It's very interesting,

1110
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,880
especially like, for instance,

1111
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,916
seeing multi agent systems. We just

1112
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:29,332
heard about even society as a wall,

1113
00:54:29,386 --> 00:54:33,332
like as many as one system or many

1114
00:54:33,386 --> 00:54:37,460
as many subsystems, and how we can use

1115
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,944
maybe those formalisms to also deal with

1116
00:54:39,982 --> 00:54:42,424
policy making. That's very interesting

1117
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:46,004
venue and the emergence of norms,

1118
00:54:46,052 --> 00:54:49,996
culture and ideas also. Because one

1119
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:52,188
thing that I'm still struggling with in

1120
00:54:52,194 --> 00:54:53,996
the case of active insurance models is

1121
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:56,348
like how to get outside the

1122
00:54:56,514 --> 00:54:59,724
checkerboard. You can put a

1123
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:02,476
lot in the model, a priory,

1124
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:05,296
and how you make the model,

1125
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:07,644
creating new stuff that is not becked

1126
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:11,664
inside. At the first and on that one

1127
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:14,676
very interesting breakthrough was the

1128
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:16,116
application of active inference to

1129
00:55:16,138 --> 00:55:18,644
morphogenesis. I really like the work

1130
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,604
that has been done on that and on the

1131
00:55:21,642 --> 00:55:25,030
technical aspects. I think the two main

1132
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,856
focus that I love are all the

1133
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:30,756
deep active inference and how to scale

1134
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:32,968
up active inference because it's a

1135
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:35,640
strong limitation for the adoption of

1136
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,468
the formalism if it's not scaled enough

1137
00:55:39,634 --> 00:55:42,056
compared to other framework like deep

1138
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:45,916
learning and then the link with

1139
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:47,596
empirical data. I really like, for

1140
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:50,876
instance, the work of Ryan Smith and how

1141
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:53,584
to connect with electrophysiology and

1142
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:56,720
clinical data. And I think it's also

1143
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,384
something very important to anchor the

1144
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:03,890
theory in the real world and have

1145
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,120
falsifiability and empirical validation

1146
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,548
of those models. And what are some of

1147
00:56:10,554 --> 00:56:12,630
the applications of active inference to.

1148
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,900
So? Well, I'm not the expert here. Karl

1149
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,976
would be the best to answer that. But I

1150
00:56:21,998 --> 00:56:23,796
was referring to the work with Michael

1151
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:28,244
Levin and how a model can help to

1152
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:31,020
create a sort of embryogenesis.

1153
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,324
So maybe, Karl, you can explain better

1154
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:37,310
than me, please.

1155
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,948
I don't have a reputation for explaining

1156
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:44,624
things very clearly, but yeah,

1157
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:47,344
that's absolutely right. It was just at

1158
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:49,360
work with Michael Evan and colleagues

1159
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,936
showing that you can get quite

1160
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:57,184
expressive and bimimetic pattern

1161
00:56:57,232 --> 00:56:58,692
formation and movement of different

1162
00:56:58,746 --> 00:57:03,188
cells into an organization often

1163
00:57:03,274 --> 00:57:06,660
described in terms of morphogenesis

1164
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,436
simply by communicating

1165
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:13,896
your beliefs. So I'm coming back

1166
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:15,880
to this sort of cross cutting theme of

1167
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:18,840
communication. So if you just broadcast

1168
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,710
your beliefs and you're a little cell

1169
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,564
and there are a little ensemble of

1170
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:27,224
cells, and they all have the shared

1171
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:30,856
generative model that includes if

1172
00:57:30,898 --> 00:57:32,880
I was in this position, I would sense

1173
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,344
that. Now, they all have exactly the

1174
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:37,888
same generative model, the same

1175
00:57:37,974 --> 00:57:41,552
predictions, the same expectations, and

1176
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:44,576
they're all broadcasting their beliefs

1177
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:46,564
about where they are. And the free

1178
00:57:46,602 --> 00:57:48,804
energy minimizing solution is just when

1179
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:53,012
they're all in a place such

1180
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:55,876
that they receive signals that they

1181
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:59,464
would expect to receive when they're in

1182
00:57:59,502 --> 00:58:01,704
this place. And of course, if that is

1183
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:03,864
the same for everybody, there's only one

1184
00:58:03,902 --> 00:58:06,184
arrangement where each cell finds its

1185
00:58:06,222 --> 00:58:08,724
place. So basically, knowing your place

1186
00:58:08,862 --> 00:58:11,836
is an emergent property of making the

1187
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:15,150
world mutually predictable through,

1188
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,756
yeah, a deflationary account of

1189
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,776
morphogenesis. But Gim,

1190
00:58:22,808 --> 00:58:26,332
I thought one of your units is precision

1191
00:58:26,396 --> 00:58:28,608
psychiatry. So I thought you're going to

1192
00:58:28,614 --> 00:58:30,128
talk about precision, so I'm going to do

1193
00:58:30,134 --> 00:58:33,396
a Guillem. Now, he talked about

1194
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:34,804
morphogenesis, I'm going to talk about

1195
00:58:34,842 --> 00:58:38,576
precision. Now. I think that's

1196
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:41,300
a really nice way just to pick up on

1197
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:44,230
themes which everybody's just mentioned,

1198
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,564
in particular the pathology of

1199
00:58:46,602 --> 00:58:49,304
precision. And by precision you can read

1200
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:52,264
precision in the sense that Bert was

1201
00:58:52,302 --> 00:58:55,464
talking about in terms of do you use an

1202
00:58:55,502 --> 00:58:58,584
unsigned integer or a double? How much

1203
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,480
can I coarse grain to my numeric

1204
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,956
representation? Or you can use it in

1205
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,668
terms of coarse grading in the sense of

1206
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,224
the renormalization group chunking

1207
00:59:07,272 --> 00:59:09,596
things in hours or years as opposed to

1208
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:12,224
milliseconds and minutes. Or you can

1209
00:59:12,262 --> 00:59:15,200
look at it in terms of a statistician

1210
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,344
describing the reliability or the

1211
00:59:19,382 --> 00:59:21,648
inverse variance of a signal. And of

1212
00:59:21,654 --> 00:59:24,756
course we have to estimate that when I

1213
00:59:24,778 --> 00:59:27,092
say we I mean your agents and

1214
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,848
statisticians and act accordingly.

1215
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:34,676
And certainly in the work of

1216
00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:38,792
Ryan Smith on addiction, much of the

1217
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:41,016
sort of mathematical explanation for

1218
00:59:41,038 --> 00:59:43,864
these addictive locked in OCD like

1219
00:59:44,062 --> 00:59:47,304
phenomena rests upon a failure to

1220
00:59:47,342 --> 00:59:49,368
get that course grading that precision

1221
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:50,750
estimation right.

1222
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,324
The reason I wonder whether it be just

1223
00:59:55,362 --> 01:00:00,472
worthwhile revisiting addiction

1224
01:00:00,536 --> 01:00:02,572
and psychopathology or certainly

1225
01:00:02,626 --> 01:00:05,168
pathology of behavior from the point of

1226
01:00:05,174 --> 01:00:08,432
view of getting precision wrong and

1227
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:10,396
certainly assigning too much precision

1228
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:12,096
to low level processing, which is what

1229
01:00:12,118 --> 01:00:15,604
Bert wants to avoid doing. It just

1230
01:00:15,642 --> 01:00:19,268
strikes me that that kind of story also

1231
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:22,484
has mileage in terms of why we are

1232
01:00:22,522 --> 01:00:24,676
in a state of paralysis when it comes to

1233
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:26,736
climate change because I also noticed,

1234
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:28,196
Guillermo, that you talked about climate

1235
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:29,736
action. I've never heard that before,

1236
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:32,376
but that seems to me to be the important

1237
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:35,160
thing. Why isn't there any climate,

1238
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,476
Anna? You know, it'll be like you going

1239
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:39,996
to the clinic and finding someone with

1240
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:41,804
Parkinson's disease. Why isn't this

1241
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:42,910
person moving?

1242
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,136
And interestingly, the computational

1243
01:00:48,248 --> 01:00:51,416
explanation for Parkinson's disease is

1244
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:53,936
assigning too much precision to the

1245
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,632
evidence that you're not moving before

1246
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:59,516
you move. So if you can't ignore

1247
01:00:59,548 --> 01:01:02,064
the fact that nothing is changing, all

1248
01:01:02,102 --> 01:01:03,676
your prior beliefs, your predictions

1249
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,476
that I am going to stand up or going to

1250
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:08,068
initiate walking, don't get a looking

1251
01:01:08,154 --> 01:01:10,096
because they are immediately cancelled

1252
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:11,412
because you've assigned too much

1253
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:14,096
precision to the lower level processing.

1254
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:17,496
And I'm just wondering whether that kind

1255
01:01:17,518 --> 01:01:22,888
of pathology is exactly what

1256
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,250
Ralph is trying to reverse by having

1257
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,464
models at hand, recommendations at hand

1258
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:31,756
that provide a more coarse grained view

1259
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:33,310
of things, a deeper view.

1260
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,030
Anna, would you like to comment on?

1261
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,264
I love this idea of the pathology of

1262
01:01:43,302 --> 01:01:45,724
precision because I think it manifests

1263
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:49,424
in so many different ways not

1264
01:01:49,462 --> 01:01:52,608
just among my patient population but I

1265
01:01:52,614 --> 01:01:55,260
think it's almost like a cultural

1266
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,170
sickness, in a way.

1267
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,872
The ways in which we seem, like obsessed

1268
01:02:01,936 --> 01:02:04,976
with certain types of data and we're

1269
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:07,876
missing the big picture. So I'm going to

1270
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:09,144
think more about that. I'm going to read

1271
01:02:09,182 --> 01:02:11,624
more about it. I really appreciate the

1272
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:14,104
discussion. It's interesting for me and

1273
01:02:14,142 --> 01:02:15,720
Adam when. You'Re referring to the

1274
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,072
pathology of precision, do you mean so

1275
01:02:18,126 --> 01:02:21,384
in a more conscious sense that we're

1276
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:23,432
over evaluating something that we don't

1277
01:02:23,496 --> 01:02:27,416
need to? Whereas, Karl, you're referring

1278
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:29,436
to it in an unconscious sense like the

1279
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,336
brain is putting too much precision on

1280
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:34,428
something because in Parkinson's it's

1281
01:02:34,444 --> 01:02:36,096
not like you consciously are putting

1282
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:39,584
precision in a place. Well,

1283
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,616
I think you could look at it sort of

1284
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:43,972
like in both cases. When I think about

1285
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,884
addiction, people aren't doing it

1286
01:02:46,922 --> 01:02:49,510
consciously. It's that they really do

1287
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,596
see this as adaptive and healthy and

1288
01:02:52,618 --> 01:02:54,416
also even on some level that they can't

1289
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:57,384
do otherwise. And they're not able to

1290
01:02:57,422 --> 01:02:59,976
see the true impact of their drug use on

1291
01:02:59,998 --> 01:03:01,816
their lives. They're genuinely not able

1292
01:03:01,918 --> 01:03:04,824
to see the negative consequences. And

1293
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:07,224
that's what contributes to getting

1294
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:10,252
caught in that vortex. But I mean,

1295
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:13,656
you could also see it as part of what's

1296
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:15,724
happened culturally. Like, for example,

1297
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:17,912
the whole wellness industrial complex,

1298
01:03:17,976 --> 01:03:19,980
the way that we now count ourselves

1299
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,572
through all these different devices.

1300
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:24,716
And if we could just count our breathing

1301
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:26,384
and count our heart rate and take

1302
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,280
supplements, then we would somehow reach

1303
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:32,332
some levitating state of precise

1304
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:34,230
wellness. I don't know,

1305
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,550
this is all kind of new ideas for me.

1306
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,996
That's interesting. So you believe that

1307
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:44,084
we can be inundated with health data and

1308
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:46,384
that's detrimental to us? Oh,

1309
01:03:46,442 --> 01:03:49,576
absolutely. I see that all the time. So

1310
01:03:49,598 --> 01:03:52,328
for me, I used to have maybe I'll take

1311
01:03:52,334 --> 01:03:54,536
this out of the well, this is going out

1312
01:03:54,638 --> 01:03:56,490
live. Okay,

1313
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,210
let me figure out how to say this

1314
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,480
diplomatically. I used to have a device

1315
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,448
that would measure my heart rate, let's

1316
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:06,396
say that and my sleep. And instead of

1317
01:04:06,418 --> 01:04:08,476
improving my sleep, it led to me

1318
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:10,364
becoming obsessed with it and then

1319
01:04:10,402 --> 01:04:12,316
noticing, oh, I didn't sleep well. I

1320
01:04:12,338 --> 01:04:14,240
must not be feeling good today as well

1321
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,824
because apparently there's a high

1322
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:17,436
connection between how your sleep

1323
01:04:17,468 --> 01:04:19,776
quality and. How well you plus added to

1324
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:22,496
that the other layer that I should be

1325
01:04:22,518 --> 01:04:25,556
able to control it. Right. So with all

1326
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:28,004
of this data and information, I should

1327
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:30,132
be able to, I don't know, reduce free

1328
01:04:30,186 --> 01:04:32,144
entropy or whatever, reduce surprise,

1329
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:35,572
as you guys talk about. And I think

1330
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:38,232
that's obviously that only goes so far

1331
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:40,552
and then can actually contribute to our

1332
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:43,690
misery because why aren't we all

1333
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,450
levitating like the Buddha or whatever

1334
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,948
when we have all these tools and we can

1335
01:04:49,954 --> 01:04:53,596
pay attention to all this data? I see

1336
01:04:53,618 --> 01:04:55,468
this also with people who have

1337
01:04:55,554 --> 01:04:58,860
productivity tools. Not only that, but

1338
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:02,156
mechanical keyboards. Let's say the

1339
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:03,336
reason why I don't have a mechanical

1340
01:05:03,368 --> 01:05:04,684
keyboard, even though I think I'd love

1341
01:05:04,722 --> 01:05:08,016
it, is because I know that why the heck

1342
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,568
do I care about the clicking sound of a

1343
01:05:09,574 --> 01:05:11,888
keyboard? But if I got one, then I'd be

1344
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:12,752
like, well, what's the difference

1345
01:05:12,806 --> 01:05:14,316
between clicking sound A versus clicking

1346
01:05:14,348 --> 01:05:16,176
sound B versus clicking sound C? And I'd

1347
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,468
become obsessed with the trappings of

1348
01:05:18,474 --> 01:05:20,436
productivity that is sharpening, so

1349
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,164
called sharpening the axe rather than

1350
01:05:22,202 --> 01:05:24,564
cutting down the tree. There's this

1351
01:05:24,602 --> 01:05:26,900
phrase that is apocryphal. And it said

1352
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:29,130
it's attributed to, I think,

1353
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,528
Lincoln, which is that he'd spend 80% of

1354
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,688
his time or half the time sharpening the

1355
01:05:35,694 --> 01:05:37,320
knife than cutting the tree.

1356
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,216
And then this is just echoed in

1357
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:42,376
productivity circles, but it can't be

1358
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:44,316
the case. Why would you spend so much

1359
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:45,708
time sharpening your axe? Like, look at

1360
01:05:45,714 --> 01:05:47,352
anyone who cuts down a tree with an axe.

1361
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:49,150
Most of the time they're not doing that

1362
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,168
anyhow. So if anyone has any comments on

1363
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:57,184
what was just said, please can

1364
01:05:57,222 --> 01:06:00,736
I. Just talk what I find exciting in my

1365
01:06:00,758 --> 01:06:03,410
field about access? Sure, yes,

1366
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,056
I read it's a long time ago, but there

1367
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:10,596
was a paper and it's about that it says,

1368
01:06:10,698 --> 01:06:12,676
well, active inference is not really a

1369
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:15,220
scientific loop because it's biased.

1370
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,896
And I read that, and the

1371
01:06:19,918 --> 01:06:22,436
sound of the paper was kind of so it's

1372
01:06:22,468 --> 01:06:26,260
not good. But I think active inference

1373
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,136
is maybe not a science loop. It's an

1374
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:30,292
engineering loop because there's bias,

1375
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:32,268
and we need bias in engineering. We need

1376
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:33,644
to make stuff. We need to build stuff.

1377
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:36,236
We need to have a bias. So it's an

1378
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,988
engineering design cycle. I see that

1379
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:40,670
everywhere around me.

1380
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,624
And active inference could be a

1381
01:06:46,662 --> 01:06:49,084
complete breakthrough in in engineering.

1382
01:06:49,132 --> 01:06:52,290
Right. The fields around me

1383
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,268
are signal processing. I am myself in a

1384
01:06:55,274 --> 01:06:58,560
signal processing department

1385
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,184
or group, and everybody builds

1386
01:07:01,232 --> 01:07:04,944
algorithms. For us. In active inference

1387
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:07,048
agents, it's inference over states.

1388
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:09,672
Then the floor below me, they build

1389
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,636
control systems. Well, it's inference

1390
01:07:11,668 --> 01:07:14,872
over actions. Then other people are

1391
01:07:14,926 --> 01:07:16,356
working on machine learning. It's

1392
01:07:16,388 --> 01:07:19,476
inference over parameters. Active

1393
01:07:19,508 --> 01:07:21,548
inference could be and you like this,

1394
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:26,012
Kurt. It's a very deflationary view on

1395
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:28,284
engineering, because everything is just

1396
01:07:28,402 --> 01:07:31,490
inference. And so rather than building

1397
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,560
algorithms everywhere, if we become

1398
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,960
really good at implementing

1399
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,600
minimization, we will be

1400
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,420
able to build a great engineering design

1401
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:47,076
cycles, and we'll be engineering better

1402
01:07:47,178 --> 01:07:50,564
machines for

1403
01:07:50,602 --> 01:07:52,436
medical procedures or for other things

1404
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,596
that are important. So it has a

1405
01:07:54,618 --> 01:07:57,444
tremendous application potential in

1406
01:07:57,482 --> 01:08:00,656
engineering. In engineering,

1407
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:04,712
and I think in many fields, people have

1408
01:08:04,766 --> 01:08:06,980
sort of drifted in different directions.

1409
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,724
Control theorists have. I mean, they do

1410
01:08:09,762 --> 01:08:11,064
almost the same thing as signal

1411
01:08:11,112 --> 01:08:12,956
processing people, but they speak a

1412
01:08:12,978 --> 01:08:14,430
different language. Now.

1413
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,516
Signal processing people, it's a

1414
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:22,688
completely different group for the

1415
01:08:22,694 --> 01:08:24,224
machine learning people, but it's all

1416
01:08:24,262 --> 01:08:27,936
information processing, and this field

1417
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:29,250
can bring it together.

1418
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:37,876
But the thing is that in order to make

1419
01:08:37,898 --> 01:08:40,404
it successful in engineering, we need to

1420
01:08:40,522 --> 01:08:44,084
build an application that

1421
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:46,596
impresses. Right? It's not like a

1422
01:08:46,618 --> 01:08:49,288
TicTacToe thing. It really needs to

1423
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:51,850
impress people, needs to be better than

1424
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,024
some other control systems. But once we

1425
01:08:56,062 --> 01:08:58,160
do that, I think there is tremendous

1426
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,684
application potential because there

1427
01:09:00,722 --> 01:09:03,244
haven't been enormous breakthroughs in

1428
01:09:03,282 --> 01:09:05,084
signal processing and control. The last

1429
01:09:05,122 --> 01:09:08,136
big breakthrough, I think, was Kalmont

1430
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:10,510
filtering, and this was 1960s.

1431
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,464
It's kind of funny that the essence of

1432
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:16,224
what we do in active influence is also

1433
01:09:16,262 --> 01:09:17,600
carbon filtering.

1434
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,400
I think there's tremendous opportunities

1435
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,560
for what we do here for engineering.

1436
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,336
That's why it's exciting to me. Anna,

1437
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,684
do you mind expanding on what you said

1438
01:09:33,722 --> 01:09:36,136
about acting? And therapists should be

1439
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,552
helping their patients with that. Oh,

1440
01:09:38,686 --> 01:09:40,664
sure. Just so. I mean, one of my

1441
01:09:40,702 --> 01:09:43,396
critiques of mental health treatment

1442
01:09:43,428 --> 01:09:48,676
today is that there's

1443
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:50,636
not enough encouragement of patients to

1444
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:53,276
actually go and act differently in the

1445
01:09:53,298 --> 01:09:54,940
world as a way of gathering data.

1446
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,164
Instead, it often ends up being kind of

1447
01:09:57,202 --> 01:10:01,064
this world building between therapists

1448
01:10:01,112 --> 01:10:03,592
and patients, not necessarily ultimately

1449
01:10:03,736 --> 01:10:05,456
adaptive in the world. So I was really

1450
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:07,296
just kind of responding to what Raft was

1451
01:10:07,318 --> 01:10:08,688
saying, that we need to act in the

1452
01:10:08,694 --> 01:10:12,752
world. I think that's more true now in

1453
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:14,900
modern rich nations than ever before

1454
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,000
because we are so incredibly sedentary

1455
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,456
and interacting. Of course we're

1456
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:21,444
interacting with a virtual world, and

1457
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:24,964
that's good and bad. But I

1458
01:10:25,002 --> 01:10:27,496
think we need to be actually acting in

1459
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:28,250
the world.

1460
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,592
And so there's different forms of

1461
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,512
therapy. As you know, there's talk

1462
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:37,444
therapy, and then there's also cognitive

1463
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:39,416
behavioral therapy or psychotherapy and

1464
01:10:39,438 --> 01:10:41,864
sort of talk therapy. But cognitive

1465
01:10:41,912 --> 01:10:43,276
behavioral therapy, as far as I

1466
01:10:43,298 --> 01:10:45,788
understand, focuses on the actions. Is

1467
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:48,972
that incorrect? It also

1468
01:10:49,026 --> 01:10:51,016
focuses on model buildings. On the

1469
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:54,272
cognition, again,

1470
01:10:54,326 --> 01:10:56,576
treating addiction. You're not going to

1471
01:10:56,598 --> 01:10:58,476
really get that far with cognitive

1472
01:10:58,508 --> 01:11:00,076
behavioral therapy or anything that's

1473
01:11:00,108 --> 01:11:02,172
focused on just emotions and cognitions.

1474
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:05,600
People have to go out and actually try

1475
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,364
stop using their stopping their

1476
01:11:07,402 --> 01:11:09,024
substance or their addictive behaviors

1477
01:11:09,072 --> 01:11:11,428
and gather data from that experience and

1478
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,430
then come back and process it.

1479
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,556
So, Anna, in your field and this

1480
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:19,816
question will go to everyone, but in

1481
01:11:19,838 --> 01:11:21,944
your field and what you study, where is

1482
01:11:21,982 --> 01:11:23,688
the largest gap that you would like to

1483
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:26,936
see closed? Well, I mean, we're facing a

1484
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:29,804
huge mental health crisis now. We have

1485
01:11:29,842 --> 01:11:32,060
more and more young people coming in

1486
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:34,920
with depression, anxiety, suicidality,

1487
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,956
addictions of all sorts. And these are

1488
01:11:36,978 --> 01:11:39,244
not necessarily people who are

1489
01:11:39,282 --> 01:11:42,448
struggling by virtue of trauma or

1490
01:11:42,614 --> 01:11:44,544
socioeconomic disparity. These are

1491
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:46,192
people who have really privileged lives

1492
01:11:46,246 --> 01:11:49,696
in many instances. So it's really a

1493
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:52,816
puzzle what is going on for people. And

1494
01:11:52,838 --> 01:11:56,324
I think a big part of it is the fact

1495
01:11:56,362 --> 01:11:58,032
that people are not having embodied

1496
01:11:58,096 --> 01:12:00,372
experiences. They're not having

1497
01:12:00,426 --> 01:12:04,292
experiences in the world. And also

1498
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:06,630
the experiences that they are having are

1499
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,872
these kinds of very quick fixes and fast

1500
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:11,880
pleasures.

1501
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,020
Are you noticing? I think the co created

1502
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,600
sort of models through healthier

1503
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,700
communication that allow people to feel

1504
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,116
part of a community and also to have

1505
01:12:25,218 --> 01:12:27,836
truthful co created narratives. Trying

1506
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:31,096
to use the language here, I think that's

1507
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:33,468
really important. So, for example, one

1508
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:34,988
of the things Bert mentioned, what he's

1509
01:12:35,004 --> 01:12:36,028
excited about? One of the things I'm

1510
01:12:36,044 --> 01:12:37,468
excited about in the field of addiction

1511
01:12:37,484 --> 01:12:40,496
medicine is mutual support and the

1512
01:12:40,518 --> 01:12:42,796
proliferation of things like Alcoholics

1513
01:12:42,828 --> 01:12:44,804
Anonymous, but also other mutual help

1514
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:46,452
groups, a lot of them existing now

1515
01:12:46,506 --> 01:12:49,910
online. And the way that people are

1516
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,376
together creating healthier narratives

1517
01:12:53,488 --> 01:12:56,548
and acted together to counteract a

1518
01:12:56,554 --> 01:12:58,088
lot of the unhealthy narratives that I

1519
01:12:58,094 --> 01:12:59,684
think are driving a lot of decision

1520
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:03,464
making today. I wanted

1521
01:13:03,502 --> 01:13:05,752
to know, is there a correlation between

1522
01:13:05,806 --> 01:13:07,672
the rise in mental health or, sorry,

1523
01:13:07,726 --> 01:13:09,884
mental illness or mental health issues,

1524
01:13:10,002 --> 01:13:13,516
whatever we want to call it, and a

1525
01:13:13,538 --> 01:13:17,196
certain trait of people? Is it

1526
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:20,188
affecting the population the same?

1527
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:23,196
So the whole population is raised 20% in

1528
01:13:23,218 --> 01:13:24,672
terms of how many mental health issues

1529
01:13:24,726 --> 01:13:26,636
they have per year? Or is it affecting

1530
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,368
people who deal with abstractions more

1531
01:13:28,374 --> 01:13:29,676
and more? So, for instance, we're

1532
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,992
talking over zoom and some people study

1533
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:35,216
abstractions just like us. And then

1534
01:13:35,238 --> 01:13:38,532
there are some people whose work it is

1535
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:42,212
to do something physical like running or

1536
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,608
swim? Is it affecting everyone equally

1537
01:13:44,704 --> 01:13:46,116
or are you noticing that there's some

1538
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:48,948
broad trend? Well, the broad trends that

1539
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:50,948
are out there are just correlational,

1540
01:13:51,044 --> 01:13:53,208
but the more time that people spend in

1541
01:13:53,214 --> 01:13:54,856
the virtual world, the more likely they

1542
01:13:54,878 --> 01:13:56,756
are to suffer from depression, anxiety

1543
01:13:56,788 --> 01:13:58,330
and other mental health problems.

1544
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,240
People haven't really been able to

1545
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,292
narrow that down to specific content,

1546
01:14:03,426 --> 01:14:05,036
but they have been able to save just the

1547
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:06,908
sheer amount of time that spending that

1548
01:14:06,914 --> 01:14:09,084
you're spending online increases your

1549
01:14:09,122 --> 01:14:11,552
risk for certain poor mental health

1550
01:14:11,606 --> 01:14:12,560
outcomes.

1551
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,400
Okay. Now, Karl well, again, if anyone

1552
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,080
has any comments or questions, please

1553
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:23,010
just raise your physical hand. I can see

1554
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,444
raph ralph raphael sorry. I was just

1555
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:29,670
going to say that I think another

1556
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,604
notable trend is, and I

1557
01:14:33,642 --> 01:14:35,568
just saw somebody say this on YouTube

1558
01:14:35,664 --> 01:14:39,464
just yesterday, that young people are

1559
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:41,384
disproportionately affected by things

1560
01:14:41,422 --> 01:14:43,896
like climate grief because they're the

1561
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:45,544
ones that are going to be alive to deal

1562
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:49,356
with it. And I think

1563
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:51,336
that applies more generally that Peter

1564
01:14:51,368 --> 01:14:52,796
Sanghi already like 30 years or

1565
01:14:52,818 --> 01:14:54,636
something ago, wrote about the

1566
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,956
Inescapable Network of neutrality, the

1567
01:14:56,978 --> 01:15:01,216
reality that what

1568
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:03,888
we do affects each other. Right?

1569
01:15:03,974 --> 01:15:06,864
And we took advantage of this huge

1570
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,656
resource buffer that's called the

1571
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:09,680
biosphere.

1572
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,884
And. Earth to pretend that it didn't for

1573
01:15:17,002 --> 01:15:19,396
quite a long time and got a lot of

1574
01:15:19,418 --> 01:15:22,868
mileage out of it. But now we're at a

1575
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:26,384
point where there's a whole generation

1576
01:15:26,432 --> 01:15:28,136
of people that are coming to grips with

1577
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:30,984
the fact that I'm going to stop myself

1578
01:15:31,022 --> 01:15:32,744
from saying a square word, but oh my

1579
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:36,090
God, we actually need to change

1580
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,550
everything about everything that we do

1581
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,756
and we need to do it fast. By the

1582
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:44,350
way.

1583
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,092
It's not just what we do out there,

1584
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,336
it's also what we do inside, how we get

1585
01:15:52,358 --> 01:15:54,416
ready for how to show up for life

1586
01:15:54,518 --> 01:15:57,312
internally. Right? So no wonder that it

1587
01:15:57,366 --> 01:16:00,636
has that impact. Like myself, I've dealt

1588
01:16:00,668 --> 01:16:04,704
with anxiety and a lot of other

1589
01:16:04,742 --> 01:16:07,180
things. We've had conversations about

1590
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,496
what are we doing bringing a daughter

1591
01:16:08,528 --> 01:16:10,516
into this world and all these kinds of

1592
01:16:10,538 --> 01:16:12,544
things. And I think it's only natural

1593
01:16:12,672 --> 01:16:16,024
that it's coming to a head in this way

1594
01:16:16,062 --> 01:16:19,768
right now. Naom you have your

1595
01:16:19,774 --> 01:16:22,970
hand up and I can't see yes.

1596
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,296
Yeah, it's connect with what has just

1597
01:16:26,318 --> 01:16:29,704
been so and your initial

1598
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,444
question about the gaps that needs to be

1599
01:16:32,482 --> 01:16:35,740
closed, I think like a scale free model

1600
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:38,232
of health and mental health particularly

1601
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:42,172
would be great. We are in silos,

1602
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:45,504
in biomedical research and the fact that

1603
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:49,712
someone is having depression can come

1604
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:52,512
from interacting genes as much as

1605
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:56,556
interacting people and also is

1606
01:16:56,598 --> 01:16:59,236
related to climate change and so on. So

1607
01:16:59,418 --> 01:17:03,712
how we can have a new health systems

1608
01:17:03,776 --> 01:17:06,256
that doesn't deal with those silos and

1609
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:07,816
integrate those different scales, to me

1610
01:17:07,838 --> 01:17:10,724
it's like really a big challenge,

1611
01:17:10,772 --> 01:17:14,356
but a challenge that current models

1612
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:17,032
and work that we can see going that

1613
01:17:17,086 --> 01:17:18,936
direction. And I'm very enthusiastic.

1614
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:19,790
About that?

1615
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,180
Bert.

1616
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:32,094
Yeah. In my

1617
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:33,866
field in engineering, active inference

1618
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:37,454
is not understood because almost all

1619
01:17:37,492 --> 01:17:40,826
papers are written by neuroscientists

1620
01:17:41,018 --> 01:17:43,694
and they're hard to read. So I was

1621
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:46,862
really happy to hear today that.

1622
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:50,114
And I think it's Sanjeev Namjoshi who is

1623
01:17:50,152 --> 01:17:52,286
writing an engineering book on active

1624
01:17:52,318 --> 01:17:54,834
inference. So I think that will really

1625
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:58,358
help. That, together with the

1626
01:17:58,364 --> 01:18:00,406
availability of good toolboxes for

1627
01:18:00,428 --> 01:18:02,454
implementing active inference, should

1628
01:18:02,492 --> 01:18:05,366
make a lot of engineers much more

1629
01:18:05,388 --> 01:18:08,050
enthusiastic about active inference

1630
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:12,140
because it's not something that is

1631
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,594
not understood at the moment in

1632
01:18:15,632 --> 01:18:18,906
engineering circles. So I hope that the

1633
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:21,686
book will be good. I'm enthusiastic

1634
01:18:21,718 --> 01:18:25,710
about that. And Karl,

1635
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:30,990
where are some gaps in your research

1636
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,400
that you'd like to see?

1637
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,294
More than gaps? There's a whole empty

1638
01:18:39,342 --> 01:18:42,690
space out there yet to be explored.

1639
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:46,706
But in

1640
01:18:46,728 --> 01:18:49,720
terms of what seems to be emerging from

1641
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,550
the session and specifically the past

1642
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:55,350
few answers,

1643
01:18:56,730 --> 01:19:00,700
it does seem to be important to

1644
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:04,762
have this very generic just to take

1645
01:19:04,816 --> 01:19:08,522
Bert's sort of line that this is

1646
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,794
just one deflationary simple and

1647
01:19:10,832 --> 01:19:13,214
probably the right way to understand

1648
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:16,320
stuff and to make recommendations or to

1649
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,886
describe people's actions, possibly to

1650
01:19:19,908 --> 01:19:22,990
themselves in a therapeutic context.

1651
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:25,890
And as such, it should be push button

1652
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,542
technology and it should be democratized

1653
01:19:28,606 --> 01:19:32,194
and socialized. And I think that's the

1654
01:19:32,232 --> 01:19:35,362
challenge, practically. And 1 may ask,

1655
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:38,470
why would you want to do that? For me,

1656
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:42,710
there are two clear imperatives.

1657
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:46,482
One is very abstract,

1658
01:19:46,546 --> 01:19:49,926
and it's not really within my comfort

1659
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,574
zone, and the other one is in my comfort

1660
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:53,066
zone. But the one that's outside my

1661
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:57,238
comfort zone is this notion

1662
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:02,330
of interactivity and hyperconnectivity

1663
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:06,240
and the metacrisis that we heard about.

1664
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:10,942
And Aguim also referred to this in terms

1665
01:20:10,996 --> 01:20:13,402
of what he was trying to distinguish

1666
01:20:13,466 --> 01:20:15,794
between a Californian notion of

1667
01:20:15,832 --> 01:20:19,234
optimality and another kind, another way

1668
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:23,074
forward. And to me, it's a

1669
01:20:23,112 --> 01:20:25,938
stark contrast with growth is good

1670
01:20:26,104 --> 01:20:29,506
versus sustainability. And of course,

1671
01:20:29,528 --> 01:20:31,542
the math of the free energy principle is

1672
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:34,006
just about sustainability. It's just a

1673
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:37,586
description of the physics of systems,

1674
01:20:37,698 --> 01:20:39,750
random, dynamical systems that self

1675
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:41,974
organize to some non equilibrium steady

1676
01:20:42,022 --> 01:20:44,300
state. That is what we are.

1677
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:48,294
So for me, there's something deeply,

1678
01:20:48,422 --> 01:20:50,682
if you like, apt about the free energy

1679
01:20:50,736 --> 01:20:52,446
principle and its chronologies, such as

1680
01:20:52,468 --> 01:20:55,118
active inference in application to

1681
01:20:55,204 --> 01:20:57,486
ecosystems and lived ecosystems and

1682
01:20:57,508 --> 01:21:00,894
realized ecosystems. So if

1683
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:03,722
those basic principles can be brought

1684
01:21:03,786 --> 01:21:07,010
back into globalization,

1685
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,900
into the market, into fintech, into

1686
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:14,386
social media, into politics, into

1687
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:16,898
climate action, I think that would be a

1688
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:19,806
good thing. I'm just mindful this struck

1689
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:21,810
me in a number of the presentations

1690
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:24,486
today. You remember before, Bert was

1691
01:21:24,508 --> 01:21:26,246
saying, if you look at the brain, which

1692
01:21:26,268 --> 01:21:28,854
is a really lovely example of a self

1693
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:30,854
organizing system to a non equilibrium

1694
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:34,102
steady state, then it's empty.

1695
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,498
And what did he mean by that? What he

1696
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:37,466
didn't mean you were empty headed. What

1697
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:40,374
he meant was it's incredibly sparsely

1698
01:21:40,422 --> 01:21:43,214
connected. Now, that tells you

1699
01:21:43,252 --> 01:21:45,086
immediately that a pathology of

1700
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,242
connectivity is hyperconnectivity

1701
01:21:47,306 --> 01:21:49,710
overconnectivity, which immediately,

1702
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:54,160
well, it made me very alert to

1703
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:57,278
the presentation of the metacrisis.

1704
01:21:57,374 --> 01:22:00,114
That one of the first three things that

1705
01:22:00,152 --> 01:22:03,746
was underwrote the metacrisis or

1706
01:22:03,848 --> 01:22:07,602
the current crisis we're tending with is

1707
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:10,786
a destruction of that sparse, delicate

1708
01:22:10,818 --> 01:22:13,206
connectivity that defines thingness and

1709
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,234
defines ensembles of things technically

1710
01:22:15,282 --> 01:22:17,286
in terms of Markov blankets. So if we

1711
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:19,394
want a world in which lots of different

1712
01:22:19,452 --> 01:22:21,306
things can coexist in some kind of

1713
01:22:21,328 --> 01:22:23,622
generalized synchrony in a sustainable

1714
01:22:23,686 --> 01:22:26,758
way, you need fast connectivity.

1715
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:28,746
And the pathology, the thing that will

1716
01:22:28,768 --> 01:22:32,286
destroy that, is overconnectivity. So it

1717
01:22:32,308 --> 01:22:33,966
seems to be very important that we get

1718
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:37,710
that into play in terms of

1719
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,474
machine learning, artificial

1720
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:43,258
intelligence, politics, fintech,

1721
01:22:43,354 --> 01:22:45,258
climate change. And the only way it's

1722
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:47,710
going to get there is epistemically by

1723
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:50,626
equipping people to actually build their

1724
01:22:50,648 --> 01:22:52,114
own little models and ask their own

1725
01:22:52,152 --> 01:22:53,714
questions. You can't tell people this

1726
01:22:53,752 --> 01:22:55,106
they've got to learn they've got to

1727
01:22:55,128 --> 01:22:57,574
learn it for themselves. Just very

1728
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,558
quickly, I'm sure we've only got a

1729
01:22:59,564 --> 01:23:00,680
couple of minutes left.

1730
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,022
The other agenda, which I'm more

1731
01:23:06,076 --> 01:23:08,566
familiar with is exactly Anna's and

1732
01:23:08,588 --> 01:23:11,498
Guillaume's agenda, which is making this

1733
01:23:11,584 --> 01:23:15,402
work in the context of

1734
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:18,426
neurology and psychiatry. So if you can

1735
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:22,046
democratize and socialize this way

1736
01:23:22,068 --> 01:23:24,014
of describing things so that people can

1737
01:23:24,052 --> 01:23:26,558
now build models of their particular

1738
01:23:26,644 --> 01:23:28,394
patient in the other use of precision

1739
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:32,106
psychiatry, I suspect that Guillum's

1740
01:23:32,218 --> 01:23:35,330
unit was called after. So it's a

1741
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,458
personalized medicine that is really

1742
01:23:37,544 --> 01:23:39,986
personalized in the sense that you

1743
01:23:40,008 --> 01:23:42,354
actually have your digital twin of your

1744
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,826
behavior. And then you've got that. You

1745
01:23:45,848 --> 01:23:49,254
optimize your digital twin to become a

1746
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:52,294
model of your patient, and then you can

1747
01:23:52,332 --> 01:23:55,238
start to do experiments on that model,

1748
01:23:55,404 --> 01:23:57,862
behavioral interventions, or even share

1749
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,478
that model very much in the spirit of

1750
01:23:59,484 --> 01:24:01,782
CBT with the patient and say, look,

1751
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,146
this is you. This is what would happen

1752
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,698
if you went out and did this. And this

1753
01:24:04,704 --> 01:24:06,026
is what would happen if you went out and

1754
01:24:06,048 --> 01:24:09,866
did that. To my mind.

1755
01:24:09,968 --> 01:24:11,682
And indeed, that was the initial

1756
01:24:11,766 --> 01:24:13,454
motivation for much of this work, was

1757
01:24:13,492 --> 01:24:17,370
actually to build observation models

1758
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:20,622
of psychiatric conditions, to work out

1759
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:24,974
both the pharmacological and

1760
01:24:25,012 --> 01:24:27,102
physiological basis and the disruption

1761
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:30,146
of the pathology of precision and

1762
01:24:30,168 --> 01:24:32,098
message. Passing on the factographs that

1763
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:33,586
are our brain even though they are very

1764
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:36,674
empty on the one hand, but also get that

1765
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:39,106
behavior, that key thing that Anna was

1766
01:24:39,128 --> 01:24:40,914
talking about the active engagement with

1767
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:44,354
the lived world into that model

1768
01:24:44,472 --> 01:24:47,234
and hence active inference. And just to

1769
01:24:47,272 --> 01:24:51,270
conclude that that activity,

1770
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:53,034
that sort of physical engagement, that

1771
01:24:53,072 --> 01:24:55,834
embodiment, that sort of for ease and

1772
01:24:55,872 --> 01:24:58,314
everything else, I think it's really

1773
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:00,700
coming to a head now in terms of people

1774
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,854
after, the large language model, after

1775
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:07,550
the Chat GPT moment, the bounce back

1776
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,262
has been what's missing? What's not

1777
01:25:11,316 --> 01:25:12,862
there? And of course, what is not there

1778
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:15,426
is agency and embodied engagement with

1779
01:25:15,448 --> 01:25:18,994
the world. And that's why I think

1780
01:25:19,192 --> 01:25:22,100
there's still a lot of work to be done

1781
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,994
in bringing artificial intelligence read

1782
01:25:25,032 --> 01:25:28,646
as active inference in a way

1783
01:25:28,668 --> 01:25:32,582
that matters to people who people

1784
01:25:32,636 --> 01:25:34,406
who can make a difference, which is

1785
01:25:34,428 --> 01:25:36,274
basically everybody, but specifically

1786
01:25:36,322 --> 01:25:38,194
politicians and doctors and engineers

1787
01:25:38,242 --> 01:25:41,754
and the like. So you all

1788
01:25:41,792 --> 01:25:44,602
now have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to

1789
01:25:44,656 --> 01:25:47,066
speak directly to the audience. What is

1790
01:25:47,088 --> 01:25:49,926
the message that you what closing

1791
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,354
message do you have? You're speaking

1792
01:25:51,392 --> 01:25:53,210
directly to someone who's listening.

1793
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:55,306
They're a curious person. They're

1794
01:25:55,338 --> 01:25:56,926
interested in active inference. They

1795
01:25:56,948 --> 01:25:58,270
also want to lead better lives,

1796
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:01,694
hopefully, and do something

1797
01:26:01,732 --> 01:26:04,546
propitious. So what message do you have

1798
01:26:04,568 --> 01:26:08,034
for them? Anna, we'll start

1799
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:08,820
with you.

1800
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,864
Gosh. I'm just going to say what pops

1801
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:18,276
into my mind right now is that one

1802
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,888
of the things I have learned from my

1803
01:26:19,914 --> 01:26:21,224
patients who are trying to get into

1804
01:26:21,262 --> 01:26:23,992
recovery from severe addictions is

1805
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:25,780
something that they call the set aside

1806
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,544
prayer where they set aside all of the

1807
01:26:29,582 --> 01:26:31,676
notions that they have about how the

1808
01:26:31,698 --> 01:26:33,996
world works and try to be completely

1809
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:38,140
open and receptive to information

1810
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:41,084
coming into their minds. And I think

1811
01:26:41,122 --> 01:26:45,984
that's just a

1812
01:26:46,022 --> 01:26:49,616
wonderful frame or concept for all of

1813
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:52,844
us living in the world to periodically

1814
01:26:52,892 --> 01:26:55,148
just take a moment and take these models

1815
01:26:55,164 --> 01:26:56,896
and just say everything I think I know

1816
01:26:56,918 --> 01:26:58,320
about the world, I'm going to

1817
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:00,276
temporarily suspend it, and I'm just

1818
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,292
going to be open. And when that happens,

1819
01:27:02,346 --> 01:27:04,996
we can be present and learn in a way

1820
01:27:05,018 --> 01:27:06,596
that it's not possible when we're just

1821
01:27:06,618 --> 01:27:09,988
trying to reinforce our models. Great.

1822
01:27:10,074 --> 01:27:12,296
Fantastic. And Bert. And then we'll go.

1823
01:27:12,318 --> 01:27:15,720
Karl. And then Raph and then Guillaume.

1824
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:20,136
Well, I just enjoyed today very much. I

1825
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:23,848
thought there was a lot of material,

1826
01:27:23,944 --> 01:27:25,804
both for people from, let's say,

1827
01:27:25,842 --> 01:27:28,684
psychology, neuroscience, but also for

1828
01:27:28,722 --> 01:27:31,304
engineers. So if you haven't watched

1829
01:27:31,432 --> 01:27:33,948
some of the talks, go look through the

1830
01:27:33,954 --> 01:27:35,504
schedule, because some of the talks were

1831
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:36,912
really good, I think. So I really

1832
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:39,744
enjoyed that. And then, yeah, what

1833
01:27:39,782 --> 01:27:42,928
should I tell people? Go work out. Do a

1834
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:44,690
lot of sports. It's good for you.

1835
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,808
Yeah. Sorry, I was going to make a joke,

1836
01:27:51,824 --> 01:27:53,910
but I can't because it wouldn't be.

1837
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,728
So I'm going to use my 30 seconds just

1838
01:27:58,814 --> 01:28:02,664
to thank Daniel and his team for

1839
01:28:02,702 --> 01:28:06,090
this. If you want something to do,

1840
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,320
you should go and watch the live streams

1841
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,488
and get involved with this ecosystem.

1842
01:28:14,584 --> 01:28:16,376
I hadn't seen that paper being presented

1843
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:19,180
before, but I was really impressed with

1844
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,736
the Active Institute and its openness

1845
01:28:21,768 --> 01:28:26,044
and its welcoming attitude

1846
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,240
and vision, like the Smithsonian.

1847
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:32,028
So if you want to pursue these ideas,

1848
01:28:32,124 --> 01:28:35,184
get involved. And if you haven't got

1849
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:37,204
time, just make sure you attend next

1850
01:28:37,242 --> 01:28:39,296
year's Active Inference Institute

1851
01:28:39,408 --> 01:28:41,780
celebration. But thank you, Daniel.

1852
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,964
Raphael yeah. So I'll second what

1853
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:50,468
Karl said and follow on with it's.

1854
01:28:50,484 --> 01:28:53,956
An invitation not just to participate

1855
01:28:54,148 --> 01:28:55,944
in the Active Defense Institute, but

1856
01:28:55,982 --> 01:28:58,632
also the invitation to participate in

1857
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:01,888
building this Gaia tractor,

1858
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:05,324
this new way of doing things that

1859
01:29:05,442 --> 01:29:08,860
acknowledges the value of growth, and

1860
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,064
also the value of sustainability, joins

1861
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:12,284
it all together in this thing called

1862
01:29:12,322 --> 01:29:16,956
regeneration. And it

1863
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:18,556
really is a collective effort. It's a

1864
01:29:18,578 --> 01:29:19,900
collective learning effort.

1865
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,756
And this also, by the way, also applies

1866
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:27,188
to the panelists as well. I think.

1867
01:29:27,354 --> 01:29:30,468
Obviously, what Bert and Karl are doing,

1868
01:29:30,554 --> 01:29:33,844
it has immediate things that have to do

1869
01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:37,188
with what we're after. But one of

1870
01:29:37,194 --> 01:29:40,064
the main things that we keep discussing

1871
01:29:40,112 --> 01:29:43,412
is also like this the inter

1872
01:29:43,466 --> 01:29:46,196
subjectivity and the importance of being

1873
01:29:46,218 --> 01:29:48,260
able to operate well as humans together.

1874
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:50,304
And that connects directly to cognitive

1875
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:56,204
science in psychiatry. And so everybody

1876
01:29:56,322 --> 01:30:00,220
that wants to be engaged and

1877
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:02,012
be a part of building a better world

1878
01:30:02,066 --> 01:30:05,330
should be thinking about what am I doing

1879
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:09,996
as an individual or as employee

1880
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:12,064
of organization or as a researcher or as

1881
01:30:12,102 --> 01:30:14,816
a leader or as a family member, what am

1882
01:30:14,838 --> 01:30:19,604
I doing? How does it contribute to this

1883
01:30:19,642 --> 01:30:22,436
new non equilibrium set of state?

1884
01:30:22,538 --> 01:30:24,884
So, yeah, that's kind of it. I probably

1885
01:30:24,922 --> 01:30:26,676
blew through the 60 seconds, but here it

1886
01:30:26,698 --> 01:30:29,320
is. And Guillaume,

1887
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,112
well, I would thanks also, all of you

1888
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:36,184
for the discussion and the organizer for

1889
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,576
what they are doing. Indeed, the work of

1890
01:30:39,598 --> 01:30:41,930
the Active Inference Institute is very

1891
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,524
laudable and interesting from an open

1892
01:30:44,562 --> 01:30:46,204
science perspective. They are really

1893
01:30:46,322 --> 01:30:49,516
embodying. That so big kudos to

1894
01:30:49,538 --> 01:30:53,228
them. And well, the Frieze was saying

1895
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:55,616
to do sport is good for you. I'm not

1896
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:58,544
very good at sports, but some say that

1897
01:30:58,582 --> 01:31:02,016
science is a team sport. So at least

1898
01:31:02,198 --> 01:31:05,772
have a good team perspective when doing

1899
01:31:05,846 --> 01:31:07,604
science. And being kind to each other

1900
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:10,470
would be the best advice to everyone.

1901
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,230
Well, thank you.

1902
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,828
You get yours too. Somebody else has to

1903
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:19,636
come in from outside the Markov blanket,

1904
01:31:19,668 --> 01:31:23,176
though. Well, I wanted to just thank

1905
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,072
you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. And

1906
01:31:26,126 --> 01:31:29,556
Raphael and also Karl and Anna and Bert

1907
01:31:29,588 --> 01:31:32,076
and Yom. This was tremendous amount of

1908
01:31:32,098 --> 01:31:35,596
fun. And well, I hope I get to speak to

1909
01:31:35,618 --> 01:31:38,716
you all individually. And as usual, I

1910
01:31:38,738 --> 01:31:41,004
have way more questions than we were

1911
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:44,044
able to get to. Thank you all.

1912
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:47,790
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks everyone.

1913
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,812
Farewell to the panelists. You're all.

1914
01:31:50,866 --> 01:31:54,300
Welcome back anytime. Thanks everybody,

1915
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:57,236
for watching. Be watching. Right now

1916
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,200
we're about to head over to the discord

1917
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,556
and hang out and talk a little more if

1918
01:32:01,578 --> 01:32:04,448
you want to, and then stay involved,

1919
01:32:04,624 --> 01:32:07,748
get involved. So till next time.
