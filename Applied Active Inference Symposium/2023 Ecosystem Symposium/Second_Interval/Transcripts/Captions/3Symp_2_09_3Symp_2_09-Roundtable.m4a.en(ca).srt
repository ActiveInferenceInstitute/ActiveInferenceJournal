1
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,965
Daniel: All right, the next session is

2
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:19,003
going

3
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:24,561
to be the final session of this symposium.

4
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:24,561
.

5
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,879
It's been a really incredible journey,

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,154
and I think this final session is going

7
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:32,309
to be great as well.

8
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:37,818
So we have a whole panel here, and people

9
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:41,256
can use their cameras (even though I'm

10
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:46,728
not), if they want to, Welcome, everyone!

11
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:51,200
I'll just introduce the facilitator, Curt

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,362
Jaimungal.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,670
So Curt is a legend in the ActInf

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,015
ecosystem and has done incredible work

15
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,794
with a variety of researchers and curious

16
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:06,130
individuals in the space, so we could

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,449
think of no one better to host this

18
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:13,849
conversation and bring it all together.

19
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,161
So, Curt, I'll pass it to you.

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,445
You'll keep an eye on the live chat.

21
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:22,720
Anyone can call it if they need any

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:22,797
supports.

23
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:26,188
Otherwise, thanks, everybody, for joining.

24
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:26,188
.

25
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:30,559
And we don't see you yet, Curt.

26
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:32,733
Curt: But yeah, it would it be all right

27
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:33,886
if I left and then came right back?

28
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:35,013
For whatever reason, my camera is not

29
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:35,044
working.

30
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,103
Daniel: Sounds good.

31
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,174
Sounds good.

32
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:39,407
Curt: Okay, I'll be right back in about

33
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:39,476
25 seconds.

34
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:44,994
Daniel: Well, welcome, everyone.

35
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,063
We will get started in just a second.

36
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:06,159
Curt: It's so odd.

37
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,176
I apologize for that.

38
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:11,205
Okay, well, you can hear my voice, at

39
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:12,210
least.

40
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:16,250
Yes, just give me a moment.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,287
Boy.

42
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:26,358
Okay, well, we'll do what we can.

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,415
Okay, so you all can't see me, but that's

44
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:34,430
all right.

45
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:36,455
So we have this all-star panel here today,

46
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,476
, which to me means my invitation must

47
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,497
have been a mistake, but I'll take it.

48
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:42,513
Thank you to the Active Inference

49
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:42,519
Institutes!

50
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,537
And I'll go around this virtual zoom

51
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,556

85
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,326
My name is Curt Jaimungal, and I use my

86
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,346
background in mathematical physics to

87
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,367
analyze various Theories of Everything

88
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,378
that are proposed.

89
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:22,397
These include both the theoretical

90
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:24,417
physics side of Grand Unification with

91
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,439
gravity, and dualities, other schemes; as

92
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,459
well as attempting to understand what

93
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,475
constitutes consciousness.

94
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,493
You can find the podcast by typing in

95
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,512
“Theories of Everything” onto YouTube or

96
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:36,529
whatever podcast catcher you have.

97
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,551
So my question to everyone,

98
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:40,575
the initial question, is: What have you

99
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,598
been working on in the past few months,

100
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,616
and what excites you about it?

101
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,655
We'll start with Bert.

102
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:51,688
You seem to be smiling; and your name

103
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:53,704
sounds like mine.

104
00:04:53,704 --> 00:05:37,081
Bert: [Bert is accidentally muted.]

105
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,089
Okay.

106
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:41,127
All right, so my name is Bert de Vries.

107
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,136
And, yeah,

108
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,173
I lead a lab in an electrical engineering

109
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,184
department.

110
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:50,216
And so our lab is called BIASlab, as you

111
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,224
mentioned.

112
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,245
So we are interested in Bayesian

113
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:55,264
inference in general, but more

114
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,286
specifically in doing it as fast as

115
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:58,294
possible.

116
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,264
That has lots of applications outside

117
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:03,285
active inference, also for signal

118
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,312
processing and other control systems, but

119
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,336
definitely, of course, also for active

120
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:09,345
inference.

121
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:12,376
So half our work over the past few months,

122
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,403
, but even over the past few years, has

123
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,430
been on developing a toolbox to support

124
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,458
or to get as far as we can go with trying

125
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,483
to do real time Bayesian inference or

126
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,509
real time free energy minimization and

127
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,530
trying it in applications.

128
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,578
So that's the work – that I try to lead a

129
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:36,618
team of PhD students who do the real work,

130
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:36,619
,

131
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,643
of course. I walk around with a cup of

132
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,666
coffee, but that's what they've been

133
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,674
working on.

134
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:44,694
Curt: Great!

135
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,714
And Professor Lembke, please.

136
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,773
Anna: Yeah, well, what I've been working

137
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:55,804
on in the last, I don't know, year or so,

138
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:58,835
is spending a lot of time thinking about

139
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,804
how it is that a faith framework - in

140
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,836
particular, surrender to a higher power -

141
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,859
improves people's lives.

142
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,892
And I've been really struggling to come

143
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,920
up with a way of talking about this that

144
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,930
is inclusive.

145
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:16,958
Thinking about it, talking about it.  It

146
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,987
gets to a kind of core piece of it that I'

147
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:22,013
'm interested in, which is not so much

148
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,039
whether or not God exists and what the

149
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,066
proof is or not of whether God exists.

150
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,094
But really, what is it that changes in

151
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,115
people's lives when they undergo a

152
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:34,137
spiritual transformation, when they

153
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,157
surrender to a higher power?

154
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,197
Why do their lives get better, when they

155
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:41,208
DO get better?

156
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,239
And I'm really new to the active

157
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,253
inference world.

158
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,277
Daniel Friedman is the one who's

159
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,298
introduced me to these ideas.

160
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,326
I'm really excited about the ways in

161
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:56,355
which the whole active inference model

162
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:59,386
might help me (at least) think about what'

163
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,341
's going on there.

164
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,373
And that's what I'm working on.

165
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:06,396
It's a little weird, but that's what I'm

166
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:07,404
interested in.

167
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:09,422
Curt: Great.

168
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:15,482
Professor Friston. (You're muted.)

169
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,513
Karl: Yes, that's going to be the title

170
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:19,521
of my next book:

171
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:23,568
“Karl, You're on Mute!” Retro from the...

172
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:26,592
possibly the future.

173
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,634
I generally work on what I'm told to work

174
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:33,660
on, so I'm just trying to list what I've

175
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,686
been working on in the past few months.

176
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:36,698
Interestingly,

177
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,730
it actually starts with Daniel Friedman

178
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,759
and his fascination, along with Axel

179
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,790
Constant, for evolutionary explanations

180
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,819
that speak to many of the scale free

181
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,850
issues that we've been hearing about in

182
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,868
the prior session.

183
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:56,895
So that's what I was working on, really,

184
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:59,925
a scale free approach to understanding

185
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:02,892
temporally nested processes as free

186
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,922
energy minimizing processes as a kind of

187
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,953
active inference, and how that would lead

188
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:11,986
to a variational synthesis of evolution.

189
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,019
And then I was told to work on belief

190
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,049
sharing by Mahault and colleagues at

191
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:21,084
VERSES, and worked on that in the context

192
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,113
of synthetic language and tried to

193
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:27,141
establish a really simple proof of

194
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:30,171
principle that communication was an

195
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:33,204
emergent property of any free ensemble,

196
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:36,235
free energy minimizing system.

197
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:40,273
And just to open brackets, just to make

198
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,299
the observation, it struck me time and

199
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,325
time again during the session today how

200
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,353
important communication is, whether we're

201
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:51,380
talking about Bert's passing messages or

202
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,409
responding to "you've got a new posterior,

203
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,434
," or we're talking about the kind of

204
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,460
communication that Mahault was talking

205
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,468
about.

206
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,427
Well, everybody's been talking about.

207
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,459
It does seem to be really, indeed, the

208
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,491
Gaia notion of overconnectivity and too

209
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,523
much communication or the wrong kind of

210
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,537
communication.

211
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:18,590
It does strike me that's quite central to

212
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,628
both the theme of the workshop and the

213
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:26,671
specific presentations that we've heard.

214
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:29,707
And then in the past few weeks, working

215
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:33,740
on stuff I think that Bert would be more

216
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,773
interested in, which is fast and frugal

217
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:39,805
message passing schemes that enable the

218
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,837
evaluation of the expected free energy,

219
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,865
not to suffer from the limitations

220
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,895
imposed by deep tree searches.

221
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:52,929
So possibly Ashwin has spoken about this

222
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,962
earlier on, but you're using ideas from

223
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:58,997
dynamic programming, backwards induction,

224
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,968
to try and take the pressure off the

225
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:05,002
message passing to get fast and efficient

226
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:08,035
evaluations of the expected free energy

227
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,065
in sort of single unit, single agent

228
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:13,085
active inference.

229
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,104
What have I been doing this week?

230
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:17,127
Can't remember.

231
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:19,149
That's what I've been doing.

232
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:21,163
Curt: Great.

233
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,184
Rafael Kaufmann, please.

234
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,250
Just a moment.

235
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:34,297
Can everyone else hear?

236
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:36,313
Okay.

237
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:40,359
Rafael: What about now?

238
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,375
Curt: Yeah, great.

239
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:43,385
Rafael: Yeah, thanks.

240
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,407
It's contagious, I think.

241
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,434
So I've also been drinking a lot of

242
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,457
coffee as I've been caring for my now

243
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:52,474
nine month old daughter.

244
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,501
Curt: Congratulations.

245
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:55,509
Rafael: Thank you.

246
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,547
So aside from sleep deprivation, what I'

247
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:03,526
've been doing is (I told you guys about

248
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:07,565
this in the session earlier today) but in

249
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:11,604
a nutshell, we've been working on what we

250
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:14,637
call the Gaia Protocol, or the Gaia

251
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:18,675
network, which is this open approach for

252
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:21,703
building a common engine.

253
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:25,741
You can think of it as a common runtime

254
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:28,778
and a common language with the building

255
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:32,815
blocks of shared decision making in the

256
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:35,847
context of the Med [?] crisis, and

257
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:39,884
getting to a set of building blocks for

258
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,925
decision making that don't kill us all.

259
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:45,942
Bert: So that's kind of it.

260
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,978
Curt: Rafael, how much coffee is a lot of

261
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:49,984
coffee?

262
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,020
Rafael: Well, it's espresso, so I don't

263
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,045
think it's quite comparable to American

264
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,050
coffee.

265
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,068
Curt: All right.

266
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:00,039
And Guillaume Dumas, please.

267
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,053
Guillaume: Yes, sure.

268
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,066
Can you hear me?

269
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,078
Curt: Yes.

270
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,090
Guillaume: Okay.

271
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,118
So in the context of active inference, I

272
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:11,146
have mostly focused on, well, the two big

273
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,159
topics of my lab.

274
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,183
So precision psychiatry and social

275
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,192
physiology.

276
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:16,195
So.

277
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,224
On the precision psychiatry side, Nynke

278
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,247
Boiten presented earlier in this

279
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:24,274
symposium our work on trying to model

280
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:27,303
theory of mind to being able to evaluate,

281
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:30,332
through digital phenotyping, the level of

282
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:33,362
sophistication of interaction in patients

283
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:36,390
with neurodevelopmental disorders.

284
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:39,426
And that connects with also our interest

285
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:42,459
in the social mind and how we can connect

286
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:45,489
our understanding of how we deal with

287
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:49,521
other people but with also ourselves.

288
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:52,554
And so that connects with other work at

289
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:55,585
the Mila, with deep learning architecture,

290
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,614
, with higher order function in humans,

291
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:01,583
where we're trying to combine different

292
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,614
theories of consciousness, such as global

293
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:07,641
neural workspace and attention schema

294
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:07,649
theory.

295
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,674
And in the context of attention schema

296
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,698
theory, there is this kind of recycling

297
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,718
of self and other mechanisms.

298
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:19,763
So that's one big work.

299
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,788
And on the other side, I'm very

300
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:24,817
interested also in multi agent systems.

301
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:27,849
And so with Natalie Castell, who's going

302
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:30,878
to join us soon, we've been working on

303
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,909
creativity and the emergence of cultural

304
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,937
norms in multi agent systems with the

305
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:40,971
idea of applying that to climate action.

306
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,998
And also a new project that is starting

307
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,020
here with NFRF [[New Frontiers in

308
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,047
Research Fund]] of a big Canadian project

309
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:50,072
on Indigenous knowledge and how we can

310
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:52,098
think about new narrative around AI and

311
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,119
typically a less solipsistic and

312
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:57,148
individualistic way of dealing with AI.

313
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,125
So that's the two main fields of research.

314
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:01,125
.

315
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,167
Curt: Can you explain what you mean by

316
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:09,200
less solidistic, less solipsistic when it

317
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,212
comes to AI.

318
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:15,260
Guillaume: The Californian view of AI,

319
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,293
because the narrative is mainly driven by

320
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,326
U.S. and California right now, tends to

321
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:25,359
circle around optimization, profits...

322
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,400
I mean, even OpenAI states that AGI is

323
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,443
about optimizing profitable human tasks.

324
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:35,466
They put like profitable in their

325
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,474
definition.

326
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:40,511
In the case of Indigenous systems of

327
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,539
knowledge, we are more talking about

328
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,559
community sustainability;

329
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,592
and the view already only in the

330
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:51,622
application is less individualistic.

331
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,653
But also in the cognitive science point

332
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,674
of view, we have the outcore

333
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:59,705
computationalism that could say the brain

334
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:02,670
is just like a computer in a very

335
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,687
restrictive sense.

336
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:06,718
And so AI, like, typically those

337
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:10,751
transformers that are massively used

338
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,787
right now, are kind of like "brain in a

339
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:17,822
vat" in a very silicon sense, while we

340
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:21,860
are embodied systems that are constituted

341
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,893
by our interaction with others.

342
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:27,921
And so, in a way, how we can think about

343
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,948
artificial intelligence in this kind of

344
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,973
more co-constitutive way and through a

345
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:34,997
developmental and cultural lens.

346
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,037
Curt: Mm-hmm! Okay, now, speaking of the

347
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:40,057
brain as a computer, we frequently hear

348
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:42,073
in these circles "the brain as a

349
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:43,085
predictive machine."

350
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,112
So where does this, the (quote unquote) "

351
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:48,134
"brain as a predictive machine," have its

352
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:48,137
limits?

353
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,167
And also, is that to be interpreted as

354
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,191
implying conscious experience is a

355
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,211
predictive machine as well?

356
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:57,226
And if not, why not?

357
00:16:57,227 --> 00:17:00,192
So I think, Karl, you'd be a great person

358
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,214
to start this off, and then we'll go

359
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,229
around the table again.

360
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,266
Karl: Yeah, I was mindful of Mahault's

361
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:10,291
presentation the past half hour and the

362
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,312
notion of temporal thickness.

363
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,352
I'm sure that's got a lot to do with the

364
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,376
necessary conditions for the kind of

365
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:19,387
consciousness

366
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,412
(I'm guessing) you're referring to - that

367
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:23,427
freedom from the moment.

368
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:28,471
And if one reads prediction in its sort

369
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:31,506
of psychological or protension nature in

370
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:35,540
terms of being able to predict what will

371
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,561
happen in the future,

372
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:41,607
I think that's going to be sort of a key

373
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:46,650
bright line between things that do not

374
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,691
possess certain kind of sentience and

375
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,711
things that do.

376
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,744
And that bright line just rests basically

377
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:58,772
upon - well, from perspective of active

378
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,739
inference - having a generative model

379
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:03,765
that includes the consequences of your

380
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,787
own actions in the future.

381
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:09,823
So just by having consequences you're now

382
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,851
talking about the future. And the

383
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,882
consequences in the future now become

384
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:16,899
random variables.

385
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,920
Therefore you have to infer them.

386
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,943
Which leads you directly to the notion of

387
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,963
planning as inference, which means that

388
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,984
bright line is just a difference between

389
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,000
things that plan and do not plan.

390
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,004
And I would guess that that's where you

391
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:34,007
probably want to start in terms of

392
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,010
foregrounding the role of prediction as

393
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,013
being an aspect of self organization and

394
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,016
its sort of reading under active

395
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:46,019
inference that characterizes conscious

396
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,022
things from non conscious things, namely

397
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:52,025
the ability to plan.

398
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,026
Does that make sense?

399
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,030
Curt: I have follow up questions;

400
00:18:58,031 --> 00:19:00,027
we'll get to them at some point. But for

401
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:03,030
now, Anna, do you have any comments on

402
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,032
that, and Bert as well afterward?

403
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:10,037
Anna: Well, I'm new to this field so I'm

404
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:13,040
just familiarizing myself even with the

405
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040
language.

406
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,044
But I can respond to the question.

407
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,046
The brain is a predictive machine in

408
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:22,049
terms of the work that I do clinically

409
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,051
and the kind of psychopathology that I

410
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:27,054
see when I'm working with patients, I

411
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,056
work primarily with narrative, the

412
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:32,059
stories that they tell about their lives.

413
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:32,059
.

414
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,062
And one of the recurring themes I've seen

415
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:38,065
through my work is that when patients

416
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,067
tell stories in which they are

417
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,070
perpetually the victims of other people's

418
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,073
actions or the world, that tends to be a

419
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:49,076
predictive model for them so that they

420
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,078
will then go out into the world and

421
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:54,081
unconsciously create scenarios which will

422
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:57,084
perpetuate their victimhood.

423
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:00,081
And that part of getting into wellness is

424
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:03,084
to stop seeing themselves as entirely the

425
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:06,087
victim of other people or circumstance,

426
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,090
instead begin to appreciate what they

427
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,092
contribute to their life problems.

428
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,095
So I guess when I think of the limits of

429
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,098
the brain as a predictive machine, I

430
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,101
think in some ways one of the big limits

431
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,103
is that it's a very powerful predictive

432
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:25,106
machine that actually allows us to

433
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,108
subsequently shape what actually happens

434
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,111
to us and or our perceptions of what

435
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:33,114
happens to us, which then can perpetuate

436
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,116
a false narrative.

437
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,118
And I'll just give one small example from

438
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,119
my own life.

439
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,122
I've had my conflicts with my mother and

440
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,124
one of my beefs about her is that she's a

441
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:46,127
very poor communicator and that whenever

442
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,129
I email her I either get a cryptic

443
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,131
response or no response at all and it

444
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,133
drives me crazy.

445
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,135
And about five years ago she sent an

446
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:57,138
email, asked me some questions, I wrote

447
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:59,140
her back and responded and it was clear

448
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,137
to me that that required yet a response

449
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,139
from her which I never got.

450
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,141
And that then perpetuated my narrative

451
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:09,144
about her as a very poor communicator and

452
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,146
many other negative things.

453
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,149
And then about three months after I sent

454
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,152
that email, I found the email in my draft

455
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,153
box.

456
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,155
So I had never actually responded to my

457
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,156
mother's email.

458
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,157
I hadn't actually sent the email.

459
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:27,162
And that was, for me, just a personal,

460
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:31,166
wonderful example of the ways in which

461
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,170
our actions can actually be manipulated

462
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,174
to support our models and perpetuate

463
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:43,178
falsehoods about the world that we live

464
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,179
in.

465
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,181
Curt: Right.

466
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,183
And I have a quick question, Bert, just

467
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,185
for Anna before we get to you.

468
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,187
So you use the word narrative there.

469
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,188
How are you defining the word narrative?

470
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,190
Is it the same as model?

471
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,191
Is it a sequence of events?

472
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,193
Like, what is the specific definition of

473
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,194
narrative?

474
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,190
Anna: I never really thought about it in

475
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,191
those terms.

476
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:04,193
But when I talk about narrative, I'm

477
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:07,196
talking about the stories that people

478
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:10,199
tell about their lives, because that's

479
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,202
sort of my data and also about models,

480
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:15,204
because what I've discovered about self

481
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:18,207
narrative is it's not just a way to

482
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,209
organize the past.

483
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,211
It also becomes a roadmap for the future.

484
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:22,211
.

485
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,214
That's the language that I use, but I see

486
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:28,217
it maps very nicely onto Ural's language

487
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,219
of modeling the world.

488
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,220
Curt: I see.

489
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,222
Professor DeVries, please.

490
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:37,226
Bert: Yeah, it's clear that the ability

491
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:41,230
to predict is the essence of intelligent

492
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,231
decision making.

493
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,234
Yeah, I have a different background.

494
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
Right.

495
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,236
I'm not a psychiatrist, so I think about

496
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:48,237
these things in different way.

497
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:51,240
The thing that I think about when I think

498
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,243
about prediction is I would assume that

499
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:57,246
brain predicts far ahead, that things get

500
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,247
less accurate.

501
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:58,247
Right.

502
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,244
If I predict that I want to go three

503
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,246
quarters around a roundabout.

504
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,248
I don't care about the centimeter where

505
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:08,251
my car goes when I'm around there, I just

506
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,253
want to get in the right lane.

507
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,256
And I would assume that the brain doesn't

508
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:16,259
takes less computations if you care about

509
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,261
things less precisely.

510
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,264
But that's very hard in a computer.

511
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:26,269
This is what kind of kills us, I think,

512
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,273
in our current way of implementing active

513
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:31,274
inference.

514
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,276
When we want to predict a deep hat, we

515
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:36,279
don't care about the accuracy, but we don'

516
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,282
't know how to do it much cheaper when

517
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,283
things are less accurate.

518
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:45,287
And so that's a problem that we need to

519
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:46,289
be working on.

520
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:52,295
It might be a key to building or to

521
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:55,298
scaling up active entrance agents if we

522
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,300
can actually compute messages that we

523
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,297
want to know that we don't care about, if

524
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:03,300
they are less precise, that we also spend

525
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,303
much less computation on them.

526
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:09,306
Curt: Thank you.

527
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,307
Now, Professor Kaufman.

528
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,312
Rafael: I am not a professor, but I'll

529
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:16,313
answer anyway.

530
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:18,315
Can just call me Rafa.

531
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,316
Karl: Rafa.

532
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:20,317
Rafael: Yeah.

533
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:23,319
So there's so many really interesting

534
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,322
avenues here, and it's not often that I

535
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:28,325
get the pleasure of discussing this kind

536
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:31,328
of stuff with this kind of diverse crowd.

537
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,329
.

538
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:35,332
But I've been interested in these

539
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:39,336
questions for a pretty long time.

540
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:43,340
And I think what comes to mind is how

541
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,344
active inference at the lens, for

542
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:51,348
instance, it enables us to get another

543
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:55,352
sense of what nondualist views on

544
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:59,356
consciousness are saying when they get us

545
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:04,355
experientially to notice the difference.

546
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:07,358
Between what we actually perceive and

547
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,360
between the different various different

548
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,363
processes or things that are going on in

549
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:15,366
our head and our tendency to lump them

550
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,368
all together into the same okay.

551
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,372
This is my experience that I'm immersed

552
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:21,372
in.

553
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:26,377
So noticing being able to notice the

554
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:29,379
difference between the process of

555
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:32,383
perceiving and acting and to an extent,

556
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:35,386
it's automated, and the narrative or the

557
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,389
various narratives that are going on in

558
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:42,392
parallel in my head, whether I'm aware of

559
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:43,394
them or not.

560
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:47,398
And our ability to just put kind of

561
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,401
seemingly arbitrary manner levels on top

562
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,404
of it, to try to make sense of it all and

563
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
to force that experience of having

564
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:58,409
multiple narratives and multiple framings

565
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:01,406
going on at the same time make sense of

566
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:02,407
that experience.

567
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,411
Curt: In a.

568
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
Rafael: Way that aligns with our

569
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,415
presuppositions about how things are.

570
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:13,418
So I think that's super interesting.

571
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:16,421
I also want to highlight that this view

572
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:19,424
of consciousness as being kind of defined

573
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:22,427
by having a narrative or an internal

574
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,430
model that's about self or that at least

575
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,431
is about self.

576
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:30,435
And that leads, as Karl said, to planning

577
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:33,438
this inference that's actually, like,

578
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:36,441
super deflationary in a way that people

579
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,444
are not used to thinking about exciting.

580
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,447
It's opening the doors to all sorts of

581
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,449
exciting interdisciplinary conversations

582
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,451
to be had on the basis of at least, I

583
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:49,454
feel like, better, less talking past each

584
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:50,455
other than we've ever had.

585
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,457
So I'm excited about that.

586
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,460
Curt: And how is it that you're using the

587
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,462
word deflationary there, Karl?

588
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,463
I remember I asked you about that when we

589
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:00,459
had our podcast together.

590
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,461
But Rafael, similar question.

591
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,462
So you said deflationary view.

592
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:06,465
When we have narratives of self, do you

593
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:09,468
mean us to something that consciousness

594
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:10,469
is much more than sorry.

595
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,471
Rafael: Much, yeah.

596
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:16,475
It's not necessarily much less than in

597
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:19,478
the subjective sense, but it's perhaps

598
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:23,482
much less than in the scientific sense.

599
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:27,486
So one example of not saying exactly that,

600
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:30,489
, but maybe something close to what

601
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:34,493
Daniel Dennett calls hetero phenomenology,

602
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:38,497
, which is basically the statement that

603
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,499
the sum of what one can say

604
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:44,503
scientifically about consciousness is is

605
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:45,504
equal to what?

606
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:48,507
Can be studied and modeled and theorized

607
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,509
and communicated and learned and agreed

608
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:53,512
upon on the basis of objective data about

609
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,514
what people, including you, but also

610
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:58,516
other people say about their experience

611
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:00,513
and, of course, what can be measured.

612
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
Up neuro, correlates and whatever.

613
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,517
Which is not the same as not necessarily

614
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,520
the same as our experience of what we

615
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,523
think is our direct experience of being

616
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,524
conscious.

617
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
Curt: Right.

618
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,527
Rafael: So one way to look at it is that

619
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,530
the science of consciousness doesn't

620
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,534
necessarily have to put the primacy on

621
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,535
people.

622
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,537
For instance, people saying they have

623
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,540
qualia, that we thought in that sense it'

624
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,541
's deflationary.

625
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,542
Right.

626
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,546
You have to explain why people believe

627
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,548
they have qualia, not why people have

628
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,550
qualia because it's not necessarily a

629
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,552
scientific truth that people have.

630
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,556
Curt: Right, Professor Dumas.

631
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,558
Guillaume: Yes.

632
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,560
Well, on the limits of brain as

633
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,563
predictive machine, well, we should be

634
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,566
always careful to not move from one map

635
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
territory fallacy to another one for sure.

636
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
.

637
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,567
So we need to be skeptics and avoid to

638
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,569
refine the methods.

639
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,573
And well, this World symposium show how

640
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:10,577
this metaphor is super useful and

641
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:13,580
fruitful, but I can see like two main

642
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,584
limits or at least things where we should

643
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,586
be careful.

644
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:23,590
So following what Professor Lembke said

645
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,594
in psychiatry, I think the looping

646
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:30,597
effects and the way people picture

647
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:35,602
themselves can be very unpredictable.

648
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,605
And so the way we think about the brain

649
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:42,609
as a predictive machine think prediction

650
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,611
for patients would have different

651
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:47,614
signification of what we mean by

652
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,617
predictive machines in the context of

653
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:53,620
active inference and in general.

654
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,623
Also, I can see that certain

655
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:59,626
psychologists or anthropologists would

656
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:02,623
have a big appeal all of a sudden for

657
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:05,626
active inference and free energy

658
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,629
principles, but taking the words as

659
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:12,633
directly what they think the word mean,

660
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:15,636
where we need to be careful in the way to

661
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:17,638
communicate it.

662
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:20,641
And typically following also what

663
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,644
Professor Debris said about prediction as

664
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:27,648
being super important for decision making,

665
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:30,651
, I think we should be careful about the

666
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:34,655
weirdness of cognitive science and how it

667
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,658
doesn't necessarily expand to non Western

668
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:41,662
educated industrialized country, where

669
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,665
maybe the cultural value is not about

670
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,668
optimization of your decision making or

671
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:49,670
your profit.

672
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,672
And so that's the first thing where I

673
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:52,673
think we should be careful.

674
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,676
It's more like a matter of how to

675
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:59,680
communicate the theory in that case, not

676
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,678
necessarily a limit of the theory itself,

677
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:06,681
but the second one is about the

678
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,684
equivalents or not with other.

679
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:15,690
Like, I can see we had Mahault Albarracin

680
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,694
talking about category theory.

681
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,697
And I'm very curious about right now

682
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,700
among the different frameworks that are

683
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,703
out there, how can we define what is

684
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:31,706
equivalent or not with active inference

685
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,709
to be able to see those limits?

686
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,712
Maybe we are leaving what happened with

687
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,714
quantum mechanics in the early 20th

688
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,717
century with different interpretation,

689
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:44,719
with different tools to model quantum

690
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,721
mechanics, and here with artificial

691
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,724
intelligence and cognitive neuroscience,

692
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,726
we have also all those frameworks.

693
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:54,729
And I think the limitation would be then

694
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,732
to not take this interpretation as the

695
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:00,729
only one, but try to have a cross talk

696
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:03,732
and a differential diagnosis of which one

697
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:06,735
is the best for explaining what.

698
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:11,740
Curt: Okay, now my role is the moderator,

699
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,742
but I would like you all to speak to one

700
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:14,743
another.

701
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,745
So I'm going to ask a question that will

702
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:17,746
serve as well.

703
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:18,747
You each will speak on it, but as the

704
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:20,749
other person is speaking sorry, as the

705
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,751
other people are speaking, just think,

706
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,753
okay, is there a question that I have or

707
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:26,755
is there a comment that I have?

708
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:29,758
So the question is what are some of the

709
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:32,761
recent advancements or breakthroughs in

710
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,763
your respective fields that you find

711
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:37,766
particularly promising and well recent,

712
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:40,769
let's say 2020 till now so we'll start

713
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,772
off with Rafael you're smiling and you

714
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:44,773
look like.

715
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,775
Rafael: You'Re champion I was thinking

716
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,776
what is my field?

717
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:48,777
Bert: Right?

718
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:48,777
Karl: Because.

719
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:54,783
Rafael: We'Re very much in the last mile

720
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:58,787
of applying the wonderful stuff that y'

721
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:02,785
'all come up with and making it useful on

722
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:06,789
the so I'm extraordinarily excited about

723
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:09,792
research like what Bird is doing.

724
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:15,798
And I feel like, as Gion was saying, we'

725
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:22,805
're also starting to see some convergence

726
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:25,808
on different ways to get.

727
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,811
Curt: At.

728
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,814
Rafael: Least the same shape of answers

729
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:34,817
and in some cases, even to the same

730
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:35,818
result.

731
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:40,823
So one example of this is work that Chris

732
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:44,827
Fields, Karl and others have been doing

733
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:48,831
on the quantum basically explaining

734
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:52,835
quantum information theory and how it

735
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:56,839
relates to the free energy principle.

736
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,842
Looking at the free energy principle as

737
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,839
the classical limit of quantum

738
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,842
information theory and I don't pretend to

739
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,845
understand all of it, but as somebody who

740
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,847
is coming from a quantum physics

741
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,850
background just being alive to see this

742
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,853
kind of conversions happening which as I

743
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:19,856
mean, as Guillaume said, we've been at

744
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:21,858
this business of post classical what the

745
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:24,861
hell is going on for over a century now

746
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,864
and it's nice to be at a time where again

747
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,867
we're starting to talk less past each

748
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:33,870
other and that's from a theoretical

749
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,873
perspective, from a practical perspective,

750
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,876
, I think just finding that we have all

751
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:41,878
the building blocks to create fast,

752
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:44,881
interpretable, reliable and aligned

753
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:47,884
decision making systems which includes AI

754
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:50,887
systems, autonomous systems that have all

755
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,890
those characteristics and that it turns

756
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,892
out that all the things that the

757
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:58,894
reinforcement learning and deep net

758
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,891
neural networks people talk were very

759
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,894
hard or impossible are sort of in the

760
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,897
realm of what we can do looking at things

761
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,900
from an active inference lens and vice

762
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,902
versa.

763
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,905
A lot of things that active inference

764
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:18,908
models have incorporated so far, it turns

765
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,911
out if you toss in a neural network

766
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,915
approximator here and borrow some other

767
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,918
massively parallel computation techniques,

768
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,921
, it also becomes feasible.

769
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,923
So it's converging.

770
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:34,925
Karl: Yeah.

771
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,928
Curt: For me, what's remarkable is that

772
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,930
there's so many domains of what we

773
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,934
thought was exclusively human or would be

774
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,937
exclusively human for decades that in

775
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,939
just the past couple years robots or

776
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:52,943
computers seem to be just as good, if not

777
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:53,944
exceeding us.

778
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,947
And I don't know if that's promising or

779
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,949
worrisome, but anyhow Karl, please, if

780
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,945
you don't mind answering the question.

781
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:01,946
And then we'll go.

782
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:03,948
Anna then Bert and then Dumas.

783
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,953
Karl: Actually, just reflecting upon one

784
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,956
of your observations I think it's very

785
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:14,959
difficult to identify one thing.

786
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,964
In a sense, what is impressive is the

787
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:23,968
diversity of advances and applications.

788
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,971
And I just say that because that's what I

789
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:29,974
was thinking over the past 6 hours, just

790
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,977
listening to your amazing presentation

791
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:34,979
after presentation and just noting how

792
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:37,982
diverse and yet there's this common

793
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,985
thread, this common commitment, basically

794
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:43,988
stating our curiosity and using the tools

795
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:45,990
that naturalize, that kind of sense

796
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,992
making, curious behavior and

797
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,995
communication that inherit from sort of

798
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:53,998
either maths or category theory or as

799
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:55,000
Ralph notes now, quantum information

800
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,002
theory.

801
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:58,003
But just to pick up on a couple of things

802
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:00,999
which are relevant to this conversation.

803
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,002
So the work with Chris Fields, it sounds

804
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:06,005
lovely and exciting to bring quantum

805
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,008
mechanics into active inference, but that'

806
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:12,011
's not the move that I think Chris is

807
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:14,013
really wanting to champion.

808
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,017
The move, I think, is something that we'

809
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,019
've all been addressing in one way or

810
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:23,022
another, which is leveraging the scale

811
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:26,025
free aspects of this principled approach

812
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:29,028
to self organization and hopefully self

813
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:32,031
organization to some kind of generalized

814
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:33,032
synchrony.

815
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,035
So that's where the quantum information

816
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:38,037
theory gets into the game.

817
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:39,038
It is scale free.

818
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:41,040
And indeed, he will go further and say it'

819
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,042
's completely background free and

820
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,043
everything is constructed.

821
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:47,046
So I think that's a lovely move, because

822
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:49,048
once you've gone scale free, you then

823
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:52,051
start to ask deep questions about how you

824
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,053
couple one scale to another scale.

825
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:58,057
And in a sense, ecosystems is just that.

826
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:02,055
How do the denizens of an ecosystem, how

827
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:03,056
is it constituted?

828
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:04,057
How is it co constructed?

829
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:06,059
What is the structure of it?

830
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,060
These are all questions about how one

831
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,062
scale links to another scale.

832
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:11,064
So I think there have been lots of

833
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:13,066
advances in that direction in many, many

834
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,067
different fronts.

835
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:17,070
And you can read that either in terms of

836
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,073
coupling, difference of spatial or

837
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:22,075
spatial scales, but probably more

838
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:25,078
importantly, sort of temporal scales.

839
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:29,082
And you see that wherever you look, you'

840
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:32,085
'll just come back to what do you mean by

841
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,086
a narrative?

842
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:37,090
It is exactly I think, as I said, it's

843
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,091
just a plan.

844
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:40,093
It's just a story.

845
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:42,095
But notice the story has a temporal

846
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,096
aspect to it.

847
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:45,098
I have narratives about being a good

848
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:48,101
person, being a good father, being a good

849
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:48,101
scientist.

850
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:51,104
I also have narratives about I want my

851
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,106
cup of coffee, or I have to go look after

852
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:56,109
the I don't, but Ralph has to go look

853
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:57,110
after the child.

854
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,107
So we've all got narratives at very, very

855
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,109
different timescales.

856
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:04,111
And of course, if you're I just came back

857
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:07,114
to Bert's example of I'm an autonomous

858
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,116
vehicle and I'm sentient and we're five

859
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,118
years into the future, and I have to

860
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,120
drive around the roundabout.

861
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,123
What temporal scale and what kind of

862
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:20,127
temporal course grading to define the

863
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,130
narratives necessary with narratives

864
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,133
would be appropriate for that kind of

865
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:30,137
situation and the ensuing planning.

866
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,142
Short answer to your question.

867
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,144
I think there have been many, many

868
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,145
advances.

869
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,149
I think what they've had in common is

870
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:45,152
basically transcending either different

871
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,154
domains, but in particular different

872
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,155
scales of application.

873
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,158
I also agree with the notion.

874
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:54,161
Well, another I think, important and

875
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:57,164
pragmatic advance is something that Bert

876
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:00,161
mentioned, which is democratization of

877
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,162
this technology.

878
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:05,166
I think Ralph also hinted at this is the

879
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,169
time you start using this for the common

880
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:08,169
good.

881
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:10,171
So.

882
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:16,177
I think things like RX infer and PMDP.

883
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:18,179
And I didn't know about the Gaia project,

884
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,181
but it sounds as though there's been

885
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,183
great advances there as well.

886
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:24,185
So this kind of democratization, I think,

887
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:26,187
is really important, this sort of

888
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:29,190
socialization where everybody can play

889
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,192
and start to sort of not talk past each

890
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:32,193
other.

891
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:36,197
I think that's a very important advance.

892
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:39,200
Curt: And did you say the word scale

893
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,202
invariance or scale independence?

894
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:43,204
Karl: I said scale invariant.

895
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:45,206
I actually said scale free, and I shouldn'

896
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,207
't have done that.

897
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,212
I said scale free.

898
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,215
So the idea that you can apply exactly

899
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:57,218
the same mechanics and literally, for

900
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:00,215
example, say, from Bert's perspective,

901
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,217
the same kind of message passing at

902
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:05,220
different space time scales or at

903
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,223
different levels in a hierarchical model.

904
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:08,223
.

905
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:12,227
So I've actually got a question for Bert

906
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:16,231
in terms of reactive message passing,

907
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:19,234
because reactive means that you don't

908
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:23,238
have to prescribe the scheduling, but in

909
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:27,242
addressing the problems or the issues

910
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:30,245
that entailed, by having to specify the

911
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:34,249
scheduling of talking or of message

912
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:38,253
passing, you're bound to deal with time.

913
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:41,256
And in a scale invariant context, or

914
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:45,260
nested with nested scales, for example,

915
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,263
you have to deal with the separation of

916
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:49,264
temporal scales.

917
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:52,267
So I think there's going to be a very

918
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:53,268
important generic question, which

919
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:56,271
technically Bert will have been thinking

920
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:58,273
about furiously for the past few years,

921
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:01,270
but I think implicitly, we're all going

922
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,274
to have to be addressing soon, which is,

923
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,276
how do you put the timing of your

924
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:11,280
messages when you make a move or when you

925
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,283
listen to a patient, or when you actually

926
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:17,286
pass a message on a Factograph?

927
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:22,291
How are we going to be able to put the

928
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,293
separation of timescales into the

929
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:28,297
architecture in a way that speaks to this

930
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:28,297
scale

931
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:32,301
invariance. The Gear project, for example,

932
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:36,305
, how do you integrate live feed from

933
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:40,309
traffic flow sensors with fluctuations in

934
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:42,310
the climate?

935
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:46,315
This kind of data comes at very, very

936
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:50,319
different temporal scales and yet has to

937
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,322
be assimilated and modeled in a way that

938
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:57,326
also, I think, has to know due courtesy

939
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:01,324
to that separation of temporal scales.

940
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:04,327
Curt: Bert, could you please recapitulate

941
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:06,329
the question for the audience and then

942
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:07,330
begin to answer it?

943
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:10,333
Bert: Okay, yeah.

944
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:14,337
The issue is active instance agents are

945
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:18,341
nested agents, and the higher levels

946
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:22,345
supposed to operate on a larger temporal

947
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:26,349
scale, but they are also working at a

948
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,351
lower resolution.

949
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:31,354
If you look far ahead, you don't care as

950
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:34,357
much about precision, not at a centimeter

951
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
level.

952
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:37,359
When I go around a roundabout, I don't

953
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,362
care at the centimeter where I land, but

954
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:41,364
for the next few milliseconds, I do care

955
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:43,366
because it may mean the difference

956
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,368
between getting in the ditch or not.

957
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:51,374
So the higher level, I want to look very

958
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:54,377
deep ahead, but I don't want to send

959
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:57,380
every millisecond a message to go to look,

960
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,382
, let's say, a minute ahead.

961
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:03,380
So I need to space it out a lot, but then

962
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,382
I may miss things.

963
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:08,385
So preferably you would just send

964
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:10,387
inaccurate messages.

965
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,390
But that only works if you actually have

966
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,392
a method to also, let's say, use less

967
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:18,395
computational power to compute a less

968
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:20,397
accurate message.

969
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:23,400
And we're not good at that yet.

970
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:28,405
What we are thinking about is there's a

971
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:31,408
new field or a new field, but there's a

972
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:35,412
field called probabilistic numerics where.

973
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:38,415
... We are used in math to just compute

974
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:41,418
everything very precisely or as precise

975
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:44,421
as possible and do not care about how

976
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:47,424
much computation we spend on it.

977
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:51,428
So in probabilistic numerics, I hope we

978
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,430
can leverage this for message

979
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,431
computations.

980
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:58,435
I would like to spend, let's say,

981
00:44:58,435 --> 00:45:01,432
proportionally less computational power

982
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,435
on the accuracy of a message.

983
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,438
One way possibly would be to consider a

984
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,441
message a latent variable that has

985
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,443
uncertainty by itself.

986
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,447
But I don't have a totally clear answer

987
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,449
for Karl because we haven't solved that

988
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,450
either.

989
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,454
But there is a problem in, let's say,

990
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:27,458
what we do on... Our computers were so

991
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:31,462
completely different from computers, let'

992
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:35,466
's say, from the from the from the brain,

993
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,469
that, yeah, we are spending we're

994
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,472
spending just too many computations on

995
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:45,476
messages that in the end are very

996
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,477
inaccurate.

997
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,480
And that's a problem in what we do on our

998
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,482
computers currently.

999
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:54,485
Yeah.

1000
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,488
So I don't know how we go what you want

1001
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,490
to do with this on the higher level.

1002
00:46:00,485 --> 00:46:02,487
If you want to look maybe ten times

1003
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:05,490
farther ahead and spend about the same

1004
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,493
amount of computation on the lower level,

1005
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:11,495
that's sort of our goal.

1006
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:14,499
But we don't have an answer for that

1007
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:15,500
either at the moment.

1008
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:20,505
Curt: And, Anna, so please feel free to

1009
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:22,507
comment on or ask a question to anyone.

1010
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:26,511
Anna: I don't I don't have anything to

1011
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:29,514
contribute, unfortunately, to how

1012
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:30,515
computers work.

1013
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:32,517
But I can tell you that this idea of

1014
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:35,520
temporal scales is something that we face

1015
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,522
often in our work with patients.

1016
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:40,525
For example, addicted patients are very

1017
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:43,528
focused on short term rewards and, in

1018
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:46,531
fact, their ability to control how they

1019
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,533
feel in the moment, that is partially

1020
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,535
what drives the addiction.

1021
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:53,538
So when I try to adopt Ural's language of

1022
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:56,541
minimizing surprise or minimizing free

1023
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,543
entropy, that's one of the things that

1024
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:01,540
people are trying to do on a short term

1025
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,542
time scale when they become addicted.

1026
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:06,545
So I have a young woman who's addicted to

1027
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:08,547
nitrous oxide, which has a very fast

1028
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,549
onset of intoxication over the order of

1029
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:13,552
seconds and a very fast offset, and she

1030
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:15,554
says that that's exactly what she likes

1031
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:17,556
about it, because she's controlling it

1032
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:19,558
second by second.

1033
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:22,561
So when we work with patients to get them

1034
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:25,564
out of that short temporal horizon, we

1035
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:28,567
actually rely more and more on action and

1036
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,569
having them change something in their

1037
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:33,572
lives, namely abstain from their drug of

1038
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,574
choice for long

1039
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:38,577
enough to kind of completely reset their

1040
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:41,580
brains and to allow them to see this

1041
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,583
longer temporal. Because when they're

1042
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,585
chasing this short control, they're

1043
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:49,588
actually not able to see themselves in

1044
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:53,592
the longer narrative arc of their lives.

1045
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:56,595
So that's what comes to mind for me.

1046
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:58,597
I don't think it's going to be helpful to

1047
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:00,593
people who are trying to build computers,

1048
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:02,595
but that's the kinds of interventions

1049
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:03,596
that I make with humans.

1050
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:05,598
Curt: I have a question about that.

1051
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:08,601
So you mentioned control in the short

1052
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:11,604
term, and you've also mentioned that you

1053
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:14,606
study the positive effects of having a

1054
00:48:14,606 --> 00:48:16,609
higher power in your life or surrender.

1055
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
Okay.

1056
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,611
I kind of gave the punchline away by

1057
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:20,613
saying surrendering to the higher power.

1058
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:22,615
Where I was going was, okay -

1059
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:25,618
What's the association between seeing

1060
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:27,620
yourself in the largest time frame and a

1061
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,621
higher power?

1062
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:31,624
And then also is there something that is

1063
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:34,627
akin to giving up control when you look

1064
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:37,630
farther and farther into the future?

1065
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,632
Anna: Yeah! Such a great - yeah, that's

1066
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,634
at the heart of what I'm very interested

1067
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:43,636
in, because it's a real paradox, right?

1068
00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:46,639
It's this kind of locus of control within

1069
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,641
ourselves that really, in modern culture,

1070
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,643
we think is a great thing.

1071
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:52,645
But when that's taken to an extreme and

1072
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:54,647
one example of that is addictive

1073
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:55,648
behaviors,

1074
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:57,650
it's very bad for people and for

1075
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,651
communities.

1076
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:01,648
And so what can pull people out of that

1077
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,650
is this kind of surrender to a higher

1078
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,653
power, giving up that locus of control,

1079
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,655
locating that locus of control outside

1080
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,658
themselves, not necessarily like in a

1081
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,660
theistic sense. One of the things that

1082
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,663
they talk about in Alcoholics Anonymous,

1083
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,666
for example, is you don't have to believe

1084
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,667
in God.

1085
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,668
It's just not you.

1086
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:23,670
You're not driving it.

1087
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,673
And so I would be very curious, from the

1088
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,675
perspective of your-all's [?]

1089
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:31,678
understanding of active inference and the

1090
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:33,680
free energy principle and how the brain

1091
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,683
works, why is it that sort of embracing

1092
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:39,686
our inability to control what happens in

1093
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,688
our lives can actually be the very source

1094
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:44,691
of healing, especially embedded in this

1095
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,694
really kind of over controlled,

1096
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:49,696
I would even go so far as to say

1097
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,698
endemically narcissistic culture.

1098
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:52,699
I'm really curious.

1099
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,702
I don't want to take the conversation in

1100
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:56,703
a direction...

1101
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,705
Curt: Please! That's a fantastic question.

1102
00:49:58,705 --> 00:49:58,705
.

1103
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,702
So if anyone has a comment on that,

1104
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
please.

1105
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:09,710
Rafael: I have some thoughts, and I think

1106
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,714
this applies both at the personal level

1107
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,716
and at the global level.

1108
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:18,719
And I think it has to do with my quote

1109
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,722
from earlier by Edward Fulbrook that if

1110
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:23,724
you're falling from a plane, yes, maybe

1111
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:26,727
an altimeter and some instruments might

1112
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:29,730
be useful, but what you really need is a

1113
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,731
parachute.

1114
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
Right?

1115
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:34,735
So we have this presupposition that

1116
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:38,739
whatever framing we have operating in our

1117
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:42,743
day to day is going to be, okay:

1118
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:43,744
This is the right framing.

1119
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:47,748
And it tends to be this rational,

1120
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:52,753
scientific framing of very linear cause

1121
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:56,757
and consequence for most stuff.

1122
00:50:57,758 --> 00:50:59,760
And it turns out that even if you inspect

1123
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,757
our day to day behavior, bigger, more

1124
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:04,759
complicated models are not necessarily

1125
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:07,762
better, which is where we get the success

1126
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:10,765
of heuristics under bounded computation,

1127
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:11,766
bounded rationality.

1128
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,770
And if you scale it up to 8 billion

1129
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,774
humans interacted in resource constrained

1130
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:23,778
planet, a world of possibilities, but

1131
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:25,780
also of challenges,

1132
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,784
then we have to drastically lower

1133
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:32,786
Guillaume: our

1134
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:35,790
Rafael: bar for, yes, how much macro we

1135
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:35,790
have.

1136
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,793
But also even where does information

1137
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:41,796
gathering reach diminishing returns?

1138
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:43,798
Where does modeling reach diminishing

1139
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:44,799
returns?

1140
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,801
There's a whole literature in the

1141
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,803
business world about the expected value

1142
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:50,805
of information, how much you should

1143
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:51,806
actually invest.

1144
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:54,809
Also in science is also known as optimal

1145
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:57,812
experiment design, where basically

1146
00:51:57,812 --> 00:51:59,814
acknowledging that you have limited

1147
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:02,811
budget in terms of how much you can act

1148
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:05,814
and how much you can probe and how much

1149
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:08,817
time you can spend thinking about stuff.

1150
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:12,821
And I think what we're doing when we feel

1151
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:15,824
like, burned out or exhausted from

1152
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:19,828
overthinking, we're innately feeling that,

1153
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:22,831
, okay, we've gone too high and we need

1154
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:25,834
to give ourselves a vacation, give

1155
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:29,837
ourselves some free time here.

1156
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,840
I think that doing this principle in a

1157
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,843
principled way, we're just not just like,

1158
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:37,846
taking the heuristics and the signals

1159
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:40,849
that we inherit from evolution, but

1160
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:42,851
actually being able to figure out

1161
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:45,854
collaboratively and with some rigor.

1162
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:50,858
Okay, we don't need to know exactly how

1163
00:52:50,858 --> 00:52:54,863
many degrees the world is going to warm

1164
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:56,865
by 2000 and 2100.

1165
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:58,867
In order to know that maybe it's a good

1166
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:00,863
idea to start doing something about the

1167
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:02,865
amount of carbon in the atmosphere or

1168
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:03,866
whatever.

1169
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:04,867
Right?

1170
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:08,871
And so I think this leads to this idea of

1171
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,874
a real knowledge economy and of things

1172
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:13,876
like abstraction as a service.

1173
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:19,882
How can you actually build in these kind

1174
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:22,885
of sophisticated, sophisticated

1175
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:27,890
translation layers that take some of this

1176
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,893
burden from ourselves as individuals and

1177
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:34,897
even as organizations, right?

1178
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:37,900
And just put it out in the world as value

1179
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,902
added services, which is what they are.

1180
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:43,906
Curt: And Guillaume, if you have any

1181
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:46,909
statements or questions or retorts, then

1182
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:47,910
please feel free.

1183
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:49,912
Guillaume: Yeah, thanks.

1184
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:52,915
Now, I was still also thinking about the

1185
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:55,918
recent breakthrough post 2020 in Action

1186
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:56,919
France.

1187
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,918
To me, there were theoretical progress

1188
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:03,920
that were very interesting.

1189
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,923
We heard already about the formalism

1190
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:08,925
maturity at the mathematical level

1191
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:11,928
between multiscale and scale free aspects.

1192
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
.

1193
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:15,932
I really liked also the development of a

1194
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:17,934
more multi agent perspective of active

1195
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:18,935
insurance.

1196
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:22,939
It's very interesting, especially like,

1197
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:26,943
for instance, seeing multi agent systems.

1198
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:26,943
.

1199
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:29,946
We just heard about even society as a

1200
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:32,949
wall, like as many as one system or many

1201
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:36,953
as many subsystems, and how we can use

1202
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:39,956
maybe those formalisms to also deal with

1203
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:41,957
policy making.

1204
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:44,961
That's very interesting venue and the

1205
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:46,963
emergence of norms, culture and ideas

1206
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:47,964
also.

1207
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:50,966
Because one thing that I'm still

1208
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:52,969
struggling with in the case of active

1209
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:55,972
insurance models is like how to get

1210
00:54:55,972 --> 00:54:57,974
outside the checkerboard.

1211
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:02,973
You can put a lot in the model, a priory,

1212
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:05,976
and how you make the model, creating new

1213
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:08,979
stuff that is not becked inside.

1214
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:10,981
At the first and on that one very

1215
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:13,984
interesting breakthrough was the

1216
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:15,986
application of active inference to

1217
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:17,988
morphogenesis.

1218
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:20,991
I really like the work that has been done

1219
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:22,993
on that and on the technical aspects.

1220
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:25,996
I think the two main focus that I love

1221
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:29,000
are all the deep active inference and how

1222
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,003
to scale up active inference because it's

1223
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:36,007
a strong limitation for the adoption of

1224
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:39,010
the formalism if it's not scaled enough

1225
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,013
compared to other framework like deep

1226
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:45,016
learning and then the link with empirical

1227
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:46,017
data.

1228
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:49,020
I really like, for instance, the work of

1229
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,023
Ryan Smith and how to connect with

1230
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:55,026
electrophysiology and clinical data.

1231
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:58,029
And I think it's also something very

1232
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:01,026
important to anchor the theory in the

1233
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:05,030
real world and have falsifiability and

1234
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,033
empirical validation of those models.

1235
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:10,035
Curt: And what are some of the

1236
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:12,037
applications of active inference to.

1237
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,041
Guillaume: So?

1238
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,043
Well, I'm not the expert here.

1239
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:20,045
Karl would be the best to answer that.

1240
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:24,049
But I was referring to the work with

1241
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:27,052
Michael Levin and how a model can help to

1242
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:31,055
create a sort of embryogenesis.

1243
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:35,060
So maybe, Karl, you can explain better

1244
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,062
than me, please.

1245
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:41,066
Karl: I don't have a reputation for

1246
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:44,069
explaining things very clearly, but yeah,

1247
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:45,070
that's absolutely right.

1248
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:50,075
It was just at work with Michael Evan and

1249
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:54,079
colleagues showing that you can get quite

1250
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,082
expressive and bimimetic pattern

1251
00:56:57,082 --> 00:57:01,080
formation and movement of different cells

1252
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,084
into an organization often described in

1253
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:08,087
terms of morphogenesis simply by

1254
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:12,091
communicating your beliefs.

1255
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:14,093
So I'm coming back to this sort of cross

1256
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:16,095
cutting theme of communication.

1257
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:20,099
So if you just broadcast your beliefs and

1258
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:23,101
you're a little cell and there are a

1259
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:25,104
little ensemble of cells, and they all

1260
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:28,107
have the shared generative model that

1261
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:31,110
includes if I was in this position, I

1262
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,112
would sense that.

1263
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:36,115
Now, they all have exactly the same

1264
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:39,118
generative model, the same predictions,

1265
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:42,120
the same expectations, and they're all

1266
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,123
broadcasting their beliefs about where

1267
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:45,124
they are.

1268
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:49,128
And the free energy minimizing solution

1269
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:52,131
is just when they're all in a place such

1270
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:56,135
that they receive signals that they would

1271
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:59,138
expect to receive when they're in this

1272
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:00,133
place.

1273
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:02,135
And of course, if that is the same for

1274
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:04,137
everybody, there's only one arrangement

1275
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:06,139
where each cell finds its place.

1276
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:10,143
So basically, knowing your place is an

1277
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:13,146
emergent property of making the world

1278
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:17,150
mutually predictable through, yeah, a

1279
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,153
deflationary account of morphogenesis.

1280
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:25,158
But Gim, I thought one of your units is

1281
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:27,160
precision psychiatry.

1282
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,161
So I thought you're going to talk about

1283
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:30,163
precision, so I'm going to do a Guillem.

1284
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:33,166
Now, he talked about morphogenesis, I'm

1285
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,168
going to talk about precision.

1286
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:35,168
Now.

1287
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:39,172
I think that's a really nice way just to

1288
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:43,176
pick up on themes which everybody's just

1289
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:46,179
mentioned, in particular the pathology of

1290
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:47,180
precision.

1291
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:50,183
And by precision you can read precision

1292
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:53,186
in the sense that Bert was talking about

1293
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:56,189
in terms of do you use an unsigned

1294
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:57,190
integer or a double?

1295
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,187
How much can I coarse grain to my numeric

1296
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,188
representation?

1297
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:03,190
Or you can use it in terms of coarse

1298
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:05,192
grading in the sense of the

1299
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:08,195
renormalization group chunking things in

1300
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:10,197
hours or years as opposed to milliseconds

1301
00:59:10,197 --> 00:59:11,198
and minutes.

1302
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:14,201
Or you can look at it in terms of a

1303
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:17,204
statistician describing the reliability

1304
00:59:17,204 --> 00:59:21,208
or the inverse variance of a signal.

1305
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:24,211
And of course we have to estimate that

1306
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:27,214
when I say we I mean your agents and

1307
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:30,217
statisticians and act accordingly.

1308
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:34,221
And certainly in the work of Ryan Smith

1309
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:37,224
on addiction, much of the sort of

1310
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:40,227
mathematical explanation for these

1311
00:59:40,227 --> 00:59:43,230
addictive locked in OCD like phenomena

1312
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,233
rests upon a failure to get that course

1313
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:50,237
grading that precision estimation right.

1314
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:55,242
The reason I wonder whether it be just

1315
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:57,244
worthwhile revisiting addiction and

1316
00:59:57,244 --> 01:00:01,048
psychopathology or certainly pathology of

1317
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:03,601
behavior from the point of view of

1318
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:06,379
getting precision wrong and certainly

1319
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:09,045
assigning too much precision to low level

1320
01:00:09,045 --> 01:00:12,338
processing, which is what Bert wants to

1321
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:13,481
avoid doing.

1322
01:00:15,606 --> 01:00:17,836
It just strikes me that that kind of

1323
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:20,098
story also has mileage in terms of why we

1324
01:00:20,098 --> 01:00:22,359
are in a state of paralysis when it comes

1325
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:25,621
to climate change because I also noticed,

1326
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:27,876
Guillermo, that you talked about climate

1327
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:28,953
action.

1328
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,173
I've never heard that before, but that

1329
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:32,395
seems to me to be the important thing.

1330
01:00:33,406 --> 01:00:36,730
Why isn't there any climate, Anna?

1331
01:00:36,738 --> 01:00:38,933
You know, it'll be like you going to the

1332
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:40,137
clinic and finding someone with Parkinson'

1333
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:40,191
's disease.

1334
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:42,386
Why isn't this person moving?

1335
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:47,852
And interestingly, the computational

1336
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,128
explanation for Parkinson's disease is

1337
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:52,382
assigning too much precision to the

1338
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,657
evidence that you're not moving before

1339
01:00:55,657 --> 01:00:56,752
you move.

1340
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,985
So if you can't ignore the fact that

1341
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:01,601
nothing is changing, all your prior

1342
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:03,847
beliefs, your predictions that I am going

1343
01:01:03,847 --> 01:01:05,092
to stand up or going to initiate walking,

1344
01:01:05,092 --> 01:01:08,308
don't get a looking because they are

1345
01:01:08,308 --> 01:01:10,524
immediately cancelled because you've

1346
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:12,763
assigned too much precision to the lower

1347
01:01:12,763 --> 01:01:14,908
level processing.

1348
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:17,279
And I'm just wondering whether that kind

1349
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:21,612
of pathology is exactly what Ralph is

1350
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:24,945
trying to reverse by having models at

1351
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:27,251
hand, recommendations at hand that

1352
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:30,584
provide a more coarse grained view of

1353
01:01:30,584 --> 01:01:33,827
things, a deeper view.

1354
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:37,281
Curt: Anna, would you like to comment

1355
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,299
on?

1356
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:43,798
Anna: I love this idea of the pathology

1357
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:46,014
of precision because I think it manifests

1358
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:49,049
in so many different ways not just among

1359
01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:53,081
my patient population but I think it's

1360
01:01:53,081 --> 01:01:56,117
almost like a cultural sickness, in a way.

1361
01:01:56,117 --> 01:01:57,121
.

1362
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:01,104
The ways in which we seem, like obsessed

1363
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:04,132
with certain types of data and we're

1364
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:06,152
missing the big picture.

1365
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:08,175
So I'm going to think more about that.

1366
01:02:08,176 --> 01:02:10,191
I'm going to read more about it.

1367
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,209
I really appreciate the discussion.

1368
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,235
It's interesting for me and Adam when.

1369
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:17,260
Curt: You'Re referring to the pathology

1370
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,285
of precision, do you mean so in a more

1371
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:21,304
conscious sense that we're over

1372
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,330
evaluating something that we don't need

1373
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:24,334
to?

1374
01:02:24,336 --> 01:02:27,362
Whereas, Karl, you're referring to it in

1375
01:02:27,362 --> 01:02:29,386
an unconscious sense like the brain is

1376
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:32,411
putting too much precision on something

1377
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:34,437
because in Parkinson's it's not like you

1378
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:37,461
consciously are putting precision in a

1379
01:02:37,461 --> 01:02:37,468
place.

1380
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:41,505
Anna: Well, I think you could look at it

1381
01:02:41,505 --> 01:02:43,521
sort of like in both cases.

1382
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:46,551
When I think about addiction, people aren'

1383
01:02:46,551 --> 01:02:47,566
't doing it consciously.

1384
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:50,591
It's that they really do see this as

1385
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:52,616
adaptive and healthy and also even on

1386
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:55,644
some level that they can't do otherwise.

1387
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:57,669
And they're not able to see the true

1388
01:02:57,669 --> 01:03:00,633
impact of their drug use on their lives.

1389
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:02,656
They're genuinely not able to see the

1390
01:03:02,656 --> 01:03:04,670
negative consequences.

1391
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:07,702
And that's what contributes to getting

1392
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:09,720
caught in that vortex.

1393
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:12,754
But I mean, you could also see it as part

1394
01:03:12,754 --> 01:03:14,776
of what's happened culturally.

1395
01:03:14,777 --> 01:03:16,799
Like, for example, the whole wellness

1396
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,823
industrial complex, the way that we now

1397
01:03:19,823 --> 01:03:21,842
count ourselves through all these

1398
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:22,855
different devices.

1399
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:25,882
And if we could just count our breathing

1400
01:03:25,882 --> 01:03:27,904
and count our heart rate and take

1401
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,931
supplements, then we would somehow reach

1402
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:32,959
some levitating state of precise wellness.

1403
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:33,961
.

1404
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:37,000
I don't know, this is all kind of new

1405
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,015
ideas for me.

1406
01:03:39,021 --> 01:03:39,029
Curt: That's interesting.

1407
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:42,056
So you believe that we can be inundated

1408
01:03:42,056 --> 01:03:45,082
with health data and that's detrimental

1409
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:45,088
to us?

1410
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:46,098
Anna: Oh, absolutely.

1411
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:48,116
I see that all the time.

1412
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:51,148
Curt: So for me, I used to have maybe I'

1413
01:03:51,148 --> 01:03:54,172
'll take this out of the well, this is

1414
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:55,182
going out live.

1415
01:03:55,186 --> 01:03:59,220
Okay, let me figure out how to say this

1416
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,174
diplomatically.

1417
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:02,194
I used to have a device that would

1418
01:04:02,194 --> 01:04:04,218
measure my heart rate, let's say that and

1419
01:04:04,218 --> 01:04:05,224
my sleep.

1420
01:04:05,225 --> 01:04:07,248
And instead of improving my sleep, it led

1421
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:10,270
to me becoming obsessed with it and then

1422
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,289
noticing, oh, I didn't sleep well.

1423
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,309
I must not be feeling good today as well

1424
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:15,325
because apparently there's a high

1425
01:04:15,325 --> 01:04:17,345
connection between how your sleep quality

1426
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:17,348
and.

1427
01:04:17,348 --> 01:04:20,376
Anna: How well you plus added to that the

1428
01:04:20,376 --> 01:04:23,401
other layer that I should be able to

1429
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,410
control it.

1430
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:24,416
Right.

1431
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:27,441
So with all of this data and information,

1432
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:29,466
I should be able to, I don't know, reduce

1433
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,491
free entropy or whatever, reduce surprise,

1434
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:33,507
, as you guys talk about.

1435
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:37,545
And I think that's obviously that only

1436
01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:39,569
goes so far and then can actually

1437
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:42,598
contribute to our misery because why aren'

1438
01:04:42,598 --> 01:04:45,626
't we all levitating like the Buddha or

1439
01:04:45,626 --> 01:04:48,655
whatever when we have all these tools and

1440
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:51,684
we can pay attention to all this data?

1441
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:55,723
Curt: I see this also with people who

1442
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:56,738
have productivity tools.

1443
01:04:57,745 --> 01:05:00,713
Not only that, but mechanical keyboards.

1444
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,735
Let's say the reason why I don't have a

1445
01:05:02,735 --> 01:05:04,756
mechanical keyboard, even though I think

1446
01:05:04,756 --> 01:05:06,777
I'd love it, is because I know that why

1447
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,797
the heck do I care about the clicking

1448
01:05:08,797 --> 01:05:10,810
sound of a keyboard?

1449
01:05:10,811 --> 01:05:11,827
But if I got one, then I'd be like, well,

1450
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:13,843
what's the difference between clicking

1451
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:14,858
sound A versus clicking sound B versus

1452
01:05:14,858 --> 01:05:15,866
clicking sound C?

1453
01:05:15,867 --> 01:05:17,885
And I'd become obsessed with the

1454
01:05:17,885 --> 01:05:19,904
trappings of productivity that is

1455
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:21,926
sharpening, so called sharpening the axe

1456
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:23,947
rather than cutting down the tree.

1457
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:26,973
There's this phrase that is apocryphal.

1458
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:29,002
And it said it's attributed to, I think,

1459
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:32,031
Lincoln, which is that he'd spend 80% of

1460
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:35,060
his time or half the time sharpening the

1461
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,082
knife than cutting the tree.

1462
01:05:38,097 --> 01:05:40,114
And then this is just echoed in

1463
01:05:40,114 --> 01:05:42,136
productivity circles, but it can't be the

1464
01:05:42,136 --> 01:05:43,139
case.

1465
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:44,154
Why would you spend so much time

1466
01:05:44,154 --> 01:05:45,162
sharpening your axe?

1467
01:05:45,162 --> 01:05:46,178
Like, look at anyone who cuts down a tree

1468
01:05:46,178 --> 01:05:47,183
with an axe.

1469
01:05:47,183 --> 01:05:50,210
Most of the time they're not doing that

1470
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:50,216
anyhow.

1471
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:55,262
So if anyone has any comments on what was

1472
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:57,287
just said, please can I.

1473
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,254
Bert: Just talk what I find exciting in

1474
01:06:00,254 --> 01:06:01,268
my field about access?

1475
01:06:01,268 --> 01:06:05,300
Sure, yes, I read it's a long time ago,

1476
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,333
but there was a paper and it's about that

1477
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:11,363
it says, well, active inference is not

1478
01:06:11,363 --> 01:06:14,393
really a scientific loop because it's

1479
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:15,402
biased.

1480
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:19,449
And I read that, and the sound of the

1481
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:23,482
paper was kind of so it's not good.

1482
01:06:23,486 --> 01:06:26,516
But I think active inference is maybe not

1483
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:27,527
a science loop.

1484
01:06:27,528 --> 01:06:29,548
It's an engineering loop because there's

1485
01:06:29,548 --> 01:06:31,569
bias, and we need bias in engineering.

1486
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:32,577
We need to make stuff.

1487
01:06:32,577 --> 01:06:33,586
We need to build stuff.

1488
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:35,600
We need to have a bias.

1489
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:37,627
So it's an engineering design cycle.

1490
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:40,656
I see that everywhere around me.

1491
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,709
And active inference could be a complete

1492
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:49,740
breakthrough in in engineering.

1493
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:49,746
Right.

1494
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:53,781
The fields around me are signal

1495
01:06:53,781 --> 01:06:54,792
processing.

1496
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:57,823
I am myself in a signal processing

1497
01:06:57,823 --> 01:07:01,800
department or group, and everybody builds

1498
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,811
algorithms.

1499
01:07:02,816 --> 01:07:03,827
For us.

1500
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:05,847
In active inference agents, it's

1501
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:07,860
inference over states.

1502
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,885
Then the floor below me, they build

1503
01:07:09,885 --> 01:07:10,897
control systems.

1504
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:12,916
Well, it's inference over actions.

1505
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,944
Then other people are working on machine

1506
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:16,950
learning.

1507
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,968
It's inference over parameters.

1508
01:07:18,979 --> 01:07:21,002
Active inference could be and you like

1509
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:22,010
this, Curt.

1510
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,038
It's a very deflationary view on

1511
01:07:24,038 --> 01:07:28,072
engineering, because everything is just

1512
01:07:28,072 --> 01:07:29,083
inference.

1513
01:07:29,085 --> 01:07:32,118
And so rather than building algorithms

1514
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:36,153
everywhere, if we become really good at

1515
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:39,186
implementing minimization, we will be

1516
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:43,221
able to build a great engineering design

1517
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:46,256
cycles, and we'll be engineering better

1518
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:50,289
machines for medical procedures or for

1519
01:07:50,289 --> 01:07:53,323
other things that are important.

1520
01:07:53,325 --> 01:07:56,353
So it has a tremendous application

1521
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,374
potential in engineering.

1522
01:07:59,384 --> 01:08:02,352
In engineering, and I think in many

1523
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:05,381
fields, people have sort of drifted in

1524
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,399
different directions.

1525
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:08,419
Control theorists have.

1526
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,438
I mean, they do almost the same thing as

1527
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:12,457
signal processing people, but they speak

1528
01:08:12,457 --> 01:08:13,467
a different language.

1529
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:14,474
Karl: Now.

1530
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:20,538
Bert: Signal processing people, it's a

1531
01:08:20,538 --> 01:08:22,559
completely different group for the

1532
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:25,582
machine learning people, but it's all

1533
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:27,606
information processing, and this field

1534
01:08:27,606 --> 01:08:29,622
can bring it together.

1535
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:37,700
But the thing is that in order to make it

1536
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,738
successful in engineering, we need to

1537
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:44,776
build an application that impresses.

1538
01:08:44,776 --> 01:08:45,783
Right?

1539
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:47,809
It's not like a TicTacToe thing.

1540
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:51,841
It really needs to impress people, needs

1541
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:54,870
to be better than some other control

1542
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,877
systems.

1543
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,903
But once we do that, I think there is

1544
01:08:57,903 --> 01:08:59,928
tremendous application potential because

1545
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:02,894
there haven't been enormous breakthroughs

1546
01:09:02,894 --> 01:09:04,916
in signal processing and control.

1547
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:07,946
The last big breakthrough, I think, was

1548
01:09:07,946 --> 01:09:10,975
Kalmont filtering, and this was 1960s.

1549
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:14,015
It's kind of funny that the essence of

1550
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:16,035
what we do in active influence is also

1551
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:17,045
carbon filtering.

1552
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:23,104
I think there's tremendous opportunities

1553
01:09:23,104 --> 01:09:26,135
for what we do here for engineering.

1554
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:30,173
That's why it's exciting to me.

1555
01:09:31,188 --> 01:09:33,206
Curt: Anna, do you mind expanding on what

1556
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:34,216
you said about acting?

1557
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:36,236
And therapists should be helping their

1558
01:09:36,236 --> 01:09:37,246
patients with that.

1559
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:39,262
Anna: Oh, sure.

1560
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:39,268
Just so.

1561
01:09:39,268 --> 01:09:42,298
I mean, one of my critiques of mental

1562
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:45,328
health treatment today is that there's

1563
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:48,359
not enough encouragement of patients to

1564
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,389
actually go and act differently in the

1565
01:09:51,389 --> 01:09:54,418
world as a way of gathering data.

1566
01:09:55,419 --> 01:09:57,446
Instead, it often ends up being kind of

1567
01:09:57,446 --> 01:10:00,413
this world building between therapists

1568
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:03,441
and patients, not necessarily ultimately

1569
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:04,458
adaptive in the world.

1570
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:06,474
So I was really just kind of responding

1571
01:10:06,474 --> 01:10:08,490
to what Raft was saying, that we need to

1572
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:08,498
act in the world.

1573
01:10:08,498 --> 01:10:11,529
I think that's more true now in modern

1574
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:15,561
rich nations than ever before because we

1575
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:17,586
are so incredibly sedentary and

1576
01:10:17,586 --> 01:10:18,598
interacting.

1577
01:10:18,599 --> 01:10:21,623
Of course we're interacting with a

1578
01:10:21,623 --> 01:10:24,651
virtual world, and that's good and bad.

1579
01:10:24,652 --> 01:10:27,682
But I think we need to be actually acting

1580
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,692
in the world.

1581
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,746
Curt: And so there's different forms of

1582
01:10:33,746 --> 01:10:34,751
therapy.

1583
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:36,772
As you know, there's talk therapy, and

1584
01:10:36,772 --> 01:10:38,791
then there's also cognitive behavioral

1585
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,811
therapy or psychotherapy and sort of talk

1586
01:10:40,811 --> 01:10:40,817
therapy.

1587
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:43,842
But cognitive behavioral therapy, as far

1588
01:10:43,842 --> 01:10:45,865
as I understand, focuses on the actions.

1589
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:46,877
Is that incorrect?

1590
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:50,915
It also focuses on model buildings.

1591
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:54,954
Anna: On the cognition, again, treating

1592
01:10:54,954 --> 01:10:55,965
addiction.

1593
01:10:55,967 --> 01:10:57,986
You're not going to really get that far

1594
01:10:57,986 --> 01:10:59,003
with cognitive behavioral therapy or

1595
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:01,963
anything that's focused on just emotions

1596
01:11:01,963 --> 01:11:02,971
and cognitions.

1597
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:04,995
People have to go out and actually try

1598
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:07,021
stop using their stopping their substance

1599
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:09,045
or their addictive behaviors and gather

1600
01:11:09,045 --> 01:11:11,069
data from that experience and then come

1601
01:11:11,069 --> 01:11:13,084
back and process it.

1602
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:17,129
Curt: So, Anna, in your field and this

1603
01:11:17,129 --> 01:11:20,150
question will go to everyone, but in your

1604
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,170
field and what you study, where is the

1605
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:24,190
largest gap that you would like to see

1606
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:24,196
closed?

1607
01:11:25,206 --> 01:11:27,228
Anna: Well, I mean, we're facing a huge

1608
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:29,243
mental health crisis now.

1609
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:32,270
We have more and more young people coming

1610
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,296
in with depression, anxiety, suicidality,

1611
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:36,313
addictions of all sorts.

1612
01:11:36,313 --> 01:11:39,343
And these are not necessarily people who

1613
01:11:39,343 --> 01:11:42,371
are struggling by virtue of trauma or

1614
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,390
socioeconomic disparity.

1615
01:11:44,391 --> 01:11:45,406
These are people who have really

1616
01:11:45,406 --> 01:11:47,423
privileged lives in many instances.

1617
01:11:47,423 --> 01:11:51,463
So it's really a puzzle what is going on

1618
01:11:51,463 --> 01:11:52,475
for people.

1619
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:55,504
And I think a big part of it is the fact

1620
01:11:55,504 --> 01:11:57,528
that people are not having embodied

1621
01:11:57,528 --> 01:11:58,538
experiences.

1622
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:01,505
They're not having experiences in the

1623
01:12:01,505 --> 01:12:02,510
world.

1624
01:12:03,523 --> 01:12:06,555
And also the experiences that they are

1625
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:09,585
having are these kinds of very quick

1626
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:11,608
fixes and fast pleasures.

1627
01:12:14,632 --> 01:12:15,643
Curt: Are you noticing?

1628
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:17,669
Anna: I think the co created sort of

1629
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:20,696
models through healthier communication

1630
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:23,721
that allow people to feel part of a

1631
01:12:23,721 --> 01:12:25,747
community and also to have truthful co

1632
01:12:25,747 --> 01:12:27,764
created narratives.

1633
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:30,792
Trying to use the language here, I think

1634
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:32,809
that's really important.

1635
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:34,829
So, for example, one of the things Bert

1636
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:35,843
mentioned, what he's excited about?

1637
01:12:35,844 --> 01:12:37,864
One of the things I'm excited about in

1638
01:12:37,864 --> 01:12:39,886
the field of addiction medicine is mutual

1639
01:12:39,886 --> 01:12:41,908
support and the proliferation of things

1640
01:12:41,908 --> 01:12:44,930
like Alcoholics Anonymous, but also other

1641
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:45,948
mutual help groups, a lot of them

1642
01:12:45,948 --> 01:12:47,961
existing now online.

1643
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,988
And the way that people are together

1644
01:12:49,988 --> 01:12:52,015
creating healthier narratives and acted

1645
01:12:52,015 --> 01:12:55,040
together to counteract a lot of the

1646
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,065
unhealthy narratives that I think are

1647
01:12:57,065 --> 01:13:00,036
driving a lot of decision making today.

1648
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:05,080
Curt: I wanted to know, is there a

1649
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,106
correlation between the rise in mental

1650
01:13:07,106 --> 01:13:09,129
health or, sorry, mental illness or

1651
01:13:09,129 --> 01:13:12,156
mental health issues, whatever we want to

1652
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:15,184
call it, and a certain trait of people?

1653
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:20,231
Is it affecting the population the same?

1654
01:13:20,232 --> 01:13:22,254
So the whole population is raised 20% in

1655
01:13:22,254 --> 01:13:24,274
terms of how many mental health issues

1656
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:25,285
they have per year?

1657
01:13:25,286 --> 01:13:27,304
Or is it affecting people who deal with

1658
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:28,317
abstractions more and more?

1659
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:31,344
So, for instance, we're talking over zoom

1660
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:34,370
and some people study abstractions just

1661
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:34,376
like us.

1662
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:38,413
And then there are some people whose work

1663
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:41,443
it is to do something physical like

1664
01:13:41,443 --> 01:13:42,458
running or swim?

1665
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,479
Is it affecting everyone equally or are

1666
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:46,496
you noticing that there's some broad

1667
01:13:46,496 --> 01:13:47,500
trend?

1668
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:49,525
Anna: Well, the broad trends that are out

1669
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,543
there are just correlational, but the

1670
01:13:51,543 --> 01:13:53,559
more time that people spend in the

1671
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:54,578
virtual world, the more likely they are

1672
01:13:54,578 --> 01:13:56,596
to suffer from depression, anxiety and

1673
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:58,612
other mental health problems.

1674
01:13:59,627 --> 01:14:02,590
People haven't really been able to narrow

1675
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:04,611
that down to specific content, but they

1676
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:06,631
have been able to save just the sheer

1677
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:08,652
amount of time that spending that you're

1678
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,673
spending online increases your risk for

1679
01:14:10,673 --> 01:14:12,695
certain poor mental health outcomes.

1680
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:15,726
Curt: Okay.

1681
01:14:15,728 --> 01:14:18,753
Now, Karl well, again, if anyone has any

1682
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:20,778
comments or questions, please just raise

1683
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:22,791
your physical hand.

1684
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,833
I can see raph ralph Rafael sorry.

1685
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:29,864
Rafael: I was just going to say that I

1686
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:32,890
think another notable trend is, and I

1687
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:34,916
just saw somebody say this on YouTube

1688
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:37,942
just yesterday, that young people are

1689
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:39,968
disproportionately affected by things

1690
01:14:39,968 --> 01:14:42,995
like climate grief because they're the

1691
01:14:42,995 --> 01:14:45,023
ones that are going to be alive to deal

1692
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:46,033
with it.

1693
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:51,081
And I think that applies more generally

1694
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:54,111
that Peter Sanghi already like 30 years

1695
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,137
or something ago, wrote about the

1696
01:14:56,137 --> 01:14:59,166
Inescapable Network of neutrality, the

1697
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:02,134
reality that what we do affects each

1698
01:15:02,134 --> 01:15:03,143
other.

1699
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:03,148
Right?

1700
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:06,174
And we took advantage of this huge

1701
01:15:06,174 --> 01:15:08,198
resource buffer that's called the

1702
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:09,206
biosphere.

1703
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:12,237
Curt: And.

1704
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:15,267
Rafael: Earth to pretend that it didn't

1705
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:18,296
for quite a long time and got a lot of

1706
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:20,312
mileage out of it.

1707
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:23,344
But now we're at a point where there's a

1708
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:26,372
whole generation of people that are

1709
01:15:26,372 --> 01:15:29,402
coming to grips with the fact that I'm

1710
01:15:29,402 --> 01:15:32,435
going to stop myself from saying a square

1711
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:35,467
word, but oh my God, we actually need to

1712
01:15:35,467 --> 01:15:38,498
change everything about everything that

1713
01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:41,529
we do and we need to do it fast.

1714
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:44,553
By the way.

1715
01:15:48,593 --> 01:15:50,615
It's not just what we do out there, it's

1716
01:15:50,615 --> 01:15:52,637
also what we do inside, how we get ready

1717
01:15:52,637 --> 01:15:55,659
for how to show up for life internally.

1718
01:15:55,659 --> 01:15:55,661
Karl: Right?

1719
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:57,686
Rafael: So no wonder that it has that

1720
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:58,691
impact.

1721
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:02,677
Like myself, I've dealt with anxiety and

1722
01:16:02,677 --> 01:16:05,702
a lot of other things.

1723
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:07,723
We've had conversations about what are we

1724
01:16:07,723 --> 01:16:09,741
doing bringing a daughter into this world

1725
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:10,756
and all these kinds of things.

1726
01:16:10,756 --> 01:16:13,787
And I think it's only natural that it's

1727
01:16:13,787 --> 01:16:16,817
coming to a head in this way right now.

1728
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:21,867
Curt: Naom you have your hand up and I

1729
01:16:21,867 --> 01:16:22,879
can't see yes.

1730
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,918
Guillaume: Yeah, it's connect with what

1731
01:16:26,918 --> 01:16:29,943
has just been so and your initial

1732
01:16:29,943 --> 01:16:32,972
question about the gaps that needs to be

1733
01:16:32,972 --> 01:16:35,001
closed, I think like a scale free model

1734
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:38,030
of health and mental health particularly

1735
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,045
would be great.

1736
01:16:40,057 --> 01:16:44,092
We are in silos, in biomedical research

1737
01:16:44,092 --> 01:16:47,124
and the fact that someone is having

1738
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:50,156
depression can come from interacting

1739
01:16:50,156 --> 01:16:54,191
genes as much as interacting people and

1740
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:57,226
also is related to climate change and so

1741
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:58,234
on.

1742
01:16:58,234 --> 01:17:01,207
So how we can have a new health systems

1743
01:17:01,207 --> 01:17:04,237
that doesn't deal with those silos and

1744
01:17:04,237 --> 01:17:07,269
integrate those different scales, to me

1745
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:11,300
it's like really a big challenge, but a

1746
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,331
challenge that current models and work

1747
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:17,365
that we can see going that direction.

1748
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,379
And I'm very enthusiastic.

1749
01:17:18,379 --> 01:17:19,387
Bert: About that?

1750
01:17:22,412 --> 01:17:23,421
Curt: Bert.

1751
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,477
Bert: Yeah.

1752
01:17:31,505 --> 01:17:34,531
In my field in engineering, active

1753
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:36,558
inference is not understood because

1754
01:17:36,558 --> 01:17:39,583
almost all papers are written by

1755
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:42,615
neuroscientists and they're hard to read.

1756
01:17:42,615 --> 01:17:42,617
.

1757
01:17:42,619 --> 01:17:46,658
So I was really happy to hear today that.

1758
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:46,658
.

1759
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:49,686
And I think it's Sanjeev Namjoshi who is

1760
01:17:49,686 --> 01:17:52,711
writing an engineering book on active

1761
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:53,719
inference.

1762
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:55,744
So I think that will really help.

1763
01:17:56,754 --> 01:17:59,785
That, together with the availability of

1764
01:17:59,785 --> 01:18:02,756
good toolboxes for implementing active

1765
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:05,789
inference, should make a lot of engineers

1766
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:08,817
much more enthusiastic about active

1767
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,849
inference because it's not something that

1768
01:18:11,849 --> 01:18:14,876
is not understood at the moment in

1769
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:16,897
engineering circles.

1770
01:18:16,898 --> 01:18:20,930
So I hope that the book will be good.

1771
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:22,956
I'm enthusiastic about that.

1772
01:18:24,975 --> 01:18:28,001
Curt: And Karl, where are some gaps in

1773
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:32,005
your research that you'd like to see?

1774
01:18:36,009 --> 01:18:37,010
Karl: More than gaps?

1775
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:41,014
There's a whole empty space out there yet

1776
01:18:41,014 --> 01:18:42,015
to be explored.

1777
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:47,020
But in terms of what seems to be emerging

1778
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:51,024
from the session and specifically the

1779
01:18:51,024 --> 01:18:54,027
past few answers, it does seem to be

1780
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:59,032
important to have this very generic just

1781
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:03,030
to take Bert's sort of line that this is

1782
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:07,034
just one deflationary simple and probably

1783
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:11,038
the right way to understand stuff and to

1784
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:15,042
make recommendations or to describe

1785
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:19,046
people's actions, possibly to themselves

1786
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:22,049
in a therapeutic context.

1787
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,052
And as such, it should be push button

1788
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:28,055
technology and it should be democratized

1789
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,056
and socialized.

1790
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:32,059
And I think that's the challenge,

1791
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,060
practically.

1792
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,063
And 1 may ask, why would you want to do

1793
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,064
that?

1794
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:42,069
For me, there are two clear imperatives.

1795
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:46,073
One is very abstract, and it's not really

1796
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:49,076
within my comfort zone, and the other one

1797
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,078
is in my comfort zone.

1798
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:55,082
But the one that's outside my comfort

1799
01:19:55,082 --> 01:20:00,081
zone is this notion of interactivity and

1800
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:04,085
hyperconnectivity and the metacrisis that

1801
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:06,087
we heard about.

1802
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:10,091
And Aguim also referred to this in terms

1803
01:20:10,091 --> 01:20:13,094
of what he was trying to distinguish

1804
01:20:13,094 --> 01:20:15,096
between a Californian notion of

1805
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:18,099
optimality and another kind, another way

1806
01:20:18,099 --> 01:20:19,100
forward.

1807
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:24,105
And to me, it's a stark contrast with

1808
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:28,109
growth is good versus sustainability.

1809
01:20:28,109 --> 01:20:30,111
And of course, the math of the free

1810
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:32,113
energy principle is just about

1811
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:33,114
sustainability.

1812
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:36,117
It's just a description of the physics of

1813
01:20:36,117 --> 01:20:38,119
systems, random, dynamical systems that

1814
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:41,122
self organize to some non equilibrium

1815
01:20:41,122 --> 01:20:42,123
steady state.

1816
01:20:42,123 --> 01:20:44,125
That is what we are.

1817
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,128
So for me, there's something deeply, if

1818
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:49,130
you like, apt about the free energy

1819
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:52,133
principle and its chronologies, such as

1820
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,135
active inference in application to

1821
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:57,138
ecosystems and lived ecosystems and

1822
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:59,140
realized ecosystems.

1823
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:02,137
So if those basic principles can be

1824
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:06,141
brought back into globalization, into the

1825
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:10,145
market, into fintech, into social media,

1826
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:14,149
into politics, into climate action, I

1827
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:17,152
think that would be a good thing.

1828
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:20,155
I'm just mindful this struck me in a

1829
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:22,157
number of the presentations today.

1830
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:25,160
You remember before, Bert was saying, if

1831
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,163
you look at the brain, which is a really

1832
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:30,165
lovely example of a self organizing

1833
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:32,167
system to a non equilibrium steady state,

1834
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:34,169
then it's empty.

1835
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:35,170
And what did he mean by that?

1836
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,172
What he didn't mean you were empty headed.

1837
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:37,172
.

1838
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:39,174
What he meant was it's incredibly

1839
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:41,176
sparsely connected.

1840
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:44,179
Now, that tells you immediately that a

1841
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:47,182
pathology of connectivity is

1842
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:50,185
hyperconnectivity overconnectivity, which

1843
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:53,188
immediately, well, it made me very alert

1844
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:57,192
to the presentation of the metacrisis.

1845
01:21:57,192 --> 01:22:00,189
That one of the first three things that

1846
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:02,191
was underwrote the metacrisis or the

1847
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:05,194
current crisis we're tending with is a

1848
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:08,197
destruction of that sparse, delicate

1849
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:11,200
connectivity that defines thingness and

1850
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,203
defines ensembles of things technically

1851
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:16,205
in terms of Markov blankets.

1852
01:22:16,205 --> 01:22:19,208
So if we want a world in which lots of

1853
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:21,210
different things can coexist in some kind

1854
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,213
of generalized synchrony in a sustainable

1855
01:22:24,213 --> 01:22:26,215
way, you need fast connectivity.

1856
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:29,218
And the pathology, the thing that will

1857
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:31,220
destroy that, is overconnectivity.

1858
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:35,224
So it seems to be very important that we

1859
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:38,227
get that into play in terms of machine

1860
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:41,230
learning, artificial intelligence,

1861
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:44,233
politics, fintech, climate change.

1862
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:46,235
And the only way it's going to get there

1863
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:48,237
is epistemically by equipping people to

1864
01:22:48,237 --> 01:22:50,239
actually build their own little models

1865
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,241
and ask their own questions.

1866
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:54,243
You can't tell people this they've got to

1867
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:55,244
learn they've got to learn it for

1868
01:22:55,244 --> 01:22:56,245
themselves.

1869
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:58,247
Just very quickly, I'm sure we've only

1870
01:22:58,247 --> 01:23:00,243
got a couple of minutes left.

1871
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:07,250
The other agenda, which I'm more familiar

1872
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:10,253
with is exactly Anna's and Guillaume's

1873
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:13,256
agenda, which is making this work in the

1874
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:17,260
context of neurology and psychiatry.

1875
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:20,263
So if you can democratize and socialize

1876
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:23,266
this way of describing things so that

1877
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:25,268
people can now build models of their

1878
01:23:25,268 --> 01:23:28,271
particular patient in the other use of

1879
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:31,274
precision psychiatry, I suspect that

1880
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:34,276
Guillum's unit was called after.

1881
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:37,280
So it's a personalized medicine that is

1882
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,282
really personalized in the sense that you

1883
01:23:39,282 --> 01:23:42,285
actually have your digital twin of your

1884
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:43,286
behavior.

1885
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:45,288
And then you've got that.

1886
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:48,291
You optimize your digital twin to become

1887
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:51,293
a model of your patient, and then you can

1888
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,296
start to do experiments on that model,

1889
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:56,299
behavioral interventions, or even share

1890
01:23:56,299 --> 01:23:59,301
that model very much in the spirit of CBT

1891
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:01,298
with the patient and say, look, this is

1892
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:02,299
you.

1893
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:03,300
This is what would happen if you went out

1894
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,301
and did this.

1895
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:06,303
And this is what would happen if you went

1896
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:06,303
out and did that.

1897
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:09,306
To my mind.

1898
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:12,309
And indeed, that was the initial

1899
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:15,312
motivation for much of this work, was

1900
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:18,315
actually to build observation models of

1901
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:21,318
psychiatric conditions, to work out both

1902
01:24:21,318 --> 01:24:24,321
the pharmacological and physiological

1903
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:27,324
basis and the disruption of the pathology

1904
01:24:27,324 --> 01:24:30,327
of precision and message.

1905
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:32,329
Passing on the factographs that are our

1906
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:35,332
brain even though they are very empty on

1907
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:38,334
the one hand, but also get that behavior,

1908
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:40,337
that key thing that Anna was talking

1909
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:42,339
about the active engagement with the

1910
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:44,341
lived world into that model and hence

1911
01:24:44,341 --> 01:24:46,343
active inference.

1912
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:49,346
And just to conclude that that activity,

1913
01:24:49,346 --> 01:24:52,349
that sort of physical engagement, that

1914
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:55,352
embodiment, that sort of for ease and

1915
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:58,355
everything else, I think it's really

1916
01:24:58,355 --> 01:25:01,352
coming to a head now in terms of people

1917
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:04,355
after, the large language model, after

1918
01:25:04,355 --> 01:25:07,358
the Chat GPT moment, the bounce back has

1919
01:25:07,358 --> 01:25:09,360
been what's missing?

1920
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:11,362
What's not there?

1921
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:13,364
And of course, what is not there is

1922
01:25:13,364 --> 01:25:15,366
agency and embodied engagement with the

1923
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:16,367
world.

1924
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:19,370
And that's why I think there's still a

1925
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:22,373
lot of work to be done in bringing

1926
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:25,376
artificial intelligence read as active

1927
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,379
inference in a way that matters to people

1928
01:25:28,379 --> 01:25:31,382
who people who can make a difference,

1929
01:25:31,382 --> 01:25:33,384
which is basically everybody, but

1930
01:25:33,384 --> 01:25:36,387
specifically politicians and doctors and

1931
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:39,390
engineers and the like.

1932
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:43,394
Curt: So you all now have 30 seconds to

1933
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:45,396
60 seconds to speak directly to the

1934
01:25:45,396 --> 01:25:46,397
audience.

1935
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:49,400
What is the message that you what closing

1936
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,401
message do you have?

1937
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:52,403
You're speaking directly to someone who's

1938
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:53,404
listening.

1939
01:25:53,404 --> 01:25:54,405
They're a curious person.

1940
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:56,407
They're interested in active inference.

1941
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:59,410
They also want to lead better lives,

1942
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:02,407
hopefully, and do something propitious.

1943
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:05,410
So what message do you have for them?

1944
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,413
Anna, we'll start with you.

1945
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,417
Anna: Gosh.

1946
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,420
I'm just going to say what pops into my

1947
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,423
mind right now is that one of the things

1948
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,426
I have learned from my patients who are

1949
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:24,429
trying to get into recovery from severe

1950
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,431
addictions is something that they call

1951
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:29,434
the set aside prayer where they set aside

1952
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:32,437
all of the notions that they have about

1953
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,439
how the world works and try to be

1954
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,442
completely open and receptive to

1955
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,445
information coming into their minds.

1956
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,448
And I think that's just a wonderful frame

1957
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,451
or concept for all of us living in the

1958
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,454
world to periodically just take a moment

1959
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:52,457
and take these models and just say

1960
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,460
everything I think I know about the world,

1961
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,463
, I'm going to temporarily suspend it,

1962
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:01,460
and I'm just going to be open.

1963
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,462
And when that happens, we can be present

1964
01:27:03,462 --> 01:27:05,464
and learn in a way that it's not possible

1965
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:07,466
when we're just trying to reinforce our

1966
01:27:07,466 --> 01:27:08,467
models.

1967
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:09,468
Curt: Great.

1968
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
Fantastic.

1969
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:11,470
And Bert.

1970
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:12,471
And then we'll go.

1971
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:12,471
Karl.

1972
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:15,474
And then Raph and then Guillaume.

1973
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:19,478
Bert: Well, I just enjoyed today very

1974
01:27:19,478 --> 01:27:19,478
much.

1975
01:27:19,478 --> 01:27:22,481
I thought there was a lot of material,

1976
01:27:22,481 --> 01:27:25,484
both for people from, let's say,

1977
01:27:25,484 --> 01:27:28,487
psychology, neuroscience, but also for

1978
01:27:28,487 --> 01:27:29,488
engineers.

1979
01:27:29,488 --> 01:27:31,490
So if you haven't watched some of the

1980
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,492
talks, go look through the schedule,

1981
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:35,494
because some of the talks were really

1982
01:27:35,494 --> 01:27:36,495
good, I think.

1983
01:27:36,495 --> 01:27:37,496
So I really enjoyed that.

1984
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:40,499
And then, yeah, what should I tell

1985
01:27:40,499 --> 01:27:41,499
people?

1986
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,501
Go work out.

1987
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:43,502
Do a lot of sports.

1988
01:27:43,502 --> 01:27:44,503
It's good for you.

1989
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:50,509
Karl: Yeah.

1990
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:52,511
Sorry, I was going to make a joke, but I

1991
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:53,512
can't because it wouldn't be.

1992
01:27:55,514 --> 01:27:59,518
So I'm going to use my 30 seconds just to

1993
01:27:59,518 --> 01:28:03,516
thank Daniel and his team for this.

1994
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:07,520
If you want something to do, you should

1995
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,524
go and watch the live streams and get

1996
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:14,527
involved with this ecosystem.

1997
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:17,530
I hadn't seen that paper being presented

1998
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:20,533
before, but I was really impressed with

1999
01:28:20,533 --> 01:28:23,536
the Active Institute and its openness and

2000
01:28:23,536 --> 01:28:26,539
its welcoming attitude and vision, like

2001
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:28,541
the Smithsonian.

2002
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:32,545
So if you want to pursue these ideas, get

2003
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:32,545
involved.

2004
01:28:33,546 --> 01:28:35,548
And if you haven't got time, just make

2005
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:37,550
sure you attend next year's Active

2006
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:40,553
Inference Institute celebration.

2007
01:28:40,553 --> 01:28:41,554
But thank you, Daniel.

2008
01:28:42,555 --> 01:28:45,557
Curt: Rafael yeah.

2009
01:28:45,558 --> 01:28:48,561
Rafael: So I'll second what Karl said and

2010
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:50,563
follow on with it's.

2011
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:53,566
An invitation not just to participate in

2012
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:56,569
the Active Defense Institute, but also

2013
01:28:56,569 --> 01:28:59,572
the invitation to participate in building

2014
01:28:59,572 --> 01:29:02,569
this Gaia tractor, this new way of doing

2015
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:05,572
things that acknowledges the value of

2016
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:07,574
growth, and also the value of

2017
01:29:07,574 --> 01:29:10,577
sustainability, joins it all together in

2018
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:13,580
this thing called regeneration.

2019
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:18,585
And it really is a collective effort.

2020
01:29:18,585 --> 01:29:19,586
It's a collective learning effort.

2021
01:29:22,588 --> 01:29:24,591
And this also, by the way, also applies

2022
01:29:24,591 --> 01:29:26,593
to the panelists as well.

2023
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:27,594
I think.

2024
01:29:27,594 --> 01:29:30,597
Obviously, what Bert and Karl are doing,

2025
01:29:30,597 --> 01:29:34,601
it has immediate things that have to do

2026
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:36,603
with what we're after.

2027
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:39,606
But one of the main things that we keep

2028
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:42,609
discussing is also like this the inter

2029
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:45,612
subjectivity and the importance of being

2030
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:48,615
able to operate well as humans together.

2031
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:50,617
And that connects directly to cognitive

2032
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:51,618
science in psychiatry.

2033
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:55,622
And so everybody that wants to be engaged

2034
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:59,626
and be a part of building a better world

2035
01:29:59,626 --> 01:30:03,624
should be thinking about what am I doing

2036
01:30:03,624 --> 01:30:06,627
as an individual or as employee of

2037
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:10,631
organization or as a researcher or as a

2038
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:14,635
leader or as a family member, what am I

2039
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:15,636
doing?

2040
01:30:15,636 --> 01:30:19,640
How does it contribute to this new non

2041
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,643
equilibrium set of state?

2042
01:30:22,643 --> 01:30:24,645
So, yeah, that's kind of it.

2043
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:26,647
I probably blew through the 60 seconds,

2044
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:27,648
but here it is.

2045
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:28,649
Curt: And Guillaume,

2046
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:31,652
Guillaume: Well, I would thanks also, all

2047
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:34,654
of you for the discussion and the

2048
01:30:34,654 --> 01:30:36,657
organizer for what they are doing.

2049
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:39,660
Indeed, the work of the Active Inference

2050
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:42,662
Institute is very laudable and

2051
01:30:42,662 --> 01:30:44,665
interesting from an open science

2052
01:30:44,665 --> 01:30:45,666
perspective.

2053
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:46,667
They are really embodying

2054
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:50,670
that. So big kudos to them.

2055
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:53,674
And well, the Frieze was saying to do

2056
01:30:53,674 --> 01:30:55,676
sport is good for you.

2057
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:57,678
I'm not very good at sports, but some say

2058
01:30:57,678 --> 01:30:59,680
that science is a team sport.

2059
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:04,679
So at least have a good team perspective

2060
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:06,681
when doing science.

2061
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:08,683
And being kind to each other would be the

2062
01:31:08,683 --> 01:31:10,685
best advice to everyone.

2063
01:31:12,687 --> 01:31:14,689
Curt: Well, thank you.

2064
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:16,691
Daniel: You get yours too.

2065
01:31:16,691 --> 01:31:18,693
Somebody else has to come in from outside

2066
01:31:18,693 --> 01:31:20,695
the Markov blanket, though.

2067
01:31:21,696 --> 01:31:23,698
Curt: Well, I wanted to just thank you,

2068
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:24,699
Daniel.

2069
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:25,700
Thank you, Daniel.

2070
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:28,703
And Rafael and also Karl and Anna and

2071
01:31:28,703 --> 01:31:30,705
Bert and Guillaume.

2072
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:32,707
This was tremendous amount of fun.

2073
01:31:32,707 --> 01:31:35,710
And well, I hope I get to speak to you

2074
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:36,711
all individually.

2075
01:31:36,711 --> 01:31:39,714
And as usual, I have way more questions

2076
01:31:39,714 --> 01:31:42,717
than we were able to get to.

2077
01:31:42,717 --> 01:31:44,719
Thank you all.

2078
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:44,719
Rafael: Thanks.

2079
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:46,721
Thank you.

2080
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:47,722
Daniel: Thanks everyone.

2081
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:50,725
Farewell to the panelists.

2082
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
Karl: You're all.

2083
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:52,727
Daniel: Welcome back anytime.

2084
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:55,730
Thanks everybody, for watching.

2085
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:56,731
Be watching.

2086
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:59,734
Right now we're about to head over to the

2087
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:01,730
discord and hang out and talk a little

2088
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,732
more if you want to, and then stay

2089
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:05,734
involved, get involved.

2090
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:07,736
So till next time.

2091
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:08,737
Curt: Bye.
