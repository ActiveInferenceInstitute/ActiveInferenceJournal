1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,396
And it's a great segue from collective

2
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,656
behavior in surprise minimizing agents

3
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:17,276
to collective behavior in surprise

4
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,352
minimizing agents, I guess. Welcome,

5
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:23,136
Connor. Hey. Sorry, I just turned on my

6
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:25,344
audio, so I just heard the last thing

7
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:28,880
you said. Yeah. Hey, welcome. Yes,

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,296
thanks. Um, we're looking forward to

9
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:34,916
your presentation. Multi agent active

10
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:36,676
inference and multiscale alignment,

11
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:39,192
current developments and challenges. So

12
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:41,496
feel free to share your screen or

13
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,472
proceed however you prefer. Great,

14
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:47,016
thanks. And before I start, because I've

15
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,104
had issues with my voice saturating,

16
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:51,756
like my microphone saturating, how's my

17
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:53,356
audio? Is it clipping at all? Or does

18
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,696
this sound okay? This is good and I'm

19
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,850
watching it. Okay, perfect. Thank you.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,690
I will share my screen.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,556
Share this one. The one thing I'll note

22
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:11,552
oh, yes. OK. It's just JF symbolic

23
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,064
implementation does not use statistical

24
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:19,264
distributions. It uses the symbolic

25
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,268
and the logical inference. And now we're

26
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,464
going to move back into the

27
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:25,816
distributional space, and it will be

28
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:27,256
awesome to see similarities and

29
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,896
differences. So thank you, Connor, to

30
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,480
you for the presentation.

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,984
And thank you, Daniel, for the

32
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:37,036
introduction and for inviting me, as

33
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,572
well as big thank you to the other

34
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,456
organizers of the Third Applied Active

35
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:43,276
Influence Symposium. Yeah, I'm really

36
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:46,236
happy to be here to present. So. My name

37
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,556
is Connor Hines. I'm a PhD student at

38
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,156
the Max Planck Institute of Animal

39
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:52,912
Behavior. And I'm also a researcher at

40
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,872
the Versus AI research lab.

41
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:59,456
R D lab. So I'm going to do something a

42
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:01,570
little bit, I guess, unconventional for

43
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,828
people in my position. Like, I'm a

44
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,428
junior researcher coming to the end of

45
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:08,004
my PhD. So usually when I give a talk,

46
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:10,390
I would present on my own research,

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,980
like what I've been up to for the last

48
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,496
ten years working on. But instead of

49
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,010
that, I'm actually going to talk about

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,324
given the motivation of the symposium,

51
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:21,556
I'm going to talk about something that's

52
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:24,356
more of an overview or perspective on

53
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:26,572
the current state of the field in

54
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,728
multiscale active inference or multi

55
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:31,452
agent active inference and what, in my

56
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:33,932
opinion, we need to do to move forward

57
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:37,612
as a field. I think that's very resonant

58
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,456
with the kind of motivations and the

59
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:42,508
title, indeed, of this symposium. So I'm

60
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,304
going to give a general analysis of what

61
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:47,004
multiscale active inference is, why it's

62
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,376
important. I'm going to provide a brief

63
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:51,428
analysis of its formal basis as it

64
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,556
currently stands, and then what we need

65
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:56,304
to develop in this kind of subdiscipline

66
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,656
of active inference, multiscale active

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,756
inference, to really make it rigorous

68
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,792
and really to actually reap the benefits

69
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,760
of what it promises.

70
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,856
So generally, active inference has been

71
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,136
used a lot to design agents that can

72
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,752
solve problems, plan, and just generally

73
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,200
emulate behavior that we deem

74
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,396
intelligent, which includes things like

75
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,524
risk sensitive decision making,

76
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:24,696
intrinsic motivations to resolve

77
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,944
uncertainty, and finally, from a more

78
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:29,024
scientific standpoint, the ability to

79
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:31,440
furnish a process theory about how

80
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,050
biological brains actually might work.

81
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,536
But in a lot of the theoretical work on

82
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:40,150
active inference from the last ten years

83
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,844
or ten plus years, really, there's also

84
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,760
alongside all the kind of practical

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,508
building adaptive agents, there's a

86
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:48,836
claim that active inference is

87
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:51,460
inherently or intrinsically multiscale

88
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,588
from the very get go. It is a multiscale

89
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,600
framework. It's not just about building

90
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,924
single agents. So it's really whenever

91
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,196
we write down a single active inference

92
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,056
agent, what we're implicitly implying is

93
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,976
also a nested hierarchy of active

94
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,192
inference agents both below and above.

95
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,196
So colloquially, you'll often see this

96
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,616
in papers as the idea that there's

97
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,496
Markov blankets all the way down Markov

98
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:17,428
blanket is a statistical structure

99
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,416
that's very kind of intrinsic to the

100
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:22,972
definition of agents as they are defined

101
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:24,528
under active inference. So I'm not going

102
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,864
to get into defining that. I'm kind of

103
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:27,904
assuming that there's a more

104
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,948
disciplinarian audience there, but I'm

105
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,696
sure other talks, for instance, can

106
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,076
provide better clarity. So yeah, Markov

107
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,084
blanket's active inference all the way

108
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,788
down, all the way up. And at any given

109
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,152
scale, crucially, the free energy

110
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:43,076
minimizing dynamics, or the active

111
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,268
inference dynamics are kind of claimed

112
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:48,184
to be aligned with or parallel to the

113
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,488
free energy minimizing gradients at the

114
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:54,068
level below and above. So the claim is

115
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,124
that as agents are doing their thing and

116
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,476
doing active inference at one level, it

117
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,116
both entails and is constrained by

118
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,592
active inference processes of the macro

119
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:06,124
agent that they're participating in. So

120
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:09,004
I'm a cell that's part of a tissue as

121
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,084
well as the micro agents that comprise

122
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:13,484
them. I am a free energy minimizing

123
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,836
cellular agent comprised of organelles

124
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,650
that are also minimizing free energy.

125
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,432
So this kind of constrained neat

126
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,108
nested gradient descent on free energy

127
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,056
is part of the story of multiscale

128
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,072
active inference. And it also crucially,

129
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:31,184
assumes that these dynamics are aligned,

130
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,224
correlated cooperative across these

131
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:35,592
different scales. So I should mention

132
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:38,232
that there is a formal argument made

133
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:39,912
more recently, I would say in the last

134
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,484
five years, about how this is possible.

135
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,860
And it relies on an apparatus from

136
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,364
statistical physics called the

137
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,572
Renormalization group. This basically

138
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,760
allows you to analytically identify

139
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,164
shared symmetries energy and

140
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,856
conservation laws at different scales in

141
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,224
a given system that's comprised of

142
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:01,088
subsystems and subsystems, so on

143
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:04,124
infinitum. So there's a formal argument

144
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,232
specifically made in a free energy

145
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:08,816
principle for a particular physics

146
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,476
monograph in 2019 that applies the

147
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,716
renormalization group apparatus to

148
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:16,544
multivariate stochastic differential

149
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,116
equations that are kind of the

150
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:21,704
equivalent of agents. So you can apply

151
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,600
that framework to certain sorts of

152
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,484
coupled stochastic differential

153
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,204
equations that exhibit Markov blanketed

154
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:31,256
sparse coupling structure. And you can

155
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,496
kind of prove analytically that there

156
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,276
are going to be nested systems of Markov

157
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:38,056
blankets and that they're all in some

158
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,316
sense minimizing three energies at their

159
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,236
own scales. So I'll get more into that

160
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:44,092
argument later, but I just want to

161
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:46,236
mention that as I define multiscale

162
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:49,036
active inference that there is a formal

163
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:52,912
argument that's related to it. So this

164
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,988
slide I just put together to demonstrate

165
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:56,720
the idea of nested free energy

166
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,848
minimizing processes visually. So at a

167
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,884
given scale, we can think of an agent as

168
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,060
occupying some point in its free energy

169
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,100
landscape indicated by this red orb,

170
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,292
which represents, say, its

171
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,084
configuration, its beliefs, and its

172
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,416
actions. And it performs active

173
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,824
inference and in doing so minimizes its

174
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:16,632
free energy. So it changes the position

175
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,856
of that ball on that landscape. And that

176
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,308
is all we mean when we say active

177
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:22,952
inference. That corresponds to the agent

178
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:25,396
doing inference and doing action and

179
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,436
kind of getting to the fixed point of

180
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,996
its local free energy landscape. The

181
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,252
multi agent case is simply when we add

182
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,976
more of these processes. So there's

183
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:36,652
other agents usually assumed to be

184
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,084
similar agents, and the word similarity,

185
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:41,136
let's put an asterisk on that. And

186
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:42,544
they're all sitting at different points

187
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,880
in their own free energy landscapes.

188
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,916
The position of their local red ball is

189
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,616
maybe in a different place. So the claim

190
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:54,084
of multiscale active inference is that

191
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:56,208
as we link these multiple active

192
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,116
inference agents together, so they can

193
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,892
actually exchange information like

194
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,816
observations and actions with each

195
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:04,664
other, what we automatically get is some

196
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:06,792
kind of superagent that is also

197
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:09,384
minimizing variation of free energy and

198
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,384
is in some sense an emergent or

199
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:14,232
Supervenient active inference agent.

200
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,924
And I say the word, we automatically get

201
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:19,516
a superagent with an asterisk because

202
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,436
there may be some conditions on that

203
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,964
mapping from local to global that have

204
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,368
to be elucidated. So we'll come back to

205
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,744
that in a bit. But in short, I think the

206
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,228
definition of multiscale active

207
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,264
inference is very eloquently put in this

208
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,620
paper by Rafael Kaufman,

209
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,088
Pranav Gupta, and Jacob Taylor. I think

210
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,076
Rafael Kaufman is actually going to be

211
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:44,644
on the panel later. And this line from

212
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:46,964
their paper is a really nice, I think,

213
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:49,476
just summary of what it is. So I'll just

214
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,876
read it out loud. The upshot is that in

215
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,796
theory, any active inference agent at

216
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:55,976
one Spaciotemporal scale could be

217
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:58,116
simultaneously composed of nested active

218
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,840
inference agents at the scale below and

219
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,916
constituent of a larger active inference

220
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:05,252
agent at the scale above it. In effect,

221
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:07,356
active inference allows you to pick a

222
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:09,196
composite system or agent A that you

223
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:11,164
want to understand. And it will be

224
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:14,396
generally true that both that agent A is

225
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:16,784
an approximate global minimizer of free

226
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,360
energy at the scale at which that agent

227
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,864
reliably persists, and that agent A is

228
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:26,736
composed of subsystems A, sub I that

229
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:28,676
are approximate local minimizers with

230
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,056
free energy. So that is the claim as I'm

231
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,880
going to continue evaluating

232
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,516
in this talk, and I think it's just a

233
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,790
great reference point to make,

234
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,528
okay, that's what multiscale active

235
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:44,856
inference is. Why is it important? Why

236
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,440
do we actually care about that? That

237
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,264
sounds philosophically nice and

238
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:49,944
beautiful visually, but why is that

239
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:51,912
important? So there's a ton of actually

240
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,656
really important implications of this,

241
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,416
both for the engineering and the natural

242
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:57,708
sciences. First of all, the namesake of

243
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,156
this symposium, I assume inspired by

244
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,620
this recent paper by Karl Frison and all

245
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,470
about enacting ecosystems of

246
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,784
parenthetically shared intelligence. So

247
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,396
this is the third applied active

248
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:13,136
inference symposium. So to really make

249
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,988
this resonate with the applied aspect,

250
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,580
let's make this very concrete. If we can

251
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,792
figure out this multiscale endeavor,

252
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,392
then we can actually engineer

253
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,456
distributed systems of multiaging

254
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,556
intelligence where local agents, in

255
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:27,456
doing their own little local active

256
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,300
inference processes, are also

257
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,764
cooperatively instantiating a global

258
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:34,036
agent that's also performing active

259
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,340
inference. This has huge computational

260
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,696
potential, of course, compared to kind

261
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:40,644
of the state of the art predominant

262
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:43,508
methods for artificial intelligence,

263
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,836
which are deep learning, which really is

264
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,820
about propagating global information

265
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,524
through an entire computation graph. So

266
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,044
although you could argue back

267
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:53,836
propagation is local in some sense,

268
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,724
it's really not local in the way that

269
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,656
multiscale active inference progresses

270
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,776
to be local. So if we can figure out how

271
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:01,868
to actually engineer multiscale active

272
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:03,600
inference, it will have really

273
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,696
tremendous implications for the study of

274
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:07,644
artificial intelligence just from that

275
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:10,276
pure engineering standpoint. It'll be

276
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,068
cheaper. In one word, it'll be

277
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,856
computationally energetically, memory

278
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,940
wise. Cheaper. A lot cheaper.

279
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,504
Secondly, from a kind of more natural

280
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,108
sciences motivation, which is kind of

281
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,764
where I'm coming from, I'm doing a PhD

282
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,480
in biology, so I'm interested in

283
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,656
questions about actual real systems in

284
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:30,056
nature. Just the idea of being able to

285
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,104
get super specific and rigorous about

286
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:34,344
phrases like emergent intelligence,

287
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:36,424
emergent computation, collective

288
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,972
intelligence, superorganism that's often

289
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:40,188
thrown around. We're talking about

290
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:42,332
social insects, right? These are terms

291
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,204
that you hear thrown around in many

292
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:45,776
different scientific disciplines that

293
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:48,940
deal with multi agent systems, network

294
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,904
systems. But none of these terms, to my

295
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,584
knowledge, have really rigorous or

296
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:55,916
precise conditions. Multiscale active

297
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,416
inference is a kind of framework that's

298
00:11:58,448 --> 00:11:59,876
in the position to provide those

299
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:02,004
rigorous definitions and conditions. So

300
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,260
from a scientific standpoint, it could

301
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,764
really lend a lot of potential and

302
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,472
usefulness for other scientific

303
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,432
disciplines. And finally, another

304
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:13,688
pragmatic motivation. There's loads of

305
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:15,876
fields that are obsessed with designing

306
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:18,088
and engineering systems where local,

307
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:21,512
selfish individual behavior can

308
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,344
lead when networked appropriately to

309
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,264
some desired collective outcome. And

310
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:27,836
these disciplines really want to figure

311
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,756
out how to engineer that properly. So

312
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,352
this goes from the design of financial

313
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,516
markets and trading systems all the way

314
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:36,108
down to how do you design a multiplayer

315
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:39,856
video game? So that's kind of just

316
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,756
motivating. Why is multiscale active

317
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:44,176
inference even interesting? So then the

318
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,048
question, of course, becomes, is the

319
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,624
multiscale active inference claim

320
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,276
actually true? Are all multi agent

321
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,564
active inference systems comprised of

322
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:55,136
and themselves comprise nested hierarchy

323
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:57,636
of free energy minimization agents? A

324
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:59,204
glance at a smattering of other

325
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,124
scientific disciplines that specifically

326
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,524
deal with multiple agents, multiple

327
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,992
interests, collective phenomena like

328
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,620
coordination, group behavior,

329
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,136
collective intelligence. A glance at all

330
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:11,716
those disciplines would naively suggest

331
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,804
that the answer is no. So there's things

332
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:16,424
like frustration in thermodynamic

333
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:19,304
systems game theory, the very existence

334
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:21,752
of zero sum games and mass equilibria

335
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,772
bandwagon effects when we're talking

336
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:26,276
about social networks and opinion

337
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:29,360
dynamics. Sacrifices for the common

338
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,756
good, which we see in different contexts

339
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,724
in biology, like in the context of kin

340
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,568
selection, but also in the context of

341
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:38,480
arguably cell death in a tissue.

342
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,524
These are all basically plenty of

343
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:43,204
systems where local constraints and

344
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:45,444
global constraints or desires or free

345
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,868
energy gradients, whatever you want to

346
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,752
call them, come into direct conflict.

347
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,688
So the obvious example that I listed at

348
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,736
the top of these bullets is the idea of

349
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:56,264
geometric frustration that we see in

350
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,356
Icing systems with very low temperature.

351
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:01,172
So these Icing models basically describe

352
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:03,832
lattices of Ferromagnets that are happy

353
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,224
when they're pointing in the same

354
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,528
direction as their neighboring

355
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:08,476
Ferromagnets and they can be in an up or

356
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:11,448
a down state. So basically the magnet

357
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,068
can be pointing up or pointing down.

358
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,036
And these global systems are defined by

359
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:17,004
a global energy function and the whole

360
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,816
system is in some sense trying to

361
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,880
minimize that global energy function.

362
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,184
But sometimes you'll find cases in these

363
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:24,624
collective systems where this little

364
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,976
spin in the middle cannot be happy

365
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:28,332
because they're getting conflicting

366
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:30,208
information from two neighbors. I want

367
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:33,092
to be pointing up in blue like the agent

368
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:34,996
on the left, but I also want to be

369
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:36,276
pointing down like the agent on the

370
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:38,496
right. So this is a system that's

371
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,836
collectively finding some fixed point of

372
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,896
its global free energy, but it's

373
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:44,676
actually leading to a local conflict

374
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,016
where this agent is not at a point where

375
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:49,272
it can do anything to make itself happy

376
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,464
or minimize its free energy further. So

377
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:54,124
just from even the basic glance at

378
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:56,396
Ferromagnetic lattices, we already see

379
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:58,904
instances where local and global

380
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,796
gradients or local and global optima are

381
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,616
not aligned in the right way. So given

382
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,624
all this, the burden of proof for

383
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:10,464
multiscale active inference is still on

384
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,124
us. So we need to show that collective

385
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:14,768
active inference systems generically do

386
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:18,304
align again across scales. And maybe if

387
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:20,612
we can put an X across the word

388
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,512
generically and it's not some automatic

389
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,204
condition, if they don't, then at least

390
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:26,884
we have to establish exactly the

391
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:30,600
conditions in which they do. So

392
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,064
anecdotally we do actually have some

393
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:36,456
conditions. There seem to be some kind

394
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,316
of basic ingredients to get collective

395
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,784
active inference to work. So one is that

396
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:44,100
we basically need agents to exchange

397
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,268
actions and sensations across some kind

398
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,876
of Markov blanket. This is not really a

399
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,716
condition. This is almost more part of

400
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:53,580
what it means to be an agent. So having

401
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,900
Markov blanket separation between agents

402
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,736
is just another way of saying we have

403
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,424
multiple agents in our system rather

404
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:01,804
than a single agent if you're violating

405
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,156
the Markov blanket property. So internal

406
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,352
states of one agent are not allowed to

407
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:08,636
see the internal states or external

408
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,476
states of another agent. Then you're

409
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,796
kind of cheating because you're kind of

410
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:13,636
saying it's actually one agent. And what

411
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:15,552
you're doing is information sharing

412
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:17,956
within the brain of a single agent. The

413
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,124
second condition, which is something

414
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,612
that's often hallucinated more

415
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,984
anecdotally and not really formally, is

416
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:24,856
this idea that agents need to have some

417
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,916
kind of shared narrative or shared

418
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:29,016
hidden states or censor space in their

419
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:32,632
generative model. So I've worked a lot

420
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,836
on collective active inference systems,

421
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,116
just simulating agents and trying to get

422
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,764
them to do interesting things together.

423
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,924
And my intuitions and experience do

424
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:43,036
agree with this basic fact. If the

425
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,196
agents don't have any similarity in what

426
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:46,764
they're representing or trying to

427
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:48,576
achieve, then it's kind of like trying

428
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:50,604
to fit a square peg into a circular

429
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,492
hole. So this is really nicely

430
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,436
elucidated in one of the earliest cases

431
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,872
in this paper, a Duet for One by first

432
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,848
and Fritz in 2015, where they show that

433
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,676
for two agents to really align, they

434
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,272
kind of have to have a shared generative

435
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:06,164
model and then you can get kind of this

436
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,644
nice synchronized behavior. Again,

437
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:10,404
though, these things like what does

438
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:12,016
similarity mean? What does a shared

439
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,604
narrative actually mean? Formally,

440
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,416
mathematically, those things have not

441
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,528
been initiated yet. So right now, a lot

442
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,396
of the building of these collective

443
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:21,576
systems is based on our intuitions and

444
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:23,784
kind of engineering things using some

445
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,356
vague guidelines like, oh, they should

446
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,624
have a shared sensor space, but there's

447
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,184
no mathematical conditions or guarantees

448
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,076
about what degree of similarity is

449
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:34,412
needed between two agents models to get

450
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,376
the intended dynamics. And finally, we

451
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:39,404
have to have at least some agreement

452
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:42,464
between the generative model of each

453
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:44,336
agent and the generative process, which

454
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,464
is really the behavior of the other

455
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:48,668
agents generating their data. So this is

456
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,836
kind of related to the previous point

457
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:52,736
about having shared generative models.

458
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:55,636
But just to be very specific, the

459
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,484
physics of the space that transfers your

460
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,704
actions to my observations that physics

461
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:02,984
can't be dramatically crazily different

462
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:05,844
than how our generative models represent

463
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:08,308
those physics. So if we took two fish

464
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:10,296
with the same generative model of each

465
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:12,552
other and they normally would school

466
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:14,596
together in a fish tank, but we throw

467
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,796
them in a volcano or shoot them out into

468
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:19,100
outer space they won't. School together.

469
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,764
Because then the generative process is

470
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,036
so dramatically deviating from the way

471
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,388
they are representing that physics, the

472
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:26,636
way their generative model is

473
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,752
constructed. So these are, again just

474
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,304
ingredients, kind of guidelines or

475
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,144
anecdotes. But there's nothing really

476
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:33,836
rigorous behind these conditions.

477
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,232
They're more like a list of best

478
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:38,128
practices. So now let's get on to actual

479
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:40,112
rigorous stuff. So, the first real

480
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,048
rigorous attempt to show that multiscale

481
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:44,564
active inference generally works is in

482
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:46,212
one section of this free energy

483
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,536
principle for a particular physics

484
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:50,188
monograph from 2019. So it leverages

485
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:52,056
this apparatus I mentioned earlier, the

486
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:54,184
Renormalization group operator, to

487
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:56,084
basically show how one can successively

488
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,196
coarse grain multivariate stochastic

489
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:00,756
differential equations that admit sparse

490
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,884
coupling between their state variables.

491
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,004
So the main result in my mind that

492
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,564
connects these renormalization group

493
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,880
results to multiscale active inference

494
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,044
is the fact that the Lagrangian of the

495
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:15,244
system at one scale can be expressed as

496
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:17,104
a function of the Lagrangian at other

497
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:18,844
scales. And that applies in a scale

498
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,656
invariant fashion that is the main kind

499
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,456
of output or the main benefit of using a

500
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:28,416
renormalization group apparatus. So you

501
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:30,016
can kind of think of Lagrangian like the

502
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:32,592
generative model. It's a physics term,

503
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,292
but it's related to the generative model

504
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,260
of the agents that comprise the system

505
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,420
and therefore also their free energy.

506
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,516
So in terms of active inference, it

507
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:41,748
means that this reasoning of the

508
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:43,716
renormalization group can be used to

509
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,576
smoothly move between the models of

510
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:47,816
individual agents at one scale and the

511
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,216
model of a collective or larger agent at

512
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:52,008
a different scale or a smaller scale for

513
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:53,868
that matter. And the nice thing about it

514
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,204
is general for all kinds of dynamics and

515
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,140
thus generative models, it doesn't

516
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,748
depend heavily on the form of the

517
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,476
stochastic differential equations that

518
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:05,740
form your system. The issues

519
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,996
with it is that there's not a global

520
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,428
link to Bayesian mechanics and active

521
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,064
inference. It's still all done in the

522
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,176
traditional physics formalism. So we

523
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,704
don't actually have an explicit link to

524
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:18,684
local inference and global inference.

525
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:19,964
Although if you know the connection

526
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,364
between the Lagrangian and the

527
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,204
generative model and the free energy,

528
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,076
then you can make that connection. But

529
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,364
it's not actually made explicitly for us

530
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:29,444
in this part of the monograph. It also

531
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:30,596
requires the assumption that the

532
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:32,032
generative model and the generative

533
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,376
process are identical at the local level

534
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,296
that's related to how the Lagrangian is

535
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,036
defined. That's also restrictive

536
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,096
assumption. That's probably not

537
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:41,144
realistic in my opinion. And then

538
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:43,656
finally, there's something about kind of

539
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:46,036
spatiotemporal segregation of scales.

540
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:48,252
So we need to make assumptions about how

541
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,396
fast random fluctuations are at one

542
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,604
scale relative to another scale in order

543
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,684
to justify kind of coarse grading or

544
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,088
forgetting about certain states as you

545
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,944
move between scales. And that's also

546
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:01,120
something that you could argue. Current

547
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,680
research into collective dynamics

548
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,784
challenges that assumption about how

549
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:08,988
fast noise is at one scale relative to

550
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,892
the next. So now I'm going to discuss

551
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,716
quickly another small contingent of

552
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,444
active inference research that is

553
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,104
attempted to address this mapping

554
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,784
between local and global inference

555
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:21,076
processes. So what I want to kind of

556
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,276
just generally say with this

557
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,956
presentation and to our community is

558
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,416
that the kind of approach taken in these

559
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:27,156
two papers, first of all, active

560
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,196
inference model of collective

561
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:30,504
intelligence and spin glass systems as

562
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:32,424
collective active inference. This is one

563
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,856
of the types of research I think we

564
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,628
really need to move active inference,

565
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:39,096
multiscale active inference forward. So

566
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:40,316
I'm not trying to be too biased because

567
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:41,996
I am the first author on the second of

568
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:43,596
those papers, but I'll also be the first

569
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:45,612
one to point out the limitation. But

570
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,256
benefits wise, I think these approaches

571
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,512
are really important because they

572
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,992
formally relate a local generative model

573
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,724
at one scale to a global generative

574
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,712
model at a different scale. So really

575
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,696
tie, how do the parameters of one model

576
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:59,876
relate to a course grade model? And

577
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:02,788
these are really good steps in the

578
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:04,436
direction of a formal theory of

579
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,404
collective intelligence that goes from

580
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:08,176
local intelligences to global

581
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,124
intelligence. However, there's still

582
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,032
issues with these. One of them is that

583
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:15,492
they only deal with issue with inference

584
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,236
at the global level, not active

585
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,924
inference. So both these papers concern

586
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,876
with a bunch of local active inference

587
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,864
agents that cooperate to form a global

588
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:26,024
inference agent, like a passive baying

589
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,216
agent, rather than an active inference

590
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,396
agent. And it's also unclear whether the

591
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:32,444
systems studying these papers are

592
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:35,208
actually very generic. Like the results

593
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:36,584
are generic to studying collective

594
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:39,040
intelligence in general, or they're nice

595
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,704
formal arguments, but they're only

596
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,924
applicable to these specific systems.

597
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:44,396
So we still don't have something that's

598
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,864
even more kind of zoomed out and

599
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:49,108
abstract than these, which tend to be a

600
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,716
little bit case specific. And finally,

601
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,676
the actual scale transcendence that

602
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:56,196
we're doing in these papers is still

603
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:58,180
relegated to really one step. We're not

604
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,316
doing the full multiscale infinite

605
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,592
scale regression that something like

606
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:06,744
Renormalization group promises. So

607
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:08,392
that's kind of the current overview of

608
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:09,764
what I think are the most promising

609
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:11,588
directions in multiscale active

610
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:13,976
inference. And I'm aware on time,

611
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:15,356
sorry, five minutes. So I'm going to

612
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,204
quickly try to go through what I think

613
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:21,496
are really promising directions to push

614
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,864
in terms of multiscale active inference

615
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:25,596
and kind of intuition pumps that I think

616
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:28,732
will help us study these systems

617
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:30,512
in a way that's different and also

618
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:32,144
actually better informed by other

619
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:35,072
research disciplines. So the general

620
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:36,976
idea that I'd like to put forward is

621
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,444
that misaligned gradients can actually

622
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:41,044
be a good thing. So it's actually

623
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:43,332
sometimes good when local free energy

624
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:45,936
gradients are misaligned with global

625
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,464
gradients. So sometimes the global

626
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,676
system will actually do better if the

627
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:53,144
local systems are performing worse. So

628
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,264
this is something you could call

629
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,424
multiscale conflict, where the free

630
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,516
energy minimizing processes at one scale

631
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:00,740
are actually doing bad, quote unquote,

632
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,776
but it's because they're being driven by

633
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,652
some higher scale process that is doing

634
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:06,940
well. So rather than trying to always

635
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,228
avoid constructing processes like this,

636
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,916
I think this kind of frustration, to use

637
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:13,816
the analogy from statistical physics,

638
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:16,656
can actually be an inspiration for what

639
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,336
we should investigate further because it

640
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,092
actually might be key to facilitating

641
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:22,160
optimality at different scales.

642
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,304
The reason I put this forward is because

643
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:29,128
there's loads of research, just recent

644
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:30,964
research in the last several years that

645
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,372
are suggesting that actually making

646
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:34,644
local agents more frustrated or more

647
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,284
unhappy might coincidentally or not

648
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,536
coincidentally lead to better collective

649
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:41,808
or global outcomes. So this is expressed

650
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:44,036
in various forms in various bodies of

651
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,668
work. One of the biggest patterns I've

652
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,332
noticed is the study of collective

653
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:49,364
behavioral systems over the last several

654
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:51,624
decades is the idea that local noise and

655
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:54,616
local Dysregulation can often facilitate

656
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:57,224
global coherence or global coordination.

657
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,496
And where multiscale active inference

658
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:01,196
has something to say, in my opinion, is

659
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:03,788
in framing this benefit of local

660
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:05,976
frustration in terms of a misalignment

661
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:08,336
of free energy gradients. So it may be

662
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,124
that actually temporary misalignment

663
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,636
local free energy gradients from global

664
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,312
ones may facilitate the descent to fix

665
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:16,800
points in the global free energy

666
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,284
landscape that satisfy everyone at all

667
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:21,716
scales. So I'm basically expressing an

668
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:23,104
idea that's been known in various

669
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,152
communities like Stochastic optimization

670
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:27,204
and Stochastic resonance theory for

671
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,568
decades. But I think we as active

672
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:31,284
inference practitioners have a new and

673
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,076
potentially useful perspective to shed

674
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:35,188
on that, using the language of active

675
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:36,772
inference and free energy minimization

676
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,984
and Bayesian inference in general. So

677
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:40,404
instead of thinking of accelerating

678
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,616
optimization by just adding noise to the

679
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:44,476
system, we can think of exactly how to

680
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:47,084
design local generative models such that

681
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:49,692
there's an optimal misalignment of local

682
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,136
and global gradients or local and global

683
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:53,644
generative models in a way that

684
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,660
facilitates everyone in the long run

685
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,528
actually facilitating or minimizing

686
00:25:57,544 --> 00:26:00,924
their free energy. So yeah,

687
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:02,588
that's just kind of like something I'm

688
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,144
putting out there. I'm investigating it

689
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,744
now in my own work, but I have no real

690
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,248
results on that. But I just wanted to

691
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:08,976
put that out there in this venue because

692
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:11,476
I think it maybe will inspire other

693
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:14,468
people to think in a similar way. So

694
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,456
just to conclude, now, multiscale active

695
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,264
inference, I would say, is still largely

696
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:20,944
based on theoretical or philosophical

697
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,236
descriptions and illustrious

698
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,088
simulations, but we're still lacking a

699
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:27,096
formal theory. There's some theory in

700
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,504
terms of the renormalization group

701
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,452
arguments of the monograph, but they're

702
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:31,736
still, in my opinion, a bit

703
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,272
underdeveloped, a little under

704
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,550
demonstrated and relying on some

705
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,964
restrictive assumptions like the fast

706
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:40,584
and slow fluctuations, the identity

707
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,864
between generative model, generative

708
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,456
process. There's a few more recent

709
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:47,916
papers, those two by Kaufman at all and

710
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:50,712
then by myself on spingglass systems

711
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,636
that have attempted particular proofs of

712
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,396
multi scale Bayesian inference systems

713
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:56,544
in particular situations, but their

714
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,336
generality is still not known and not

715
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:00,916
proven. So what I'm kind of trying to

716
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:02,468
conclude with is by saying we need to

717
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:03,812
incorporate findings from other

718
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,684
disciplines related to the role of

719
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:08,164
noise, conflict and frustration in

720
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:11,276
facilitating, not subverting collective

721
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,828
intelligence or collective coordination.

722
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,736
And I think we can really benefit by

723
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,264
looking at these other disciplines to

724
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:21,076
help us build a really powerful formal

725
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:22,916
theory of multiscale active inference.

726
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:24,776
And finally, I think we need to set the

727
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:26,856
goalpost for what counts as a formal

728
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:28,856
proof of multiscale active inference.

729
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:30,888
And once we get there, once we're

730
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:32,376
saying, okay, this counts as proof,

731
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:34,284
this is satisfying, how can we use that

732
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:37,136
to actually do the hardest part, in my

733
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:39,200
opinion, which is engineering actual

734
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,456
multiscale active inference systems that

735
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:42,976
are intelligent and minimizing free

736
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:46,384
energy at multiple scales. Yeah,

737
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,204
so with that, I'm going to conclude

738
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,304
looks like I'm just on time. So, yeah,

739
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,196
thank you again for the invitation to

740
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,048
present, and I'd like to thank a bunch

741
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:56,608
of people who are listed here and beyond

742
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,628
who have influenced my thinking and kind

743
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:01,500
of my opinions. If there's time, I'm

744
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,050
happy to take any questions.

745
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,104
Awesome. Great talk.

746
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,056
I'll just give a few seconds if anybody

747
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:15,416
wants to type in a question. Also, it's

748
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:18,808
really cool. Like, aswin in the previous

749
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:22,364
session was highlighting Pymdp and just

750
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:25,484
the way in which we

751
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,080
enact the collective intelligence.

752
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,696
Different people seeing a paper where an

753
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:32,012
analytical formalization is introduced,

754
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,696
and then there's still so much work to

755
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:36,144
get it to the package, and then so much

756
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:38,192
more work to take it to the last mile.

757
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:40,276
And I think your presentation really

758
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:43,588
checked a lot of those boxes. I'll just

759
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:46,916
read a question and then that will just

760
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,776
be an appetizer for our continued

761
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:52,730
discussion. So Marco Lynn asked,

762
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,332
do you expect the inferentially

763
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:57,960
connected dynamics to exhibit behavior

764
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,320
akin to theories of multi body systems?

765
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,260
And to what extent can we transfer

766
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,350
insights from that multi body of work?

767
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,508
And then second question, just for our

768
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:13,516
thinking and learning from Marco, have

769
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:17,084
you explored integrating work on

770
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,936
self organized criticality with multi

771
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:20,704
scale active inference or other

772
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:22,336
frameworks? Who can provide more

773
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,528
flexible frameworks or assumptions for a

774
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,940
generic notion of multiscale dynamics?

775
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,824
Great questions. I hope that we can

776
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,416
continue, have you back anytime, or just

777
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,176
continue to collaborate in the

778
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:35,916
ecosystem. So thank you for the epic

779
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,916
talk, Connor, and good luck finishing

780
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:40,616
your PhD. Thanks a lot, Daniel. Yeah,

781
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,550
I'll talk to you soon. Talk to you soon.
