1
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,183
Daniel: And it's a great segue from

2
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:13,422
collective behavior in surprise

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:16,731
minimizing agents to collective behavior

4
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,055
in surprise minimizing agents, I guess.

5
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,217
Welcome, Conor.

6
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,309
Conor: Hey.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,510
Sorry, I just turned on my audio, so I

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,695
just heard the last thing you said.

9
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:26,740
Yeah.

10
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:27,878
Hey, welcome.

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:29,054
Yes, thanks.

12
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:32,341
Daniel: Um, we're looking forward to your

13
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,423
presentation.

14
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,623
Multi agent active inference and

15
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:36,796
multiscale alignment, current

16
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:38,975
developments and challenges.

17
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:41,238
So feel free to share your screen or

18
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,435
proceed however you prefer.

19
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:44,576
Conor: Great, thanks.

20
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,804
And before I start, because I've had

21
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:49,052
issues with my voice saturating, like my

22
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:52,300
microphone saturating, how's my audio?

23
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,398
Is it clipping at all?

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,539
Or does this sound okay?

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,764
Daniel: This is good and I'm watching it.

26
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:56,764
.

27
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:57,883
Conor: Okay, perfect.

28
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,979
Thank you.

29
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,768
I will share my screen.

30
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:07,232
Share this one.

31
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:09,406
Daniel: The one thing I'll note oh, yes.

32
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:09,449
Conor: OK.

33
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,654
Daniel: It's just JF symbolic

34
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,918
implementation does not use statistical

35
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:15,026
distributions.

36
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:19,448
It uses the symbolic and the logical

37
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:20,572
inference.

38
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:23,816
And now we're going to move back into the

39
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,027
distributional space, and it will be

40
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,209
awesome to see similarities and

41
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,297
differences.

42
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,549
So thank you, Conor, to you for the

43
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,644
presentation.

44
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:34,977
Conor: And thank you, Daniel, for the

45
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,192
introduction and for inviting me, as well

46
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:39,402
as big thank you to the other organizers

47
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:41,596
of the Third Applied Active Influence

48
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:41,669
Symposium.

49
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,974
Yeah, I'm really happy to be here to

50
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:45,002
present.

51
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,007
So.

52
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,020
My name is Conor Heins.

53
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:49,041
I'm a PhD student at the Max Planck

54
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,058
Institute of Animal Behavior.

55
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,093
And I'm also a researcher at the Versus

56
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,108
AI research lab.

57
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:57,120
R D lab.

58
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,092
So I'm going to do something a little bit,

59
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,115
, I guess, unconventional for people in

60
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:03,122
my position.

61
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,142
Like, I'm a junior researcher coming to

62
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:06,151
the end of my PhD.

63
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,177
So usually when I give a talk, I would

64
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:11,203
present on my own research, like what I'

65
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:13,228
've been up to for the last ten years

66
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:14,236
working on.

67
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:17,260
But instead of that, I'm actually going

68
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,285
to talk about given the motivation of the

69
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,305
symposium, I'm going to talk about

70
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:23,329
something that's more of an overview or

71
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,352
perspective on the current state of the

72
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:28,376
field in multiscale active inference or

73
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:31,401
multi agent active inference and what, in

74
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,425
my opinion, we need to do to move forward

75
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,437
as a field.

76
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:37,464
I think that's very resonant with the

77
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:40,494
kind of motivations and the title, indeed,

78
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,508
, of this symposium.

79
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:44,532
So I'm going to give a general analysis

80
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,555
of what multiscale active inference is,

81
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,567
why it's important.

82
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,592
I'm going to provide a brief analysis of

83
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:52,616
its formal basis as it currently stands,

84
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:55,640
and then what we need to develop in this

85
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,665
kind of subdiscipline of active inference,

86
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,688
, multiscale active inference, to really

87
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:02,652
make it rigorous and really to actually

88
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,677
reap the benefits of what it promises.

89
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,719
So generally, active inference has been

90
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,744
used a lot to design agents that can

91
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,771
solve problems, plan, and just generally

92
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,800
emulate behavior that we deem intelligent,

93
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,823
, which includes things like risk

94
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:21,848
sensitive decision making, intrinsic

95
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,875
motivations to resolve uncertainty, and

96
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,896
finally, from a more scientific

97
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:29,921
standpoint, the ability to furnish a

98
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,945
process theory about how biological

99
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,970
brains actually might work.

100
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,006
But in a lot of the theoretical work on

101
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:40,031
active inference from the last ten years

102
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,056
or ten plus years, really, there's also

103
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,079
alongside all the kind of practical

104
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,105
building adaptive agents, there's a claim

105
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,129
that active inference is inherently or

106
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,153
intrinsically multiscale from the very

107
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,162
get go.

108
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:55,179
It is a multiscale framework.

109
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,200
It's not just about building single

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,205
agents.

111
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:00,177
So it's really whenever we write down a

112
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:03,202
single active inference agent, what we're

113
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,224
implicitly implying is also a nested

114
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,249
hierarchy of active inference agents both

115
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,261
below and above.

116
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:11,287
So colloquially, you'll often see this in

117
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,309
papers as the idea that there's Markov

118
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:16,333
blankets all the way down Markov blanket

119
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,355
is a statistical structure that's very

120
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:20,377
kind of intrinsic to the definition of

121
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:23,400
agents as they are defined under active

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,410
inference.

123
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,426
So I'm not going to get into defining

124
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:25,428
that.

125
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,450
I'm kind of assuming that there's a more

126
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,469
disciplinarian audience there, but I'm

127
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,486
sure other talks, for instance, can

128
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,499
provide better clarity.

129
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,518
So yeah, Markov blanket's active

130
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:37,541
inference all the way down, all the way

131
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,543
up.

132
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,570
And at any given scale, crucially, the

133
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,595
free energy minimizing dynamics, or the

134
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,618
active inference dynamics are kind of

135
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,645
claimed to be aligned with or parallel to

136
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:50,670
the free energy minimizing gradients at

137
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,690
the level below and above.

138
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,718
So the claim is that as agents are doing

139
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:57,744
their thing and doing active inference at

140
00:04:57,744 --> 00:04:59,765
one level, it both entails and is

141
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:02,733
constrained by active inference processes

142
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,753
of the macro agent that they're

143
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:05,767
participating in.

144
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:08,794
So I'm a cell that's part of a tissue as

145
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:10,819
well as the micro agents that comprise

146
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:11,824
them.

147
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,846
I am a free energy minimizing cellular

148
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,868
agent comprised of organelles that are

149
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,886
also minimizing free energy.

150
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,924
So this kind of constrained neat nested

151
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:24,953
gradient descent on free energy is part

152
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,978
of the story of multiscale active

153
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:27,988
inference.

154
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,012
And it also crucially, assumes that these

155
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:31,029
dynamics are aligned, correlated

156
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,052
cooperative across these different scales.

157
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:34,053
.

158
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:36,075
So I should mention that there is a

159
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,097
formal argument made more recently, I

160
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:41,120
would say in the last five years, about

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,134
how this is possible.

162
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:44,155
And it relies on an apparatus from

163
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,173
statistical physics called the

164
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,188
Renormalization group.

165
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,218
This basically allows you to analytically

166
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,244
identify shared symmetries energy and

167
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:56,273
conservation laws at different scales in

168
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,297
a given system that's comprised of

169
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:01,261
subsystems and subsystems, so on

170
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,271
infinitum.

171
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:05,301
So there's a formal argument specifically

172
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,326
made in a free energy principle for a

173
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,355
particular physics monograph in 2019 that

174
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,377
applies the renormalization group

175
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:15,402
apparatus to multivariate stochastic

176
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:17,429
differential equations that are kind of

177
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,451
the equivalent of agents.

178
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:22,476
So you can apply that framework to

179
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,500
certain sorts of coupled stochastic

180
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,524
differential equations that exhibit

181
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,546
Markov blanketed sparse coupling

182
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:30,555
structure.

183
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,578
And you can kind of prove analytically

184
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:35,602
that there are going to be nested systems

185
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:37,624
of Markov blankets and that they're all

186
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,646
in some sense minimizing three energies

187
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,660
at their own scales.

188
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,685
So I'll get more into that argument later,

189
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,708
, but I just want to mention that as I

190
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,731
define multiscale active inference that

191
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:50,756
there is a formal argument that's related

192
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:51,761
to it.

193
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:54,791
So this slide I just put together to

194
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,810
demonstrate the idea of nested free

195
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,832
energy minimizing processes visually.

196
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,798
So at a given scale, we can think of an

197
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:03,823
agent as occupying some point in its free

198
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,847
energy landscape indicated by this red

199
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,867
orb, which represents, say, its

200
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,889
configuration, its beliefs, and its

201
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:10,897
actions.

202
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,921
And it performs active inference and in

203
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,942
doing so minimizes its free energy.

204
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:17,963
So it changes the position of that ball

205
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:18,973
on that landscape.

206
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:20,989
And that is all we mean when we say

207
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:20,997
active inference.

208
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,020
That corresponds to the agent doing

209
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,044
inference and doing action and kind of

210
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,069
getting to the fixed point of its local

211
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,085
free energy landscape.

212
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:31,108
The multi agent case is simply when we

213
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,125
add more of these processes.

214
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,149
So there's other agents usually assumed

215
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,170
to be similar agents, and the word

216
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,196
similarity, let's put an asterisk on that.

217
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:40,198
.

218
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,216
And they're all sitting at different

219
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,231
points in their own free energy

220
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:44,238
landscapes.

221
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:47,266
The position of their local red ball is

222
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,282
maybe in a different place.

223
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:52,317
So the claim of multiscale active

224
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,338
inference is that as we link these

225
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:57,365
multiple active inference agents together,

226
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,384
, so they can actually exchange

227
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:02,350
information like observations and actions

228
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,374
with each other, what we automatically

229
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,398
get is some kind of superagent that is

230
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,423
also minimizing variation of free energy

231
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,445
and is in some sense an emergent or

232
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:14,472
Supervenient active inference agent.

233
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,498
And I say the word, we automatically get

234
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:19,522
a superagent with an asterisk because

235
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,544
there may be some conditions on that

236
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,570
mapping from local to global that have to

237
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,582
be elucidated.

238
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,606
So we'll come back to that in a bit.

239
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,634
But in short, I think the definition of

240
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,659
multiscale active inference is very

241
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,685
eloquently put in this paper by Rafael

242
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:38,715
Kaufman, Pranav Gupta, and Jacob Taylor.

243
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:40,739
I think Rafael Kaufman is actually going

244
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,754
to be on the panel later.

245
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,780
And this line from their paper is a

246
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,806
really nice, I think, just summary of

247
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:48,815
what it is.

248
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:50,833
So I'll just read it out loud.

249
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,857
The upshot is that in theory, any active

250
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:54,879
inference agent at one Spaciotemporal

251
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,902
scale could be simultaneously composed of

252
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,923
nested active inference agents at the

253
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,886
scale below and constituent of a larger

254
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,910
active inference agent at the scale above

255
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:04,915
it.

256
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,937
In effect, active inference allows you to

257
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,957
pick a composite system or agent A that

258
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,970
you want to understand.

259
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:13,000
And it will be generally true that both

260
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,027
that agent A is an approximate global

261
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:18,056
minimizer of free energy at the scale at

262
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:21,085
which that agent reliably persists, and

263
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:24,114
that agent A is composed of subsystems A,

264
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:26,138
sub I that are approximate local

265
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:29,162
minimizers with free energy.

266
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:32,192
So that is the claim as I'm going to

267
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:35,223
continue evaluating in this talk, and I

268
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:38,254
think it's just a great reference point

269
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:41,284
to make, okay, that's what multiscale

270
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,303
active inference is.

271
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,314
Why is it important?

272
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,330
Why do we actually care about that?

273
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,349
That sounds philosophically nice and

274
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:49,367
beautiful visually, but why is that

275
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,373
important?

276
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,391
So there's a ton of actually really

277
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,411
important implications of this, both for

278
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,430
the engineering and the natural sciences.

279
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:56,431
.

280
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,457
First of all, the namesake of this

281
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:01,422
symposium, I assume inspired by this

282
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:04,451
recent paper by Karl Frison and all about

283
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:06,477
enacting ecosystems of parenthetically

284
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:08,493
shared intelligence.

285
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:10,513
So this is the third applied active

286
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:11,523
inference symposium.

287
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,548
So to really make this resonate with the

288
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:16,570
applied aspect, let's make this very

289
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:16,576
concrete.

290
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:18,599
If we can figure out this multiscale

291
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:21,623
endeavor, then we can actually engineer

292
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,642
distributed systems of multiaging

293
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:25,667
intelligence where local agents, in doing

294
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,690
their own little local active inference

295
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,710
processes, are also cooperatively

296
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,734
instantiating a global agent that's also

297
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,755
performing active inference.

298
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,781
This has huge computational potential, of

299
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:39,806
course, compared to kind of the state of

300
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,824
the art predominant methods for

301
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,848
artificial intelligence, which are deep

302
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:45,867
learning, which really is about

303
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,892
propagating global information through an

304
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,911
entire computation graph.

305
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:51,928
So although you could argue back

306
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,948
propagation is local in some sense, it's

307
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:55,965
really not local in the way that

308
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,986
multiscale active inference progresses to

309
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:58,992
be local.

310
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,954
So if we can figure out how to actually

311
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:02,976
engineer multiscale active inference, it

312
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,997
will have really tremendous implications

313
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,018
for the study of artificial intelligence

314
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,034
just from that pure engineering

315
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,042
standpoint.

316
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:10,058
It'll be cheaper.

317
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:12,078
In one word, it'll be computationally

318
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,093
energetically, memory wise.

319
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:14,098
Cheaper.

320
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:15,109
A lot cheaper.

321
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:18,136
Secondly, from a kind of more natural

322
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,159
sciences motivation, which is kind of

323
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,184
where I'm coming from, I'm doing a PhD in

324
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,208
biology, so I'm interested in questions

325
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,233
about actual real systems in nature.

326
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,257
Just the idea of being able to get super

327
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,280
specific and rigorous about phrases like

328
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,297
emergent intelligence, emergent

329
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,318
computation, collective intelligence,

330
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:39,342
superorganism that's often thrown around.

331
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:39,344
.

332
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,361
We're talking about social insects,

333
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:41,364
right?

334
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,387
These are terms that you hear thrown

335
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:45,408
around in many different scientific

336
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,431
disciplines that deal with multi agent

337
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:49,448
systems, network systems.

338
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,472
But none of these terms, to my knowledge,

339
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,490
have really rigorous or precise

340
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,497
conditions.

341
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:57,519
Multiscale active inference is a kind of

342
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,538
framework that's in the position to

343
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:00,499
provide those rigorous definitions and

344
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,507
conditions.

345
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:04,536
So from a scientific standpoint, it could

346
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:07,561
really lend a lot of potential and

347
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,583
usefulness for other scientific

348
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,593
disciplines.

349
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,617
And finally, another pragmatic motivation.

350
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:12,617
.

351
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:15,646
There's loads of fields that are obsessed

352
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:18,671
with designing and engineering systems

353
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,698
where local, selfish individual behavior

354
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,725
can lead when networked appropriately to

355
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,749
some desired collective outcome.

356
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:27,765
And these disciplines really want to

357
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,784
figure out how to engineer that properly.

358
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:29,784
.

359
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,808
So this goes from the design of financial

360
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:34,831
markets and trading systems all the way

361
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,853
down to how do you design a multiplayer

362
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:37,861
video game?

363
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,893
So that's kind of just motivating.

364
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,913
Why is multiscale active inference even

365
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:43,919
interesting?

366
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:45,945
So then the question, of course, becomes,

367
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,965
is the multiscale active inference claim

368
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:48,973
actually true?

369
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:50,997
Are all multi agent active inference

370
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,019
systems comprised of and themselves

371
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,044
comprise nested hierarchy of free energy

372
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,058
minimization agents?

373
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,081
A glance at a smattering of other

374
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:01,045
scientific disciplines that specifically

375
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,065
deal with multiple agents, multiple

376
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,086
interests, collective phenomena like

377
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:07,109
coordination, group behavior, collective

378
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:09,120
intelligence.

379
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,140
A glance at all those disciplines would

380
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,159
naively suggest that the answer is no.

381
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,185
So there's things like frustration in

382
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:18,211
thermodynamic systems game theory, the

383
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,238
very existence of zero sum games and mass

384
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:23,264
equilibria bandwagon effects when we're

385
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:26,292
talking about social networks and opinion

386
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,301
dynamics.

387
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,331
Sacrifices for the common good, which we

388
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,354
see in different contexts in biology,

389
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,379
like in the context of kin selection, but

390
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,401
also in the context of arguably cell

391
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,414
death in a tissue.

392
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:41,443
These are all basically plenty of systems

393
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:43,461
where local constraints and global

394
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:45,480
constraints or desires or free energy

395
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,501
gradients, whatever you want to call them,

396
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,517
, come into direct conflict.

397
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:51,541
So the obvious example that I listed at

398
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,565
the top of these bullets is the idea of

399
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,587
geometric frustration that we see in

400
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:58,612
Icing systems with very low temperature.

401
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,576
So these Icing models basically describe

402
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,597
lattices of Ferromagnets that are happy

403
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,615
when they're pointing in the same

404
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:06,632
direction as their neighboring

405
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,653
Ferromagnets and they can be in an up or

406
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:09,663
a down state.

407
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,688
So basically the magnet can be pointing

408
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:13,700
up or pointing down.

409
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:15,722
And these global systems are defined by a

410
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,741
global energy function and the whole

411
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:18,758
system is in some sense trying to

412
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,778
minimize that global energy function.

413
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,799
But sometimes you'll find cases in these

414
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,819
collective systems where this little spin

415
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:26,837
in the middle cannot be happy because

416
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,856
they're getting conflicting information

417
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:29,867
from two neighbors.

418
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,890
I want to be pointing up in blue like the

419
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,912
agent on the left, but I also want to be

420
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,935
pointing down like the agent on the right.

421
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:36,936
.

422
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,959
So this is a system that's collectively

423
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,980
finding some fixed point of its global

424
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,003
free energy, but it's actually leading to

425
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,026
a local conflict where this agent is not

426
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:47,047
at a point where it can do anything to

427
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,068
make itself happy or minimize its free

428
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,080
energy further.

429
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:54,110
So just from even the basic glance at

430
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,139
Ferromagnetic lattices, we already see

431
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,164
instances where local and global

432
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,135
gradients or local and global optima are

433
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,161
not aligned in the right way.

434
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,188
So given all this, the burden of proof

435
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,211
for multiscale active inference is still

436
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:10,216
on us.

437
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:13,243
So we need to show that collective active

438
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,268
inference systems generically do align

439
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,282
again across scales.

440
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,306
And maybe if we can put an X across the

441
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:21,326
word generically and it's not some

442
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:24,350
automatic condition, if they don't, then

443
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,375
at least we have to establish exactly the

444
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,394
conditions in which they do.

445
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,440
So anecdotally we do actually have some

446
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,450
conditions.

447
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,477
There seem to be some kind of basic

448
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,502
ingredients to get collective active

449
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:40,515
inference to work.

450
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:43,541
So one is that we basically need agents

451
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,566
to exchange actions and sensations across

452
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,584
some kind of Markov blanket.

453
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,601
This is not really a condition.

454
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:51,623
This is almost more part of what it means

455
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:52,631
to be an agent.

456
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,652
So having Markov blanket separation

457
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,673
between agents is just another way of

458
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,693
saying we have multiple agents in our

459
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:00,657
system rather than a single agent if you'

460
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:03,680
're violating the Markov blanket property.

461
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,681
.

462
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:05,706
So internal states of one agent are not

463
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:07,728
allowed to see the internal states or

464
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:09,748
external states of another agent.

465
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,765
Then you're kind of cheating because you'

466
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:12,779
're kind of saying it's actually one

467
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,781
agent.

468
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:15,801
And what you're doing is information

469
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,820
sharing within the brain of a single

470
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:17,824
agent.

471
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,846
The second condition, which is something

472
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,862
that's often hallucinated more

473
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:23,882
anecdotally and not really formally, is

474
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,902
this idea that agents need to have some

475
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,923
kind of shared narrative or shared hidden

476
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:28,939
states or censor space in their

477
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,950
generative model.

478
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:32,977
So I've worked a lot on collective active

479
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:35,001
inference systems, just simulating agents

480
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,025
and trying to get them to do interesting

481
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,037
things together.

482
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,062
And my intuitions and experience do agree

483
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,075
with this basic fact.

484
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:44,096
If the agents don't have any similarity

485
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:46,118
in what they're representing or trying to

486
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,139
achieve, then it's kind of like trying to

487
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,161
fit a square peg into a circular hole.

488
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,183
So this is really nicely elucidated in

489
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,206
one of the earliest cases in this paper,

490
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:58,230
a Duet for One by first and Fritz in 2015,

491
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,194
, where they show that for two agents to

492
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:02,218
really align, they kind of have to have a

493
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:05,240
shared generative model and then you can

494
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,260
get kind of this nice synchronized

495
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,268
behavior.

496
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:10,291
Again, though, these things like what

497
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,302
does similarity mean?

498
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,318
What does a shared narrative actually

499
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,321
mean?

500
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:14,339
Formally, mathematically, those things

501
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,353
have not been initiated yet.

502
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:18,375
So right now, a lot of the building of

503
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,397
these collective systems is based on our

504
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:23,421
intuitions and kind of engineering things

505
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,442
using some vague guidelines like, oh,

506
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,464
they should have a shared sensor space,

507
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,487
but there's no mathematical conditions or

508
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,504
guarantees about what degree of

509
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:33,526
similarity is needed between two agents

510
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:36,551
models to get the intended dynamics.

511
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:38,575
And finally, we have to have at least

512
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,597
some agreement between the generative

513
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,620
model of each agent and the generative

514
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,644
process, which is really the behavior of

515
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:48,670
the other agents generating their data.

516
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,688
So this is kind of related to the

517
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,706
previous point about having shared

518
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:52,716
generative models.

519
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:55,744
But just to be very specific, the physics

520
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:58,771
of the space that transfers your actions

521
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,738
to my observations that physics can't be

522
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,764
dramatically crazily different than how

523
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:05,788
our generative models represent those

524
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:06,797
physics.

525
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,818
So if we took two fish with the same

526
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,841
generative model of each other and they

527
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,864
normally would school together in a fish

528
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:15,887
tank, but we throw them in a volcano or

529
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,910
shoot them out into outer space they won'

530
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:18,914
't.

531
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:19,920
School together.

532
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,942
Because then the generative process is so

533
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,963
dramatically deviating from the way they

534
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,982
are representing that physics, the way

535
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:27,000
their generative model is constructed.

536
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,002
So these are, again just ingredients,

537
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,004
kind of guidelines or anecdotes.

538
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:32,005
But there's nothing really rigorous

539
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,006
behind these conditions.

540
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:35,008
They're more like a list of best

541
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,009
practices.

542
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:38,011
So now let's get on to actual rigorous

543
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,012
stuff.

544
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:41,014
So, the first real rigorous attempt to

545
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:43,016
show that multiscale active inference

546
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,018
generally works is in one section of this

547
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:47,020
free energy principle for a particular

548
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,022
physics monograph from 2019.

549
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,024
So it leverages this apparatus I

550
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,026
mentioned earlier, the Renormalization

551
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,028
group operator, to basically show how one

552
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:56,029
can successively coarse grain

553
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,031
multivariate stochastic differential

554
00:18:58,031 --> 00:19:00,027
equations that admit sparse coupling

555
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,029
between their state variables.

556
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,032
So the main result in my mind that

557
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:07,034
connects these renormalization group

558
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,036
results to multiscale active inference is

559
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:12,039
the fact that the Lagrangian of the

560
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,041
system at one scale can be expressed as a

561
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,043
function of the Lagrangian at other

562
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:17,044
scales.

563
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,047
And that applies in a scale invariant

564
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,050
fashion that is the main kind of output

565
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,052
or the main benefit of using a

566
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,054
renormalization group apparatus.

567
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,056
So you can kind of think of Lagrangian

568
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,058
like the generative model.

569
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,060
It's a physics term, but it's related to

570
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,062
the generative model of the agents that

571
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,064
comprise the system and therefore also

572
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,065
their free energy.

573
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,067
So in terms of active inference, it means

574
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,068
that this reasoning of the

575
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:43,070
renormalization group can be used to

576
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,072
smoothly move between the models of

577
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,074
individual agents at one scale and the

578
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,076
model of a collective or larger agent at

579
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,078
a different scale or a smaller scale for

580
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,079
that matter.

581
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,081
And the nice thing about it is general

582
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:56,083
for all kinds of dynamics and thus

583
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,085
generative models, it doesn't depend

584
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,081
heavily on the form of the stochastic

585
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,083
differential equations that form your

586
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,084
system.

587
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,088
The issues with it is that there's not a

588
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,090
global link to Bayesian mechanics and

589
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,091
active inference.

590
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,093
It's still all done in the traditional

591
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:13,094
physics formalism.

592
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:16,096
So we don't actually have an explicit

593
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,098
link to local inference and global

594
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,099
inference.

595
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:20,101
Although if you know the connection

596
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,103
between the Lagrangian and the generative

597
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:23,104
model and the free energy, then you can

598
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,105
make that connection.

599
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,108
But it's not actually made explicitly for

600
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,109
us in this part of the monograph.

601
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,111
It also requires the assumption that the

602
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,113
generative model and the generative

603
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,115
process are identical at the local level

604
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,117
that's related to how the Lagrangian is

605
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
defined.

606
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,119
That's also restrictive assumption.

607
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,121
That's probably not realistic in my

608
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:40,121
opinion.

609
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:43,124
And then finally, there's something about

610
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:45,126
kind of spatiotemporal segregation of

611
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:46,126
scales.

612
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,129
So we need to make assumptions about how

613
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,131
fast random fluctuations are at one scale

614
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,133
relative to another scale in order to

615
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,135
justify kind of coarse grading or

616
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,137
forgetting about certain states as you

617
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,139
move between scales.

618
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,135
And that's also something that you could

619
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
argue.

620
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:03,138
Current research into collective dynamics

621
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,141
challenges that assumption about how fast

622
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:09,144
noise is at one scale relative to the

623
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
next.

624
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,147
So now I'm going to discuss quickly

625
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,149
another small contingent of active

626
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,151
inference research that is attempted to

627
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,153
address this mapping between local and

628
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,154
global inference processes.

629
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,156
So what I want to kind of just generally

630
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,158
say with this presentation and to our

631
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,159
community is that the kind of approach

632
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
taken in these two papers, first of all,

633
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,163
active inference model of collective

634
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,165
intelligence and spin glass systems as

635
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,166
collective active inference.

636
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,168
This is one of the types of research I

637
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,170
think we really need to move active

638
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,172
inference, multiscale active inference

639
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:38,173
forward.

640
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,175
So I'm not trying to be too biased

641
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,176
because I am the first author on the

642
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,178
second of those papers, but I'll also be

643
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,179
the first one to point out the limitation.

644
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,180
.

645
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,181
But benefits wise, I think these

646
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,184
approaches are really important because

647
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,186
they formally relate a local generative

648
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,188
model at one scale to a global generative

649
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,190
model at a different scale.

650
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,192
So really tie, how do the parameters of

651
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,194
one model relate to a course grade

652
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
model?

653
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,190
And these are really good steps in the

654
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,192
direction of a formal theory of

655
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:06,195
collective intelligence that goes from

656
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:08,197
local intelligences to global

657
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:09,198
intelligence.

658
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,200
However, there's still issues with these.

659
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,200
.

660
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,203
One of them is that they only deal with

661
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:16,205
issue with inference at the global level,

662
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:17,206
not active inference.

663
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,209
So both these papers concern with a bunch

664
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,211
of local active inference agents that

665
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,213
cooperate to form a global inference

666
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,215
agent, like a passive baying agent,

667
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,217
rather than an active inference agent.

668
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:31,220
And it's also unclear whether the systems

669
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,222
studying these papers are actually very

670
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:34,223
generic.

671
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,225
Like the results are generic to studying

672
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,227
collective intelligence in general, or

673
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,229
they're nice formal arguments, but they'

674
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,231
're only applicable to these specific

675
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:42,231
systems.

676
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:45,234
So we still don't have something that's

677
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,236
even more kind of zoomed out and abstract

678
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:49,238
than these, which tend to be a little bit

679
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,239
case specific.

680
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:52,241
And finally, the actual scale

681
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:54,243
transcendence that we're doing in these

682
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:57,246
papers is still relegated to really one

683
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:57,246
step.

684
00:22:57,246 --> 00:23:00,243
We're not doing the full multiscale

685
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:03,246
infinite scale regression that something

686
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,248
like Renormalization group promises.

687
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,251
So that's kind of the current overview of

688
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,253
what I think are the most promising

689
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,255
directions in multiscale active inference.

690
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:12,255
.

691
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:14,257
And I'm aware on time, sorry, five

692
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:14,257
minutes.

693
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,260
So I'm going to quickly try to go through

694
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,262
what I think are really promising

695
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,265
directions to push in terms of multiscale

696
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:24,267
active inference and kind of intuition

697
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,269
pumps that I think will help us study

698
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:29,272
these systems in a way that's different

699
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,274
and also actually better informed by

700
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,276
other research disciplines.

701
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:36,279
So the general idea that I'd like to put

702
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,281
forward is that misaligned gradients can

703
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,283
actually be a good thing.

704
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,285
So it's actually sometimes good when

705
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,287
local free energy gradients are

706
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,289
misaligned with global gradients.

707
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:48,291
So sometimes the global system will

708
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,294
actually do better if the local systems

709
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:52,295
are performing worse.

710
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,297
So this is something you could call

711
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,299
multiscale conflict, where the free

712
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,301
energy minimizing processes at one scale

713
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,297
are actually doing bad, quote unquote,

714
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,299
but it's because they're being driven by

715
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,301
some higher scale process that is doing

716
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,302
well.

717
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:07,304
So rather than trying to always avoid

718
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,306
constructing processes like this, I think

719
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,308
this kind of frustration, to use the

720
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,310
analogy from statistical physics, can

721
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,312
actually be an inspiration for what we

722
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:17,314
should investigate further because it

723
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:20,317
actually might be key to facilitating

724
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,319
optimality at different scales.

725
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,323
The reason I put this forward is because

726
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:28,325
there's loads of research, just recent

727
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:30,327
research in the last several years that

728
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:33,330
are suggesting that actually making local

729
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,332
agents more frustrated or more unhappy

730
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:36,333
might coincidentally or not

731
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,336
coincidentally lead to better collective

732
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,337
or global outcomes.

733
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:43,340
So this is expressed in various forms in

734
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,341
various bodies of work.

735
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,343
One of the biggest patterns I've noticed

736
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,345
is the study of collective behavioral

737
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:50,347
systems over the last several decades is

738
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:52,349
the idea that local noise and local

739
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,352
Dysregulation can often facilitate global

740
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,354
coherence or global coordination.

741
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,356
And where multiscale active inference has

742
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,352
something to say, in my opinion, is in

743
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,355
framing this benefit of local frustration

744
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,357
in terms of a misalignment of free energy

745
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,358
gradients.

746
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,360
So it may be that actually temporary

747
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,363
misalignment local free energy gradients

748
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:14,365
from global ones may facilitate the

749
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,367
descent to fix points in the global free

750
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,370
energy landscape that satisfy everyone at

751
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,370
all scales.

752
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,373
So I'm basically expressing an idea that'

753
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,375
's been known in various communities like

754
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,377
Stochastic optimization and Stochastic

755
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:27,378
resonance theory for decades.

756
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:29,380
But I think we as active inference

757
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,382
practitioners have a new and potentially

758
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,384
useful perspective to shed on that, using

759
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,386
the language of active inference and free

760
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:37,388
energy minimization and Bayesian

761
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:38,389
inference in general.

762
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,391
So instead of thinking of accelerating

763
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:42,393
optimization by just adding noise to the

764
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:44,395
system, we can think of exactly how to

765
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,398
design local generative models such that

766
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,400
there's an optimal misalignment of local

767
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,402
and global gradients or local and global

768
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,404
generative models in a way that

769
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
facilitates everyone in the long run

770
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,408
actually facilitating or minimizing their

771
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:58,409
free energy.

772
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:01,406
So yeah, that's just kind of like

773
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,408
something I'm putting out there.

774
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,409
I'm investigating it now in my own work,

775
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,411
but I have no real results on that.

776
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
But I just wanted to put that out there

777
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,415
in this venue because I think it maybe

778
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,417
will inspire other people to think in a

779
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,418
similar way.

780
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:15,420
So just to conclude, now, multiscale

781
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,423
active inference, I would say, is still

782
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:19,424
largely based on theoretical or

783
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,426
philosophical descriptions and

784
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,428
illustrious simulations, but we're still

785
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,430
lacking a formal theory.

786
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,432
There's some theory in terms of the

787
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,434
renormalization group arguments of the

788
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,436
monograph, but they're still, in my

789
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,438
opinion, a bit underdeveloped, a little

790
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,440
under demonstrated and relying on some

791
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,442
restrictive assumptions like the fast and

792
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,445
slow fluctuations, the identity between

793
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,447
generative model, generative process.

794
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,450
There's a few more recent papers, those

795
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,452
two by Kaufman at all and then by myself

796
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:50,455
on spingglass systems that have attempted

797
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,457
particular proofs of multi scale Bayesian

798
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,459
inference systems in particular

799
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,462
situations, but their generality is still

800
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,463
not known and not proven.

801
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,460
So what I'm kind of trying to conclude

802
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,462
with is by saying we need to incorporate

803
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,464
findings from other disciplines related

804
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,466
to the role of noise, conflict and

805
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:09,468
frustration in facilitating, not

806
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:12,471
subverting collective intelligence or

807
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:13,472
collective coordination.

808
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,475
And I think we can really benefit by

809
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,477
looking at these other disciplines to

810
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:20,479
help us build a really powerful formal

811
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,481
theory of multiscale active inference.

812
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,483
And finally, I think we need to set the

813
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:26,485
goalpost for what counts as a formal

814
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:28,487
proof of multiscale active inference.

815
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:31,490
And once we get there, once we're saying,

816
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,492
okay, this counts as proof, this is

817
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:34,493
satisfying, how can we use that to

818
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:36,495
actually do the hardest part, in my

819
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:38,497
opinion, which is engineering actual

820
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:41,499
multiscale active inference systems that

821
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:42,501
are intelligent and minimizing free

822
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,503
energy at multiple scales.

823
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:48,507
Yeah, so with that, I'm going to conclude

824
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,508
looks like I'm just on time.

825
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:51,510
So, yeah, thank you again for the

826
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,512
invitation to present, and I'd like to

827
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,514
thank a bunch of people who are listed

828
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,516
here and beyond who have influenced my

829
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:59,518
thinking and kind of my opinions.

830
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
If there's time, I'm happy to take any

831
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,516
questions.

832
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,520
Daniel: Awesome.

833
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,523
Great talk.

834
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,525
I'll just give a few seconds if anybody

835
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,527
wants to type in a question.

836
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,528
Also, it's really cool.

837
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,532
Like, aswin in the previous session was

838
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,535
highlighting Pymdp and just the way in

839
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,538
which we enact the collective

840
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,540
intelligence.

841
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,542
Different people seeing a paper where an

842
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,544
analytical formalization is introduced,

843
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,546
and then there's still so much work to

844
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,548
get it to the package, and then so much

845
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,551
more work to take it to the last mile.

846
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,553
And I think your presentation really

847
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,555
checked a lot of those boxes.

848
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:46,559
I'll just read a question and then that

849
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,561
will just be an appetizer for our

850
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,563
continued discussion.

851
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,566
So Marco Lynn asked, do you expect the

852
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
inferentially connected dynamics to

853
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,572
exhibit behavior akin to theories of

854
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,568
multi body systems?

855
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,570
And to what extent can we transfer

856
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,573
insights from that multi body of work?

857
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,577
And then second question, just for our

858
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,579
thinking and learning from Marco, have

859
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:15,582
you explored integrating work on self

860
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:18,585
organized criticality with multi scale

861
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,588
active inference or other frameworks?

862
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:23,590
Who can provide more flexible frameworks

863
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,592
or assumptions for a generic notion of

864
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:26,593
multiscale dynamics?

865
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:28,595
Great questions.

866
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:31,597
I hope that we can continue, have you

867
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:32,599
back anytime, or just continue to

868
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,601
collaborate in the ecosystem.

869
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
So thank you for the epic talk, Conor,

870
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,605
and good luck finishing your PhD.

871
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,607
Conor: Thanks a lot, Daniel.

872
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:41,608
Yeah, I'll talk to you soon.

873
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:42,609
Daniel: Talk to you soon.
