an adventure of

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
curiosity yes I'm GNA start sharing my

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,039
screen let me know if everything is all

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,800
right

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,559
uh should be

20
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,319
perfect yep

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,320
cool so this is one of my favorite memes

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,119
and

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,479
um and probably most of you know it uh

24
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,600
this reference uh is um um the cave of

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,680
platon and

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,399
uh to me it was kind of fine to

27
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,000
truth that uh now with active inference

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,439
seems like we are closer to demonstrate

29
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,200
that that how it

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
is

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,360
so um the first time that I start uh act

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,799
in and

33
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,759
serve at The Institute uh I just uh this

34
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,119
was my kind of my feeling or my face uh

35
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,759
was uh looking into something that it

36
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,240
was complex

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,400
scary and look interesting so I went and

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,959
why I decided to to go through it

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,879
um uh I Envision a world where people is

40
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,800
driving by strong incentives that

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,560
motivate them to reduce uncertainty uh

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,640
in the systems they are part of and uh

43
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,680
my Approach is through games which are

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,400
going to go later but I really on this

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,959
talk want to encourage uh all kinds of

46
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,040
persons or people that are curious and I

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,040
want them to um act and get involved in

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,239
the community because you may find that

49
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,000
uh uh for now um most of the uh actors

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
are uh scientists and very well and

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,400
reputated people and you might think

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
that you are

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,760
not uh a part of of it but uh very far

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,239
away from that uh The Institute

55
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,799
encourage uh the opposite so I'm super

56
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,959
glad to have been through this journey

57
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,799
and I wanted to share a little bit of my

58
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,519
background and then we go to the game

59
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,680
um here is the second and last meme uh

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,120
the world you were rais uh to survive is

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,400
not longer exist we are on a digital

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Revolution and with this digital

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,760
Revolution uh it comes bunch of

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,159
different um things that are evolving

65
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,400
and hopefully uh bring us to a better

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,360
world um okay who I am I'm Pablo my name

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,480
is Pablo but uh um more defined or well

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,360
much what best Define me is my action

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,599
and my

70
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,280
experiences

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,280
um

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,519
um I think uh role game plays and sports

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
and movies are super important and as a

74
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,199
kid I was uh uh dyslexic and the system

75
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,919
didn't F my necessities so I really

76
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,240
hated a school but I love learning and

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,639
it's something that I've been doing all

78
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,320
my life and it's curious how uh A system

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,000
that is designed to uh give you

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,479
knowledge and

81
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,560
to uh uh help you with the learning in

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,039
my case it didn't work at all and and

83
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,400
just that's a little uh starting point

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,199
uh uh I believe in in the copy

85
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,680
transformation and combine of things and

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
on my uh

87
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,400
adulthood uh everything uh sifted and I

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,800
became uh successful uh professional and

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,360
I love um it teams um um um what I do

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,039
for living is uh a product manager and

91
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,600
what I do on my pet projects site

92
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,400
projects call it as you want uh is

93
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,960
related to uh gaming and gamifying um uh

94
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,120
organizations and

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,800
experiences um uh nowadays I trust more

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,560
my intuition which is something that uh

97
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,199
it really was broken during my childhood

98
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,360
and you will see a little bit more about

99
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,560
that here are some things of my interest

100
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,720
uh licenses uh like open science which

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,440
is the case of the Institute philosophy

102
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,599
and that's the first meme education

103
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,199
governance family

104
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,479
art um love communication

105
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,160
technology and nature and a bunch of

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
other things that I would be happy to

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,120
share any other

108
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,440
time and one of the questions that

109
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,840
Daniel asked me for this talk is it was

110
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,800
what was exciting for me uh about all

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,080
this what right and for me I always when

112
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,199
when I I give talks I I like to

113
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,360
share a view of the last 100 years and

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,360
and and the Industrial Revolution and

115
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,319
how uh the the ones that were on this

116
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,080
world uh before us did something right

117
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm sure that we all know uh big um

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,280
mistake or big things that have fail or

119
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,960
that could be uh better through

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,919
iterations but um data it's it's very uh

121
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,080
promising and and very good I I think is

122
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,199
um inspiring to have uh this the basic

123
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,479
education how it grows uh the

124
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,280
vaccination what it dids did for us uh

125
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,440
democracy and how poverty drop drugly

126
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,479
how

127
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,879
literate it it grew and because all this

128
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,199
uh things uh child

129
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,199
mortality uh just went very

130
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,720
low um so basically the future of

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,919
education is what makes me be

132
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,759
excited

133
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,280
and how I ended on this ecosystem uh

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,680
it's super a random and I'm G to explain

135
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,360
it in hopefully two to five minutes I um

136
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
as a product manager and very interested

137
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,000
on technology I heard about blockchains

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,840
back in 2015 and I didn't understood

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,720
anything at all and then back in

140
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,479
2017 I heard about hos I didn't start

141
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,080
them did not play that game but uh it

142
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,839
was uh rasing a fun thing to consider

143
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,958
which is digital assets and ownership of

144
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,440
those digital assets uh uh for now we we

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,600
we didn't have a a technology that could

146
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
scale and that was uh good enough to

147
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,760
ensure that the digital assets that you

148
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,920
own uh where you yours and you had the

149
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,480
fre freom of

150
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,600
transaction uh on them I I did

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
understand that very fast and because

152
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm a game player and as a game player

153
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,000
you always have your different assets

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,880
and and do things with them and as well

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,760
I I I have been uh collecting music uh

156
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,640
and all kind of uh digital um assets uh

157
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,040
I bought uh this very famous collection

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,279
of uh punks and sold them very fast

159
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,959
before uh I Could Be A

160
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,279
Millionaire but due in 2021 I decided

161
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,959
that I wanted to build something and

162
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,000
then uh back then I went through this uh

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,720
beautiful project that was the first art

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,720
so on ethereum which one of the artist

165
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,279
it was Daniel uh fredman so I as a

166
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,079
curious person and a person that has

167
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,839
been working with artists I always like

168
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,640
to know what is the driver of those

169
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,399
artists uh what they do and and try to

170
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,360
get in their worlds to understand better

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,279
and to get as much information as as I

172
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,600
can uh before I decide to uh encourage

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,800
or collect or or or just deep deep

174
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,000
always uh deeper on on music or art for

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,600
me is um very nice nice thing to do so I

176
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
discover uh these cards and

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,720
education um was one of them and I went

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,399
through uh flicker which is where it was

179
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
the first at least what that I found uh

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,639
place what it was and the license it was

181
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,000
a creative common license uh of not

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,760
commercial use but uh it it was an open

183
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
license which I've been uh a part of

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,160
creative common Community for a very

185
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,880
very very long time since I was uh uh

186
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,519
working with musicians and I think is

187
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,040
one of the best things that happened to

188
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,079
the

189
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,240
internet um this is these are some of

190
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,000
the pragmatic uh uh things that uh the

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,160
audience cares cares about hopefully we

192
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,160
will have some of these on or games uh

193
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,000
AI for sure is going to be there um free

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,680
energy principle is going to be one of

195
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
the things that hopefully

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,279
we help to minimize and to make it

197
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,720
funnier games or happier games or and

198
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,440
games that help organizations to be

199
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,399
better uh the human factor uh it's super

200
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,800
important for me and implementation an

201
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,880
action I learned by doing and it's one

202
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,480
of the values that uh The Institute

203
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,000
encourage more so uh I just jump on

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,399
things and try to understand them

205
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,560
through doing and sharing as I'm doing

206
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,000
now uh here are the epistemics and um

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,560
Collective uh is one of them that I'm as

208
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,760
well uh super

209
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,760
interest um agents of course

210
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,839
uh practical and curiosity which is the

211
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,399
adventure that I'm uh I have the feeling

212
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,440
that I'm being involved all my my life

213
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,880
and that I encourage always

214
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,040
my my two girls to to be curious and to

215
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
uh open things and look behind the doors

216
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,399
and just be anactive

217
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,480
here are some values that I'd like to

218
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,839
point which are exploration uh the

219
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,320
culture of curiosity that I did mention

220
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,040
a lot um uh continuous learning uh

221
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,880
because that experience on the school I

222
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
think I I just keep going and keep going

223
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,639
and it's something that sometimes um um

224
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,079
bad experiences could turn out in good

225
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,880
habits uh learning by doing as I already

226
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
told

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,440
and integrity and inclusivity

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,160
honesty account accountability a big one

229
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
um trying to be professional on

230
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,959
everything that you do um for me all

231
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,040
started as a human being

232
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,839
curious um people of all backgrounds and

233
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,440
perspectives are welcome to

234
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,240
the to the Institute um I could I would

235
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,959
be very happy to be the link and to

236
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,560
speak with uh uh someone that has doubts

237
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,000
or if I can help I think I could help on

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,199
the very early stage and and if you're

239
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,399
not very technical person I think I

240
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,079
could help there and and yeah and as we

241
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,880
are learning by doing I would love to

242
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,279
everyone uh that's uh that's on the

243
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,079
stream uh I'm going to search this link

244
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,720
which is

245
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,199
uh a new a new game that we are testing

246
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,600
and I'm excited to to share it with with

247
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,000
you uh it's the adventure of curiosity

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,800
and here Daniel I'm

249
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,199

link uh it would be awesome okay there's

251
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,399
a tiny typo on your slides it just ends

252
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,360
with a curiosity

253
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,160
okay thank you but I'm gonna I'm gonna

254

chat okay thank you uh yeah I told you

257
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm I'm a dyslexic I have all kind of

258
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,480
Tyles around my life sorry for that I

259
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,920
always try to improve it uh let's

260
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,639
um okay so you sure down yeah I put it

261
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,440
in the YouTube chat so people can head

262
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,000
over there all right yeah could you tell

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
us about this PL form and this is the

264
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
first active

265
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,440
game yes um we uh started thinking on

266
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,560
how to do a game a while ago and we

267
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,959
decided to

268
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,720
go with this

269
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,440
um uh picture that explains how it works

270
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,600
actually it's simple and you have uh

271
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,440
four pieces the internal States external

272
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,880
States and in the middle you have the

273
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,319
sensory State and the active state

274
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,240
so here is the mission you have some

275
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,720
instructions that uh you can read and

276
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,040
would be fun if you go through them and

277
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,959
you can go either way and here we are

278
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,920
going to go to the sensory state where

279
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,120
you're going to listen to a

280
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,880
music where some

281
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,759
notes you

282
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,880
can censor that are not in the famous

283
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,880
song of for

284
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,000
Elise

285
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,480
so you have to take

286
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,639
notes

287
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,839
and you can

288
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
go and you can see that we are on the

289
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,720
mark of blanket which so everything very

290
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
delini as Del would paint

291
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,959
it and here is your active uh part of

292
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,679
the game where you have to do something

293
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,880
which

294
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,960
is add the different notes

295
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
that your uh Professor

296
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,919
music Professor is telling you don't

297
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,880
miss because you probably on the

298
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,440
uh external uh state are trying to play

299
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,960
the music so you have to infer that you

300
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,600
are missing some

301
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
notes

302
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,400
and

303
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,159
go

304
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,360
to the active

305
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,400
State and start uh walking through the

306
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,720
right note uh if I miss the

307
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,400
note I just follow fall into the nothing

308
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,559
and come back it into my internal state

309
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,880
so uh probably would have to go back and

310
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,440
sensor

311
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,280
again and once I take the right actions

312
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,799
and the right notes I can go and solve

313
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,520
the puel and the idea here is to have a

314
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,960
tool gaming tool to um explain or so you

315
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
can uh

316
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
experience

317
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
how this uh active inference on free

318
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,480
energy

319
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,360
works and once

320
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,159
you go to the end

321
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,000
of that uh Adventure which I'm not going

322
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,280
to finish because it's something that

323
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,720
players should do you're gonna have a

324
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,960
door where you have to put the SE

325
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,600
sequence in low case of uh of what were

326
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,039
the missing notes and it's going to

327
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,320
allow you to come inside the treasure

328
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,840
room where

329
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,559
you will have uh

330
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,080
feedback

331
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,280
uh uh feedback that you can send us and

332
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,600
we will be very happy to have it and

333
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,159
then uh if you have a wallet you will be

334
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,600
able to have a digital asset if not we

335
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
will add information to help

336
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,159
uh people to go from Web Two to web 3

337
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,200
and to get those digital

338
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,360
assets and here to be developed would be

339
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,640
future Adventures that I would be very

340
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,679
happy

341
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
to

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,760
do so this was pretty much the

343
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,600
presentation and hopefully we have play

344
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,720
new players in the coming

345
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,760
days hope you have fun and I really

346
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,799
really encourage anyone to

347
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:43,159
discover and play with all these ideas

348
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,720
and thoughts and experiments

349
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,480
and things that I have the gut feeling

350
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,320
that are going to revolutionize how we

351
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,440
understand uh the world

352
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,320
and how we can improve in it by reducing

353
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,960
uncertainty so thank you and I don't

354
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,600
know Daniel if you have any comments or

355
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,159
something in this last 10 minutes oh

356
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
yeah let's we can definitely talk for a

357
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,440
few minutes I'm I'm seeing many fun

358
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,960
comments and questions in the chat so

359
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,400
people can can post it yeah the game

360
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
play is smoother on even a normal

361
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
computer Compu it just like it may look

362
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
choppy on the live stream but it's quite

363
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,600
a nice um playing experience like maybe

364
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,320
just a little context like how did you

365
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,080
get into building these worlds or what

366
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,320
kind of tools are these and we obviously

367
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,000
don't see them in today's mainstream

368
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
educational and research offerings but

369
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,320
like what could that even be to bring

370
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,600
together this kind of

371
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,640
immersion and role play playing with

372
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,440
education

373
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:11,200
research yes um I as uh um we I I I've

374
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,559
been playing rooll games and rooll games

375
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,960
uh you have uh very uh diverse kind of

376
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,320
players so I I was playing with uh guys

377
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,360
like me like uh

378
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,600
have

379
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,799
um had this struggle through the uh

380
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,960
school and guys that uh end up being uh

381
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
researchers like yourself because they

382
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,279
were very good and in those environments

383
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,400
and and and for me it it was like we are

384
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,840
sharing a lot of

385
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,679
cognitive uh um um values and

386
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,039
information and they are really having

387
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,720
fun with me so I the the what what the

388
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,159
Academia is telling me is not is is not

389
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,480
what I'm I'm I'm feeling in in the re in

390
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,520
in outside Academia so that that through

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
the

392
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,240
years uh it became more and more clear

393
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,360
that was one of uh the drivers to have a

394
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,440
very diverse kind of friends and

395
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,720
and and that one of the most important

396
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,960
things for me to learn it was having fun

397
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,960
and to be a good professional I have to

398
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,760
be enjoying what I'm doing and to enjoy

399
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,159
what I do it has to have that gamify

400
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,679
feeling of it and so in 2021 uh I I I

401
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,760
just went to sty to explore that road uh

402
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,159
because uh block chains what what can do

403
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,360
is have a persistent C of of objects and

404
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,600
attribute attributions to the those

405
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,360
objects and to those wallets that you

406
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,480
can add and build on top of them it's

407
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
like having a huge uh database for a

408
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,120
game purpose and and then you figure out

409
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,480
that a game is a kind of organization so

410
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,799
you need rules you need to serve values

411
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,760
you need to uh have like uh what we are

412
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,440
building now which is the cision Sho

413
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,120
which you agree with the players what's

414
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,080
going to be about and how it's going to

415
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,760
work and and we are uh uh building this

416
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,840
um fantastic uh storytelling of how uh

417
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,520
kind of world were it was in the

418
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,600
uh early 20s compared to what's

419
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,960
happening now in this uh imaginary world

420
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,799
that's complementary to what's happening

421
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,120
in real life and we are just exploring

422
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,799
those areas for three years and once I

423
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,559
got into

424
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,159
the into the Institute uh we started

425
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,679
sharing these ideas to uh send us to do

426
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,679
um system thinking curse that it was

427
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,720
super uh cool which uh we we explore and

428
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,240
learn and this uh document that I can

429
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,919
say it was very uh important for us to

430
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,440
understand and we uh find find out the

431
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,320
necessity to be able to Compu what we

432
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,600
are doing so we start focusing more on

433
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,440
ontology on on

434
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,520
on all the the briak breaks that you

435
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,760
need to to understand to build um the

436
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,320
skeleton of uh something that could last

437
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,919
for decades which is uh uh the idea and

438
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,960
we are trying to build it so everyone

439
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,760
can copy paste Fork it and do whatever

440
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,679
they want with the game adapt it to

441
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,799
their own organizations and use it uh on

442
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,840
their favor and and we are just

443
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,158
exploring and having

444
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,279
fun that's that's awesome and there's so

445
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
many um there's so many pieces there

446
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
it's true about the fun and the

447
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,559
Curiosity those intrinsic

448
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:50,760
motivations like being six hours deep

449
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,080
into counting ants in the desert or

450
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,000
5,000 pipet pushes deep or whatever it

451
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,320
is in the trenches and in The Last Mile

452
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,930
and

453
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,520
[Music]

454
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,559
um it it can be easy to lose

455
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,760
sight but when we lose sight and when we

456
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,279
put out the fire and the spark it's a

457
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,000
cold dark night and no career or status

458
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,720
or extrinsic valuation is going to

459
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,880
provide like simply the

460
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,480
joy and the the deeper meaning of

461
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,960
like two people going on a little

462
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,880
Adventure running around this space

463
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,159
being inside active inference rather

464
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,120
than active inference being like this

465
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,080
high-speed train that's leaving anyone

466
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,679
behind or you're on the outside and it's

467
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,039
taking these twists and turns and you're

468
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,559
you're getting thrown off it's like it

469
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,519
is cool and air conditioned in this

470
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,159
space and people play and watch a lot of

471
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,120
games where they

472
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,480
wield violent arms and not even like

473
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,279
saying whether that's good or bad it

474
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,159
just it is a genre to want to have a

475
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,320
camera either in a character's head

476
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,360
firstperson perspective or a camera in a

477
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
second or a third person perspective

478
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,159
which you can switch between here and

479
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,919
like those kinds of topics about like

480
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,760
egocentric versus allocentric navigation

481
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,120
and our ability to have a a perspective

482
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,600
swap on ourself and be able to take that

483
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
kind of like outof

484
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,360
body um situational awareness in real

485
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,640
spatial

486
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,000
settings and just to be able to cruise

487
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
through this space and it's like yeah

488
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,519
there's no there's no right way to

489
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,279
Boomerang from ex you could go from

490
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,480
external to sensory you could go here or

491
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,679
there it's it's a um it's an

492
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,799
appetizer and uh a fertilization that

493
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,399
like we've really just never

494
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,679
seen okay yeah thank you very much

495
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,440
Daniel for

496
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,760
this any last thoughts or

497
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,080
comments no just enjoy while we are here

498
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
which

499
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,519
is I think our

500
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,760
mission all right thank you Pablo I'm

501

sure everyone's going to really enjoy

502
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,399
this and let's also of course continue

503
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,919
to um develop these games and continue

504
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,080
to offer these on Rams and have times

505
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,760
where we're meeting up in these spaces

506
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,080
and playing

507
