8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,580
next up welcome avail

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,100
we have available

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,800
with embedded normativity so thanks aval

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,340
to you

12
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,540
hello can you hear me yep

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,420
and can you see the slides bomb I only

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,780
see the top left of the slide

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,360
you only see this the top left

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,980
yeah just yeah try again thank you

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,420
okay

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,780
Yep looks great thank you

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,520
okay good

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,980
so I am uh

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,619
I'm interested in multiscale Collective

22
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,380
organization this is why I came talks in

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,880
France to begin with

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,220
and the core question I've been asking

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,920
is um basically when we look at humans

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,900
organization there is great Evolution

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,600
there is a challenge through time of the

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,299
specific patterns that are enacted and

29
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,420
this is very hard to account for and I

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,280
have been trying to pin down more and

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,960
more specifically what exactly is going

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,020
on and how to model it so this specific

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,080
work is a work I wrote in the context of

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,420
what my PhD of course which is funded by

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,060
The Escape project a project in a

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,860
cognitive archeology that's interesting

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,939
interested sorry in how the culture the

38
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,280
archaeological landscape shape cognition

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,899
and vice versa the title of it is

40
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,399
normativity an active inference of

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,840
agency

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,479
an active inference account of agency BM

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,299
flash because you will see very quickly

44
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,320
why

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,659
so first we will go through the existing

46
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,360
work on ankle technician in the context

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,699
of active in France then we'll try to

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,800
expose the concept of embedding motivity

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
which we introduce here

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,180
and what it means and then we'll look at

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,819
the more semiotic question around the

52
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,980
externalization and utilization of

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,780
normativity in

54
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,700
cultural landscapes

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,340
so first encrypted coordination inactive

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,720
inference

57
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,300
so we interact in France I will go

58
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,400
quickly over it I still need to do it

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,739
because there are Lookers that are not

60
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,819
familiar

61
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,360
so active in front say that

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,720
agent continuously predicts the specific

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
queue sensory cues they will see and

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,900
they predict the action or policy they

65
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
will not take and they basically enact

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,260
uh an ongoing stream of expectation that

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,480
they reconstruct given you know a coming

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,800
signal

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,180
so this is best accounting for in this

70
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,340
schema which shows the agent as the

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,560
medical system which engage through

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,180
environment

73
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,120
through action and cessations and all of

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
this

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,480
um specific

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,900
domains they minimize a specific

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,900
function that is called free energy and

78
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,200
whose minimization basically means there

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,680
is a productive process going on

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,500
and a core property effective in France

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,319
is that it dissolves agency as we

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,180
typically understand it we don't have

83
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,819
agents that have like internal monologue

84
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,000
that drives them to take decision we

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,620
have a constitution dissipation of

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,500
what's going on and whatever an agent in

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,900
space itself to do it will do

88
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,959
and so this goes for

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,060
computationally satisfying but very

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,400
definitionary notion of what is going on

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,680
with agency

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,340
so the question then comes uh what is

93
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,440
the relation between an agent and the

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,400
cognitive landscape in which it evolves

95
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,400
uh I will present very rapidly again the

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,739
framework of skill and functionality if

97
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,220
you're nearby Bruno's

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,540
and which says that skill agents which

99
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,520
we understand as agents that understand

100
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,699
what is going on around them they will

101
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,580
basically experience the world as a

102
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,560
landscape of affordances which is

103
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,660
opportunities for actions

104
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,900
and they will their cognition pretty

105
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,639
much reduces to the experience of the

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,900
Sunscape and adaptive engagement with it

107
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,300
which basically maximize the grip the

108
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,320
agent as on the system

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,780
and essentially for reasons we will not

110
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,820
go over because it's math

111
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,940
the very uh existence experience of this

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,699
landscape it is equivalent to the

113
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,199
existence of constraints of our

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,419
attention the attention that the agent

115
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,080
gives to thing which uh translates the

116
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,540
emerald expectation that are at least

117
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,720
two times but the more expectation that

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,000
the agent enacts

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,160
and so this becomes very interesting

120
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,560
when we you know cross it with the

121
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,380
existence of encaturation in humans

122
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,320
because the basic experience we have of

123
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,820
affordances of what we can do it is uh

124
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,440
shapes culturalities shaped by social

125
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,440
interaction when we learn uh with other

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,680
humans about what we do what we can do

127
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,139
and what we can do and this means that

128
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,620
the basic human experience it's a

129
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,600
thoroughly encultured it's embedded in

130
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,639
what ROM said called a cultural

131
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,259
landscape landscape of cultural

132
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,759
affordances

133
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,000
and it is embedded in cultural and

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
material

135
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
[Music]

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,759
regimes of attention so ways to pay

137
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,500
attention to things

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,720
and this is a figure that comes I

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,020
believe from this year on

140
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,060
thinking throughout the minds where it

141
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,460
shows basically and how the actual

142
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,380
installation cycle when we have the

143
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,080
Civil agent they build a common

144
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,139
environment that has epistemic cues on

145
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,660
how the world is like and when we are

146
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,120
incarcerated to pay attention to things

147
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,819
in a certain manner that makes it so we

148
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,860
perceive and enact this this landscape

149
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,500
and so the uncultured constraint of all

150
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,660
the improve attention because of the

151
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,240
what we saw just before the deflationary

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,419
account of agency it means that the very

153
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,220
expensive landscape cultural landscape

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,560
that is collectively enacted it

155
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,139
effectively integrates intentionality

156
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,080
and it effectively integrates

157
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,400
normativity in a way that Clash is

158
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,000
strongly with classical account of both

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,620
so given this state of the art let us

160
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,840
look at what I mean specifically about

161
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,080
embedding normativity so a marine

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,360
motivity is a kind of formativity I

163
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,780
think you have you have got it

164
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,120
so normal activity it means basically

165
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,419
the criterions by which we judge things

166
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,979
to be good and bad

167
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,580
in the context of biological system they

168
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,400
will look for specific I don't know

169
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,099
chemical concentration and I will avoid

170
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,720
other this is the phenomena of

171
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,180
chemotaxis this is pretty basic and this

172
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,919
is a form of normativity

173
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,160
but for humans we will typically think

174
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,180
of you know laws cultural norms

175
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,280
um there's really shared way to judge

176
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,360
Behavior

177
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,180
and again at least in the context of

178
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,979
flow and choice Theory

179
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,900
it's because you think there is an agent

180
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,580
he has access to information and we'll

181
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,400
think what should I do and He will judge

182
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,460
uh rationally about what is good and

183
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,860
what is bad based on a collection of

184
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,080
values which are internal to the agent

185
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,380
this is not how it works

186
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,099
um

187
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,039
what I call embodied motivity is by

188
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,460
contrasts regimes of normal activity

189
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,979
where it is the uh the norms and value

190
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,800
that guide the agent's Behavior it is

191
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,479
embellished in the material and cultural

192
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,660
environment so basically the agent

193
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,160
projects a specific set of norms and

194
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,500
value in his very experienced princess

195
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,940
environment

196
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,479
and it will perceive the locus of

197
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,839
normativity as the environment and not

198
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,000
as a form of internal judgment

199
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,000
um

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
let us look at what can exactly how

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,640
amazing motivity work it will be more

202
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,839
concrete

203
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,019
so first we can materially constrain

204
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,779
people to do things so for example there

205
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,000
are roads you can go off-roads but it's

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,040
harder and you can't really do that if

207
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
you're a chariots so when you have a

208
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
specific pattern of roads which is

209
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,580
constructed by cities

210
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,440
uh you were pretty much constrained to

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,860
follow the roads materially and for this

212
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,920
we will talk of structural embedding

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,860
and there is another regimes of motivity

214
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,380
where we build on environment that will

215
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,500
basically queue you suggest you into uh

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,300
adopting specific norms and specific

217
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,320
values for example Escape

218
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,300
things that vertical patterns in

219
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
archaeological culture

220
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,740
they are somehow embedded within uh what

221
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,080
we call vertical Norms so hierarchy and

222
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,660
certification in Social relationship

223
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,540
and for this specific form of mudding we

224
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,580
control customers compelling

225
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm what is must be very clear is that

226
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,620
we don't have structural embedding on

227
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,360
one side and cementing embedding you

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,300
know there are basically two mechanism

229
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,640
complementary mechanism in which

230
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,560
normative sorry embedded multivity

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
occurs if we look at the city so this is

232
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,060
a

233
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,519
impression of Sumerian culture

234
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,500
city-states

235
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,260
we have a matter organization that

236
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,540
prompts specific kind of behavior so for

237
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,459
example we have a bridge and this bridge

238
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,279
allow you constrain you to go through

239
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,320
the river in a specific way if you are

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,279
on foot

241
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,060
but this particular constraints it is

242
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,220
perceivable so by using the bridge you

243
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,019
will also see that you can navigate the

244
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,760
world in this specific way

245
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,380
so you don't have aspiration between

246
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,360
semantic and structural embedding we

247
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,300
just have two ways in which

248
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,880
um constraints of our behavior that are

249
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,339
embedded in the environment work

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
and

251
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,459
something that is a core to the account

252
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,640
of Emily normativity is again that it is

253
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
not internal but we need to go into more

254
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,760
detail about what we mean by not being

255
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,920
internal because of course we're talking

256
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,140
about agency agents constrain what

257
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,079
agents do it's not outside

258
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,140
uh what it is is

259
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,800
um

260
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,660
and Marine motivity is a regime of the

261
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,140
motivity where the norms and value they

262
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,600
stem from the experience of foreigns for

263
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,500
example if I see a fire I will not think

264
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
about

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,940
hey could I put my hand in it and get my

266
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,220
hand burn

267
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,600
I think it will be painful I won't do

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,440
that

269
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,839
if I even think about putting my hand in

270
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,200
the fire I will immediately feel bad the

271
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,820
normativity it's embedded in my

272
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,800
experience of the world

273
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,459
I feel like the fire or more

274
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,380
specifically the possibility of putting

275
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,019
my hand in the fire is intrinsically

276
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,880
balanced I do not feel there is a

277
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,640
possibility that is neutral and then I

278
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,380
judge it to be bad

279
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,640
but uh of course this uh this judgment

280
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,760
does not occur outside even if I feel

281
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,000
like it's about my references it emerges

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,040
from the argument I have with the

283
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,500
material and cultural niche in which I

284
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,060
find myself

285
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
and if we want to

286
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,540
um

287
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,000
to untangle what this mean precisely you

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,100
will have to go into more detail into

289
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,760
the what I call the externalization

290
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,500
internalization of anonymatility

291
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,079
so let us look at something very simple

292
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,399
how normativity work for embodied agents

293
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,459
celebrate agents they do ceilings with

294
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,360
hopefully in a niche that is material

295
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,860
and this Niche will be marked by the

296
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,980
activity of my agent and these marks

297
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,320
they can then act as constraints either

298
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,180
through structural augmentating

299
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,579
embedding in the age environment because

300
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,040
like basically signify that in the past

301
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,079
I wanted to do that maybe doing that is

302
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,519
you know good

303
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,279
for example uh we have Centuries with I

304
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,899
don't know if century is a English word

305
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,019
but we have path if uh animals that have

306
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,500
legs this is actually important work uh

307
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,200
sorry work on a specific path they will

308
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,720
compact the Earth and it will become

309
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,019
improper to grow anything even grass and

310
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,300
you will have a path that will emerge

311
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,820
that are pretty it's pretty visible and

312
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,459
I'll tell you hey not only this Earth is

313
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,220
Compact and allow you to walk on its

314
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,100
like without effort but also this has

315
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,800
been widely judged to be um

316
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,880
to be a Goods uh

317
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,639
Outlook outline for navigation in this

318
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,079
specific environment

319
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,680
so the very experience of a bath

320
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,899
basically invites you it affords you

321
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,639
perceive the affordance of working

322
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,380
through the path

323
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,420
and this is something that again can

324
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,399
result from your own activity that can

325
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,959
be returned into the amendment by your

326
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
own activity

327
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
and solve this begs the question of how

328
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,000
okay there exists embedded normativity

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,519
but how do we embed normativity what is

330
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,300
the activity of embedding motivity like

331
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,339
and the word I will use for that is

332
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,100
externalization we perceive the world

333
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,560
because we externalize uh specific

334
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,440
causes of sensation into an imagined

335
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
objectives on the world

336
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,880
so when we see the path

337
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,000
we see a path we do not see compact

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,959
Earth that we then compute to mean that

339
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,240
other things have worked on it we just

340
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
see hey there is a path

341
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,320
and this is because we have externalized

342
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,260
a specific cognitive kind which is the

343
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,760
path

344
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
and this is a argument that

345
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,000
seropital Mains here are Lena in

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,040
steinler which if I remember well

347
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,880
um worked on the um the production of

348
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,120
devices that help blind people see

349
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,160
things through

350
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,920
I believe an array of Repertory device

351
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,540
on their shoulder so the core

352
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,699
argument they make is that if you give

353
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,380
people that they will start seeing

354
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,779
things they will start pursuing things

355
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,720
as being before them rather than having

356
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Liberation on the shoulder and then

357
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,500
thinking about oh what does it mean and

358
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,380
so the basic argument is that perception

359
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,899
is just

360
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,560
um picture of what cause we infer what

361
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,160
is the structure we infer of environment

362
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,240
given the existence of a specific

363
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,399
coupling device that relates action to

364
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,040
sensation and vice versa

365
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,519
and this critically relies on the

366
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,760
internalization of specific we could say

367
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,260
a lot of things that I will say priors

368
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,600
specific prior is not an interception

369
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,139
so missing the path as a path relies on

370
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,899
me having the prior knowledge that there

371
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,420
is such a thing as past and I should be

372
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,880
expecting to see them around

373
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,199
and so you have um duality of

374
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,180
externalization and internalization in

375
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,339
the production of a marine motivity I

376
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,839
can only see Norms out there if I've

377
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,980
internalized integrated or specific

378
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,920
apparatus of perception that entails

379
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,019
that they are indeed those specific

380
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,060
Norms that are embedded in those

381
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,459
specific references

382
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,579
and so this uh produce a marginal

383
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,740
question of symmetics basically of

384
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,240
information Theory

385
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
how do reading and writing motivity

386
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,000
works

387
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,300
uh so one extent lies I treat the world

388
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,160
as having specific natural categories

389
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,079
that I pretty much imagine

390
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,060
and I can use them because I can adjust

391
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,820
them as an extended memory that allow me

392
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,540
to read and write normative cues uh this

393
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,019
can be um you know letters uh pure signs

394
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,540
but as far as I'm concerned here all

395
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,459
signs are at least implicitly narrative

396
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,500
there about how you should interpret the

397
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,720
design

398
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,260
and this means that we can experience a

399
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,980
specific landscape or forenses and we

400
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,059
can

401
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,819
we can write things out there we can

402
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,280
write formative cues biobehavioral that

403
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,619
will then constrain further Behavior but

404
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,579
nothing tells us that we can

405
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,500
that we can

406
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,660
communicate with this the communication

407
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,240
it works because of the internalization

408
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,460
of prayers if a given community of

409
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,500
agents are initialized a specific set of

410
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,440
priors that is a set of pairs that

411
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
enable externalization of the narrative

412
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,360
cues then only it can use the

413
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,480
environments as a way to

414
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,280
two rights and reads normative cues as a

415
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,799
embedding normativity thing

416
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,039
and this communication it can be read in

417
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,780
terms of information theory of course

418
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,700
can you write in terms of semantics but

419
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,419
what is uh critical to analyze that the

420
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,820
process of internalization it is there

421
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,660
there is no um trust system there is no

422
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,640
private key that allows you to be sure

423
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,940
that the way you utilize Norms is very

424
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,780
specifically uh the way in which the

425
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,880
amylene Nativity was encouraged to begin

426
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,100
with there is a loss or there is

427
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,220
ambiguity or there is I'd rather say it

428
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,679
like this an active damage of

429
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,919
reconstruction of given priors by the

430
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,460
agents and so this gap between the

431
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,039
intent of other communicants and my

432
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,340
intents my understanding of what I meant

433
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,559
by their active engagement active

434
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,020
engagement with the world it builds a

435
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,360
tiny Gap in information that is somehow

436
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,340
enough to drive the opinion evolution of

437
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,919
cultural landscape and this is something

438
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,200
that I do not think is a marriage

439
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,419
inactive in France and I think is of

440
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,820
major interest to research

441
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,440
to the research at least in the

442
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
evolution of open-end evolution of

443
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,980
crucial landscape

444
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,280
so uh to sum up things

445
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,340
uh I just presented the paper that is

446
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,260
called animismativity and that speaks

447
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,480
and surprisingly enough of embedded

448
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,980
normativity

449
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,799
uh first major point is that effective

450
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,380
inference is correct then

451
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,320
um our notion of agencies dissolved

452
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,780
essentially in the notion that we can

453
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,160
perceive and enact cognitive landscape

454
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,740
if you want

455
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,760
and given that this is the case

456
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,160
we will experience the norms and value

457
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,799
that guy or behavior as a property of

458
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,120
you know the cognitive landscape

459
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,580
experience the affordance that we can

460
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,720
perceive

461
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,679
and these specific regime of normativity

462
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,039
I call embedded normativity

463
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,919
and the third thing is that you have a

464
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,220
critical thing going on any other

465
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,860
symmetically constraining thing going on

466
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,900
in the externalization internalization

467
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,960
of regimes of embelline nativity

468
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,480
because those two things they

469
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
respectively enable Nomad interactivity

470
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,059
to exist to have causal power

471
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,640
and the enable also the operating

472
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,679
evolution of the Norms that are embedded

473
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,840
in a given landscape in a given measure

474
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,179
landscape and therefore the operating

475
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,000
evolution of the excited cultural or

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,860
cognitive landscape

477
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,660
so thank you I will uh enroll my

478
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,520
references slides in case someone has

479
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,440
the really needs to know what the

480
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,480
reference season is ready to move around

481
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,340
the video for this

482
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,700
and do you have questions

483
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,799
awesome thank you avail

484
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,539
while people are typing any questions

485
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,360
could you maybe just give a little

486
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,640
introduction to the active inference for

487
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,039
the social sciences course like what

488
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,500
brought you to want to

489
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,080
facilitate this effort and where are we

490
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
at and where do you want it to go what

491
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,840
do you want it to be for people

492
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,480
unmute and then continue

493
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,679
good point thank you uh the activity for

494
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,780
institute organizes uh and keros

495
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,020
research organize a course on the on

496
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,700
active inference in the social science

497
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,179
that is essentially in explaining the um

498
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,940
and the consequences of the cultural

499
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,159
landscape formalism that I

500
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,880
hinted at slightly in this presentation

501
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,640
the goal of the course is to give a

502
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,860
basic ontology that is on the interface

503
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,140
between complexity science let us say

504
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,700
physics written large

505
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,919
cognitive Science Central science to

506
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,200
afford interdisciplinary collaboration

507
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,419
in the

508
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,640
in the social science and in the study

509
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,860
of the evolution of human societies

510
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,080
and I think it is cool

511
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
but then I asked because I have a nice

512
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,100
date some maybe you should ask Daniel

513
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,340
which is absolutely embiased whether the

514
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,140
course is cool

515
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,140
I I've been enjoying it a lot uh we just

516
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,360
finished last week with my section on

517
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,100
Collective Behavior

518
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,840
first we had the introduction lecture

519
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
from you then Ben White on the basics of

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,760
being an active agent and we have Lorena

521
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,520
and Mao's sections upcoming as well as

522
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,500
your more dedicated session yeah it's

523
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,940
been a really

524
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,799
fun uh

525
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,419
uh experience and it's going to provide

526
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,880
a really useful

527
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,740
missing piece

528
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,260
in the ecosystem I guess just one

529
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,620
question I have how do we take some of

530
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,840
these

531
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,940
topics you're bringing in about the

532
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,919
embedded normativities and think about

533
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,700
them digitally like are we talking about

534
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,799
conceptual embeddedness in information

535
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,039
environments and or are we talking about

536
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,039
the ergonomics of sitting at our desk or

537
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,860
how do we bring that kind of pleasure

538
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,200
path

539
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,360
stigmergy on the grounds

540
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,220
into the digital are we talking about

541
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,659
something that's

542
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,419
embodied and embedded

543
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,539
in the information space or are we still

544
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,799
talking about bodies

545
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,539
we talk about bodies with the brain

546
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,220
needs that do things in Virtual

547
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,919
environments but your question is I'm

548
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,200
not sure on the studies how can we bring

549
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,720
these specific Concepts in the study of

550
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,679
digital film Twitter internets

551
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,820
yeah is that it yeah okay

552
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,100
the whole study on the affordances you

553
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,000
have a

554
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,820
so the recipient of design has

555
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,799
incorporated a while ago the national

556
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,640
performance in its structure and most of

557
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,440
the study in the digital design center

558
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,860
or what uh platforms are for or do not

559
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,000
afford

560
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,419
and you have a richer stance when you

561
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,280
take into account not what you can do

562
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,640
with a specific interface but what the

563
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,400
specific interface invites you to do

564
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,580
given a set of cultural

565
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,120
written knowledge it can be self

566
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,880
learning but given a set of power that

567
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,780
you share with

568
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,400
with the um

569
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,640
platform in a way that is a

570
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,460
formal but indirect

571
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,900
and

572
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,220
um

573
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,580
so yes I would look at it in terms of in

574
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,360
user interface design I think this

575
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,840
concept specifically is useful for

576
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,559
um

577
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,140
for interface design

578
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,240
then you will have implicitly the

579
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,080
question of the floor that platforms

580
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,980
such as I don't know Twitter Facebook

581
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,900
how specific structural environment

582
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,960
brings specific Collective dynamics that

583
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,020
might be a bit richer

584
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,179
not ritual specifically but that might

585
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,100
go in a direction that the usant face

586
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,919
question do not go into

587
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,500
and that can still be modeled in terms

588
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,440
of constraints and therefore in terms of

589
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,400
embed normativity is that on point we'll

590
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,260
go to a question

591
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,379
um

592
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,820
yeah that's interesting about

593
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,659
what the interface does and then what it

594
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,260
invites it might invite things

595
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,240
in order for that invitation to be

596
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,940
fulfilled it has to actually provide

597
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,679
that possibility

598
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,539
but it might invite things that that

599
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,840
aren't relationally possible like there

600
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,140
might be a wall which invites climbing

601
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,360
to a given Observer yet they cannot

602
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,140
climb it and then on the other side

603
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,760
is

604
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,900
a capacity that isn't invited and

605
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,240
that is the

606
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,140
the adjacent possible of tool use

607
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,120
where something that was being used for

608
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,159
this purpose it's like all of a sudden

609
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,600
it just fell out of someone's hand they

610
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,480
grasped it a different way it invited a

611
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,980
different engagement and then that can

612
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,840
become re-entrenched and that points to

613
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,360
that sequential like making and breaking

614
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,880
of new spaces that your work has

615
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,520
featured over the last few years

616
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,380
yeah exactly this work has been

617
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,500
developed with uh while thinking about

618
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,480
tool use while thinking about the

619
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,860
cognitive archeology we're thinking

620
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,220
about the experience of cities the way

621
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,340
urbanism from specific behavior

622
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,840
but

623
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,400
um if I can get back on the internet

624
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,220
thing I'd like to make it more specific

625
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,620
so the interface design as far as I know

626
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,100
is focused on interface what is it that

627
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,020
is not surprising

628
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,539
but in doing so it is focused on

629
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,900
specific Forums on what you can do you

630
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,240
have another layer in uh ecological

631
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,340
psychology which is the layer of

632
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,500
solicitation so for example on Twitter

633
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,100
there's something very specific which is

634
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,860
when you log in it shows you it shows

635
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,299
you the number of authentication you

636
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,240
have then it removes it and you have to

637
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
wait to know which were those

638
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,159
sanctification and you have to wait no

639
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,919
once again not one minute but a random

640
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,980
amount of time so this is uh what they

641
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,740
call dark patterns they are patterns in

642
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,039
design that are explicitly designed to

643
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,260
create addiction so this is a layer you

644
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,380
can't afford in reference because

645
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,419
yeah from a foreign

646
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,900
motivation and the way uh specific

647
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,419
structural environment is perceived the

648
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,779
cinematics semantics Maybe

649
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,240
the meaning that given landscape has for

650
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,520
an agent and even if you look at this

651
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,679
you are still still looking at the

652
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,900
platform in a way that is um

653
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,620
is embedded from these specific patterns

654
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,600
that specific patterns of things that

655
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,820
people do on the platform if you have

656
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,320
Twitter without the aggressive

657
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,080
Securities and the um why to

658
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,360
aggressively signal that you are in

659
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,220
whatever it is is going on you don't

660
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,980
have Twitter much of Mastodon maybe

661
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,100
that's us very similar affordances and

662
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,640
very very very dissimilar solicitation

663
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,700
so this is this is why you have to to

664
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,799
take a multi-scale account of things and

665
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,240
when you take them it's kind of kind of

666
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,340
things you have to look at the semiotics

667
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,380
particular Behavior how specific

668
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,200
coordination occur at specific scales

669
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,559
around specific communication specific

670
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,240
message passing

671
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,900
and once you look at how specific

672
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,760
message become meaningful to specific

673
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,260
agent you are

674
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,419
you you have a problem basically because

675
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,340
this is subjectively this is constructed

676
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,720
through the activity of the agent and

677
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,240
this is uh whatever is the

678
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,980
range of time you are looking at you

679
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,240
will have the construction of new

680
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,580
possibilities of adjacent possible as

681
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,200
you put it

682
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,580
and yeah this is the this is the uh big

683
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,220
question that I think we are missing at

684
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,399
