1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,430
Right.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,790
All right.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,140
For the next interval,

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,216
we are in the section hosted

5
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:30,084
by the Active Inference Institute on our

6
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:32,016
recent paper, active Inference Institute

7
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:34,916
and the Active Inference Ecosystem. So

8
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:38,252
two short messages. First,

9
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:41,388
if you're in the live chat, I'll post

10
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,556
the link right now to the paper. And

11
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:46,236
this can be more of like a

12
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,756
conversational interval. So if you have

13
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:53,344
any questions about the

14
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:56,976
ecosystem or the institute or any

15
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:59,520
of the stuff that we're talking about,

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,336
let's make it a conversation. And then

17
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:04,164
second message. If there are any co

18
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:06,896
authors on this paper who are listening

19
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:10,580
to this stream, then message

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,264
me on discord or post in the YouTube

21
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,564
live chat or just check your calendar,

22
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:20,010
and I expect some others to join in

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,520
as we go. Welcome,

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,408
Pablo. We'll be hearing in a

25
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:31,864
little bit from you as a presenter.

26
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,060
Is there anything that you want to just

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,052
bring up or reflect on before I share

28
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,148
the screen with the paper and we just

29
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:41,344
walk through it, explore it and hear

30
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:41,970
questions?

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,350
It okay.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,144
I'll bring in the paper. And again,

33
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:10,824
anyone watching live, please just feel

34
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,656
free to write any questions,

35
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:17,144
and I'm just going to bring

36
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,648
it so that Pablo. You're not going to

37
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:22,468
see the paper, but it's

38
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:23,720
on the live stream.

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,610
All right,

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,850
cool.

41
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,560
Well, here we go. This is a paper

42
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,266
that had an awesome co

43
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:49,246
authorship and even broader circles

44
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:52,146
beyond the listed co authors of

45
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,226
collaboration and contribution. So just

46
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:57,154
like everything that has happened and

47
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,940
will happen in our work,

48
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,390
it was massively participatory and

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,398
a real learning by doing and a real

50
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,480
enactment moment.

51
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,154
The first version was released three

52
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:17,126
days ago on Saturday, August 19,

53
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,178
and I'll briefly just list all the

54
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:22,282
authors. First, we had the institute as

55
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,586
the first author so that the citation

56
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:29,662
can always remain like institute et al.

57
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:32,554
Institute, comma active Inference

58
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:35,482
institute. And we also had Andrea Guire,

59
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,902
John Boyk, Lieber Burian, matthew Brown,

60
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,194
RJ Corday, scott David david S.

61
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:42,782
Douglas, Pablo Fernandez Macchia,

62
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,198
Daniel Friedman, holly Grimm, Avele

63
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,174
Gwynen, carlo Maria, Louisa Ayenico,

64
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:50,146
virginia Blue Knight, alexandra

65
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:53,026
Mikhailova, Ali Ramju Adil Razi, jacob

66
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:56,166
Smith, rene Tamari, dean Tickles and

67
00:03:56,188 --> 00:04:00,118
Alex Viakin. So this includes everyone

68
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:02,666
from founders and officers and board of

69
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,194
directors and formal participants on

70
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:06,662
different projects and different roles

71
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,794
as volunteers or facilitators or

72
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,242
interns, and also people who are

73
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:14,282
continuing to join the fun and show up

74
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:18,126
and makes the institute in our field

75
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,286
what it is and what it can be, what we

76
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,280
want it to be.

77
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,206
There's a table of contents for those

78
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,134
who like to click through. And just

79
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:30,846
broadly, there's going to be a preamble

80
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:32,626
on active inference. But outside of the

81
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,422
preamble, this paper is not conceptual,

82
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,282
it is not technical, it is not

83
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,766
philosophical, although perhaps it can

84
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,618
be read in all of those ways, but it's

85
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:44,870
quite a logistical, historical,

86
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,150
and vision oriented position document.

87
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,186
After getting some of the active

88
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:55,066
inferences out of the way in the

89
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,146
preamble. We're going to turn to the

90
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:59,318
institute itself in terms of our vision,

91
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,722
values, principles, and how we see

92
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:04,358
moving through the challenges that we're

93
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,750
facing right now onto the specific

94
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,862
history of the institute, our current

95
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,222
organization model in terms of our

96
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,046
governance and leadership structure, as

97
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:17,746
well as the institute units, the

98
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,826
organizational units that support all

99
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,090
the work we do. We then turn out

100
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,326
to the community and ecosystem growth

101
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,786
and development and go through some

102
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:33,042
details of different roles that

103
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:35,446
our stakeholders and participants in our

104
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,382
space and some of the tools that we use

105
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,814
today for managing information and

106
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:42,374
message passing. We talk a little bit

107
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:44,590
about our communications plan, internal

108
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,730
and external, both sides of the blanket,

109
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,898
and point towards some of the types of

110
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:51,034
support, infrastructure and

111
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:53,034
administration that we do and that we

112
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:54,906
will offer for the active inference

113
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,502
ecosystem. We frame that in terms of

114
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,322
continual deployment, continual

115
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:01,486
development and quality, performance and

116
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,274
growth evaluations across multiple

117
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,286
scales, close with some discussion and

118
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:09,650
then provide an appendix that overviews

119
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,146
a variety of the open source services

120
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,466
that the Institute has provided over the

121
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:17,998
past. So let's just jump in. I'm

122
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,442
actually going to jump into the open

123
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,926
source services first and overview them

124
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,438
before we jump back up to the top and

125
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:27,126
look at the big picture. Because this is

126
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:29,382
really to appreciate the work of so many

127
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,518
contributors who stepped up in

128
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,822
the uncanny valley, in the gray zone,

129
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,354
in the ecosystem, as it's forming, as

130
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:39,626
it's always forming, and really made it

131
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,674
happen. And so many people we know are

132
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,700
out there scribbling or taking notes or

133
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,930
printing out papers by Friston at all or

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,786
struggling and asking questions, are

135
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,214
there applications of this? How would

136
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:53,166
this matter? Why would this matter? Is

137
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,798
there a code version of this? How do you

138
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,254
connect the dots between these? Like,

139
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,226
those are what we ask every day. And so

140
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:01,346
when people can combine their regimes of

141
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,014
attention into a synthetic intelligence

142
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:06,594
outcome, then we go so far.

143
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:10,626
So the first category of works that the

144
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,786
Institute has developed are educational.

145
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:15,206
We've done video live streams since the

146
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,118
end of 2020. Till now, more than 370

147
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,560
live streams. All live streams are

148
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,686
curated in terms of their transcript.

149
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,958
And we increasingly are developing

150
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:30,858
automated and semiautomated methods for

151
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:32,922
transcription, translation, sub,

152
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:36,140
captioning, language modeling and so on.

153
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,702
We've had textbook groups actually.

154
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:41,226
Now, as of now, we have three completed

155
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:42,954
cohorts of the active inference textbook

156
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,390
group, the 2022 textbook.

157
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,334
We have two courses that are being

158
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,606
offered that are produced by external

159
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,626
content developers, and both of these

160
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,274
have only started in the last three,

161
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:56,606
four months. First is Chris Fields's,

162
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,754
physics is Information Processing, and

163
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,870
second is the work spearheaded by Avel

164
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,278
and co organized with Kairos Research,

165
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,162
active inference in the social sciences.

166
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:07,814
Both of these are like awesome and great

167
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:10,422
learning experiences, as we heard from

168
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,906
earlier in the symposium. We're working

169
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:15,814
with Sanjeev Namjoshi on his incredible

170
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,946
textbook, although almost to call it a

171
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:22,134
textbook is to either think more broadly

172
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,106
about textbooks than one has or

173
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,866
constrain what it really is that he's

174
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,990
doing, because it's such a unique, real

175
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,546
research development, full spectrum

176
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,710
effort. So I'm really looking forward to

177
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,880
seeing how this plays out in 2024.

178
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,106
Until then, for those who want to get

179
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:42,066
involved with the testing that we do and

180
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,774
we've developed the Active Inference

181
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,814
Ontology, which is a critical resource

182
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,554
for the ecosystem. It enables us to

183
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:51,606
center accessibility, rigor and

184
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,686
applicability across languages and

185
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,246
settings by knowing what it is that

186
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,734
we're talking about when we talk about

187
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,742
active inference. On the research side,

188
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,778
we've also developed the Ontology in a

189
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:05,258
research direction in terms of research

190
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,734
on and about and with active inference

191
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:11,114
itself. As far as software goes, our

192
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:13,226
primary development, first off, has been

193
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,270
the documentation and connecting the

194
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,542
dots around some of these other

195
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,286
incredible packages that others are

196
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,734
developing. For example, just in this

197
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,278
symposium, we've heard from some of the

198
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:26,506
core developers and open source

199
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,814
contributors to Pymdp, the Python

200
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,754
package for generative modeling, as well

201
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,138
as just a couple of minutes ago from

202
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:36,162
Bert de Fryes and Dmitry Bagueev coming

203
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:40,322
from the Julia language RX and FIR side.

204
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:41,506
And both of those are some of the

205
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:43,166
leading packages for applying active

206
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:44,774
inference. So we do a lot of work to

207
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:46,134
connect those dots and make it more

208
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,470
accessible. Not everybody is going to

209
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,626
jump in with all 6ft to a programming

210
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,358
language. And what we've done with

211
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:54,266
Active Blockfriends, with the work of

212
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:57,638
Jacob Smekal and others, is to wrap

213
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,654
generative models from active inference

214
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,086
inside of the complex systems modeling

215
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,454
framework Catcat. We've developed

216
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,526
notation interoperability systems that

217
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:09,262
actually let us pull back one layer from

218
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,310
the implementational details themselves,

219
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,522
for example, of RX infer or of Pymdp,

220
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,126
so that we can bring it halfway to

221
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,110
where the ontology and the visualization

222
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,826
and the natural language exists, and

223
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,426
then use language models and other

224
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,266
techniques to deploy it in an

225
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:27,966
implementation fashion. We've developed

226
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:30,934
a host of research publications. We

227
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,510
support people in all of their different

228
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,726
stages of their career, different

229
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,774
seasons of life, and some really

230
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:42,658
creative work has been directly produced

231
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:46,010
through an institute project or somebody

232
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,426
who knows may have gotten good ideas or

233
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,962
good feedback just by hanging out,

234
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,134
being in the game. And we performed

235
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:55,222
literature metaanalyses to help grapple

236
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,006
with the scope and the quantity and the

237
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:00,142
quality of what is unfolding before our

238
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:02,862
eyes or before our antenna. Again, even

239
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,662
as we only so partially sample this

240
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:09,234
ocean of information, we're active in

241
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:12,338
standard setting and continue to develop

242
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,478
our qualification standards for active

243
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:15,954
inference that could be the basis of

244
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,822
education, research and professional

245
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,094
development. We provide a variety of

246
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,542
mentorship and facilitation service type

247
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,310
activities, including volunteer program,

248
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,866
internship program, distributed

249
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:31,026
facilitation, and applied active

250
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,554
inference symposia. These activities,

251
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:35,286
just as all others that we're describing

252
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:37,434
above, are open source, and they're also

253
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:40,220
open to your participation. So if you

254
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,354
can follow some of those suggestions by

255
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,394
JF time boxing and prioritize and pay

256
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,494
attention and be active, all those fun

257
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,254
things that he said, and you're looking

258
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,038
to do it in a semi structured way with a

259
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,326
volunteer program, or in a more

260
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,478
structured way with the internship,

261
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:00,162
then I heartily encourage people to get

262
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:03,506
involved. Act now. And in

263
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:06,946
terms of governance activity, we have

264
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:09,890
a scientific advisory board as well as a

265
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,086
board of directors. And together with

266
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:15,122
the officers, those groups constitute

267
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,598
the formal governance structure of the

268
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:18,982
Institute. But there's also so much more

269
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,742
to it, and we look forward to

270
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,678
understanding what ecosystem governance

271
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,402
can look like in the coming years. So

272
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,314
welcome, Dean. I just summarized the

273
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:32,310
work itself. That was the preamble.

274
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,306
And now if you'd like to say hi, you or

275
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,686
Pablo, before we jump into more sections

276
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,182
of the paper or look at more questions

277
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,406
that people have asked, how goes it? Or

278
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,486
what was your experience of working with

279
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:46,800
the paper? Or what brings you onto this

280
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,420
strange stream at this opportune time?

281
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,706
Basically why I'm here is because for

282
00:12:56,728 --> 00:13:00,050
the first time, even as an acting

283
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,382
board member with the Institute, I was

284
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:06,502
able to get a better sense of

285
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:10,840
the kind of depth that we aspire to.

286
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,500
And I'm not sure whether or not we

287
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,786
are going to be I really don't know what

288
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,146
directions we're going to be going in

289
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,490
the next coming months, weeks, years,

290
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,230
et cetera. But I have a better sense

291
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,454
now, as a result of participating in

292
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,870
this development exercise,

293
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,862
of what the potential is than I probably

294
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,478
had at any time. And I've been with the

295
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:37,886
Active Inference Institute for a couple

296
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:41,106
of years, so that's saying something. I

297
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,618
think we had to get to this point to be

298
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,706
able to write this document, and now

299
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,486
it's acting as a bit of a springboard

300
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:52,438
now which way we go and how we land.

301
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,566
I'm not still certain about what that

302
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:56,534
looks like, but I think that's part of

303
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:59,480
what the really interesting thing is.

304
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,506
We seem to have moved away from the

305
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:06,166
dock, and now the real journey begins.

306
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,380
So that's my take on it so far.

307
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,294
Moving away from the dock, dock pushing

308
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:17,066
off, using it as a springboard,

309
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,926
continuing the adventure, leaving the

310
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:21,530
preprint behind, continuing to version

311
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,910
it as a living document and also

312
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,110
wayfinding outside of the doc. Pablo.

313
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,270
Oh, wait, I don't hear you yet. Pablo.

314
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,846
Sorry, I was mute. Hello. It was

315
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,574
a great experience to go through the

316
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:49,190
document and review it and reread it and

317
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,718
thinking about it. Actually, it's a

318
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,702
living document, which is super

319
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:57,750
exciting, and I keep taking notes and

320
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,286
hopefully act on it in the

321
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:04,758
future. And it's been

322
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:10,720
a super experience to find

323
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,318
so many people with the same interest,

324
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,082
same interest and some

325
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:25,826
values that I really think are going

326
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:29,026
to be the basis of organizations on the

327
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,234
future. So I think we are doing

328
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:32,760
something very cool here.

329
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,934
Cool. All right, well, let's just walk

330
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:41,494
through some of the sections in the 25

331
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:45,242
minutes that we have. Again, the paper

332
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,606
is being shown on the stream, but Dean

333
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:51,420
And probably don't see it. So we

334
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,538
kicked off with a preamble. We wanted to

335
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:59,086
introduce active inference as briefly as

336
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:02,542
we could and point towards the

337
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,274
fundamental first principles and physics

338
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:08,942
based nature of active inference and

339
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,734
initially point towards its integrative

340
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,138
capacity in principle. And then in the

341
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:16,274
second paragraph, there's about 104

342
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:20,286
citations in this paragraph. And that's

343
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,262
where it's really only a sampling of

344
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,160
the domains, 21 domains here.

345
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,558
So it's a place where we can point to

346
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,506
where is active inference being applied,

347
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,046
or how is active inference being

348
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,014
applied, or how is it different or

349
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,962
better than another approach in a given

350
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:40,826
setting? Which isn't to say that it does

351
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,634
everything in all settings for all

352
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,330
people at all times and all of that,

353
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,262
but this is to say that here's where one

354
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:50,990
can look to find out more and even just

355
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,006
building. This and bringing it all

356
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,706
together. We see so many opportunities

357
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:59,574
for epistemic resources in the ecosystem

358
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,774
and having real time literature analyses

359
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,906
and all these kinds of services that we

360
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:04,820
want to provide.

361
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,042
Starting on page five, we turn to the

362
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,694
institute itself and we

363
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:17,378
write as of August 2023, the Active

364
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,026
Inference Institute is a registered

365
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:21,462
nonprofit organization tasked with

366
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,186
identifying, establishing, and managing

367
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,340
the sustainable implementation of

368
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,910
administrative and governance functions

369
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,366
to give components of the active

370
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,434
inference ecosystem coherent forms and

371
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,398
reliable channels of communication.

372
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,926
Two, publishing and licensing protocols

373
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,798
that establish open and fair use and

374
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,678
effective dissemination of community

375
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,166
products within and beyond the

376
00:17:41,188 --> 00:17:44,426
ecosystem. Three, services at the scale

377
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,270
of individual humans and the community

378
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,810
at large so that stability is protected

379
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,974
while risk and uncertainty are minimized

380
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:53,666
within the ecosystem. And four,

381
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:56,658
organization and operation of cyber and

382
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:58,734
cognitive security systems that ensure

383
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:01,230
productivity, inclusivity accessibility,

384
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,046
and safety in discourse. In

385
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:06,374
collaboration, figure one gives

386
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:11,240
a graphical representation, just one of

387
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,430
how we are now. And for those who

388
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,362
want to dig more, check out the 2022

389
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,694
Active Inference textbook where you'll

390
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,834
also find a golden ring. And we kind of

391
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:27,166
took that graphical motif and ran with

392
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,134
it. Had a lot of fun and a lot of

393
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:32,446
interpretations there. So just here

394
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:35,546
looking at figure one, Dean or Pablo

395
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,200
just want to add anything?

396
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,140
Yeah, Dean.

397
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,980
So one thing about the building

398
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,416
of this document with a whole bunch

399
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:52,380
of authors,

400
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,016
it's often not made explicit,

401
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:00,340
but there are two aspects to learning

402
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,184
about yourself. One is to actually throw

403
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:06,544
some stuff down on paper because you

404
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,904
believe certain things need to be

405
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,944
included. And then the second part is

406
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:14,744
the consolidation process. And I think

407
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:15,784
one of the most interesting

408
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:18,520
consolidation processes was this

409
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,820
graphic, because I think what it does is

410
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,004
it tries to condense as

411
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,688
much as possible and yet still remain

412
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:31,396
coherent around what the relational

413
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:34,850
aspects that we are trying to

414
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,736
make available are, as opposed to, this

415
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:42,224
is what we've captured. Now look

416
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:44,610
what our graphic designer came up with.

417
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,396
So if you've had a chance to kind of

418
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:50,932
look at this and really analyze it and

419
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:53,940
think about the layers and think about,

420
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,336
okay, so what's the background here?

421
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,840
What's the foreground? Does this

422
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,880
representation allow for a swapping?

423
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,504
Can we have things that appear to be

424
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:07,812
background or fundamental basis

425
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,308
stuff that could actually be things that

426
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,872
we are addressing in the moment versus

427
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,052
those things which we look at as

428
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:16,956
particulars, that, in fact, are

429
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:19,628
generalities? So, again, it's one of

430
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,864
those things. I don't know. Daniel

431
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:24,444
probably knows whether it's a Where's

432
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:28,812
Waldo's thing or some sort of artist

433
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:31,392
that came up with some strange twist on

434
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,488
things. But the bottom line is, spend a

435
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:36,304
few minutes, have a look, because you'll

436
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,884
want to go through your own building of

437
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:42,256
what these relationships are, and you'll

438
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:44,884
also want to be able to consolidate. I

439
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:47,104
wasn't there when this representation

440
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:50,216
was built, but I do know that I want to

441
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:52,456
be able to both look at it, do a

442
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:55,064
comparative analysis to what I think the

443
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:57,096
Institute should be, and then be able to

444
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:58,120
consolidate.

445
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,876
Awesome. Yeah. Just a few notes on this

446
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,828
and to give a visual overview, since it

447
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,556
may be clearer to see this than go

448
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,072
through the prose that essentially

449
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:11,564
describes it as much later on. The

450
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,356
golden ring represents the active

451
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,856
inference ecosystem, and I think we

452
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:17,776
could talk about golden rings for a long

453
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,936
time to come. But coming in from the

454
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:24,820
ecosystem on the bottom bottom

455
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,276
for the reader, not from the other side

456
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,076
of the table, are the projects. And all

457
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:31,632
the projects are participatory

458
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:34,564
endeavors. They're happening behind,

459
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:37,520
on, and in front of the golden ring,

460
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,640
depending on how you look at it. And

461
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,360
that is the appendix and all of those

462
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,312
different projects that we talked about

463
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,752
and all of the iterations and new

464
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:49,688
threads that I know that we're going to

465
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,928
see in an hour and I know that we're

466
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,364
going to see in a month and in a year

467
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:57,816
and in a century. And those projects

468
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:01,470
are being supported through two

469
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,344
units, kind of like a department, but an

470
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,616
organizational unit, one centered on

471
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:10,576
education and one centered on research.

472
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,456
The education unit is called Educe, and

473
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,464
the research unit is called Reinforce.

474
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:17,376
So right there you kind of have active

475
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:19,830
inference, in case that wasn't clear

476
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,460
coming from the Institute scale.

477
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,812
Supporting the unit scale are a variety

478
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,496
of functions such as funding and

479
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,224
partnerships, communications and

480
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,896
hierarchical processes such as the

481
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:36,456
construction of enabling systems. And at

482
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:38,264
the institute scale, other than

483
00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:40,844
administrative functions. We have the

484
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:43,916
officers, the day to day operators of

485
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:45,996
the work, the board of directors, which

486
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:48,396
is the formal governing body, and the

487
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:51,596
scientific advisory board where we

488
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:55,056
really want to call out broadly and have

489
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:57,904
people who may have or may have not

490
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,360
thought that they would find themselves

491
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,216
in a scientific advisory board, for

492
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:04,372
example, in 2024. This is your

493
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,996
invitation. And we really want to have a

494
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,924
vibrant scientific advisory board who

495
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:12,548
serves liaison type roles with different

496
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:15,392
sectors and just gives periodic,

497
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:19,204
super valuable, high leverage insight.

498
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:22,296
And then, I guess, depending on how you

499
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,080
think about it, as all things we have

500
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,664
just a few terms. They don't just

501
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:31,576
represent bricks in the wall, but it's

502
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:35,004
more of like the

503
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,732
fibers we weave. And some of these are

504
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,750
already things that we do every day

505
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,932
courses, educational groups, events,

506
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:47,072
live streams, ontology research. Others

507
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,984
of these are things that we know will be

508
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:53,104
coming into place in the coming years

509
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:55,216
and we know that the tapestry is just

510
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:57,008
going to continue to expand. So it's

511
00:23:57,024 --> 00:24:00,612
really exciting. On Page Six,

512
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:03,284
we have another figure and this is just

513
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,396
another way to represent some of the

514
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,516
functions that we serve in the

515
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:08,596
ecosystem. This isn't the only or the

516
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:11,248
final or a fixed representation of the

517
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,096
functions that we have or the only way

518
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,544
to slice and dice or any of that, but

519
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:17,304
just to connect some of the dots between

520
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:19,516
the functions that we do and want to

521
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,460
serve for the ecosystem. So starting

522
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,404
from the broadest, let's just say where

523
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:29,260
the listener is, where you are right now

524
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,400
is in the space of awareness. And that

525
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,344
happens through communication. Some

526
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:39,248
people who become aware through a search

527
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:41,760
or a language model or a video

528
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,992
suggestion or a friend or happenstance

529
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,124
or synchronicity or however, some

530
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:51,152
fraction of the aware will pursue

531
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:55,076
education. And about education we

532
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:56,856
have and will continue to produce the

533
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:59,348
materials, documentation ontology

534
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:01,610
courses, live streams and so on.

535
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,580
Education is produced and rests upon

536
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,168
a commons. It's an epistemic commons.

537
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:11,240
It's a verified information environment.

538
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,724
And that is really the space. The

539
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,296
wildlife preserve, as I know Dean likes

540
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:19,676
to refer to it not jokingly at

541
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,944
all. And underneath the commons is the

542
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:27,170
support that does sit between

543
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,388
a participatory commons and a formal

544
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:35,204
governing kernel. That support in the

545
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,152
coming years may go many directions,

546
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:42,196
but we know it's going to involve all of

547
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:44,032
our favorite things like hardware,

548
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:47,108
software, information, behavior,

549
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:50,488
narrative, and more. And then we have

550
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:54,820
the regular institute scale

551
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,184
governance, partnership sponsor and

552
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,892
donor relationships such that we can

553
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:04,524
first find a type of stability or

554
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,960
sustainability and then more actively

555
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,516
play a regenerative role in our

556
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:12,364
ecosystem. We want to dispense micro

557
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:15,916
grants to people and we want to explore

558
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:18,704
paid internships and be able to meet

559
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:20,348
people where they are in their active

560
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:23,552
inference journey. And things

561
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:28,100
have been happening to that end and

562
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,270
through many means since 2021.

563
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,156
On page six. Pablo or Dean want to add

564
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,100
any thoughts?

565
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,088
I'm super excited about the governance,

566
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,260
the education on the game and tools.

567
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,680
In an hour we're going to see the first

568
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,850
active inference game. This is very fun.

569
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,440
On seven, we describe our vision,

570
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,292
our values and our principles. And just

571
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:07,236
to read the top level on the values and

572
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,824
principles, they are active inference

573
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:12,404
and exploration, integrity and

574
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:16,200
inclusivity, dynamic internal modeling,

575
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,764
anticipatory behavior, and continuous

576
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:23,064
development. On page eight,

577
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,080
we talk about some priorities and

578
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,232
challenge areas. These are challenges

579
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,832
across multiple scales. They're

580
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:33,564
challenges that individual people face

581
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:36,396
in their journey to learn and apply in

582
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,556
so many different backgrounds. These are

583
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,416
challenges of national interest. These

584
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:43,184
are challenges of global emergency as

585
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:46,284
well. These challenges are educational

586
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,416
in nature, for example, related to

587
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:50,844
scientific literacy and workforce

588
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:52,540
development and just general

589
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,790
professionalization in changing times.

590
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,300
On the research side, there are some

591
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,664
priorities and challenge areas related

592
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:03,984
to the fundamentals of cognitive science

593
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:06,136
and grounding the cognitive science in

594
00:28:06,158 --> 00:28:08,792
physics, getting that integrative first

595
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:12,296
principles framework that we expect and

596
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:15,864
prefer about information science and

597
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,288
diverse intelligences. Things are faster

598
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:21,804
and different than they have been, and

599
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:24,124
active inference is perfectly poised for

600
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,836
sense making and decision making in that

601
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:28,732
space. User experience,

602
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:31,148
accessibility, and sociotechnical

603
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:34,384
design. This is a major open question

604
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:37,024
across different settings, so it's not

605
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,876
uniquely held to the institute.

606
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:41,872
However, we really do believe and really

607
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:45,540
will commit to exploring new kinds of

608
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,692
ergonomics and onboardings and

609
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:53,012
experience so that we can come

610
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,280
through and be how we want to be.

611
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,464
From the first time somebody enters the

612
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,332
game. Where we can highlight

613
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:03,656
accessibility, meeting people in the

614
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,176
language that they prefer to listen to

615
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:08,200
and speak at the language, in computer

616
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,684
language or at the math level that

617
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:12,396
reflects somebody's preference in that

618
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,324
moment as well as being able to use

619
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,064
augmented and synthetic intelligence

620
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:19,868
systems to ramp up and even push the

621
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:23,360
frontier of what augmented people and

622
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,596
other kinds of collective intelligence

623
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:28,332
systems can do. Cyber and cognitive

624
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:31,996
security, these also are broader

625
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:35,344
topics. We've worked on these topics

626
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:36,784
from an active inference perspective.

627
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:38,868
Many have. And we think that this is

628
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:41,332
going to become increasingly relevant as

629
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:44,420
things do become more and more

630
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,712
challenging and uncertain in certain

631
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:49,716
ways out there. Scaling the active

632
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,456
inference ecosystem we've heard about

633
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:54,840
this from the narrow and technical side.

634
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,820
We had estimates of the computational

635
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,076
complexity of sophisticated inference

636
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:00,936
about how many computer operations have

637
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,796
to happen for a given calculation to

638
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,652
play out. And that's sometimes called

639
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:06,604
scaling. Active inference, like, okay,

640
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:09,548
it took 1 minute on 1GB of data, so how

641
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:11,036
many minutes is it going to take on this

642
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:13,676
computer with this much data? Scaling

643
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,456
the active inference ecosystem, though,

644
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:17,984
is a broader question, and that's where

645
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:21,184
we come to more of the social fabric and

646
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:23,712
the real sense of belonging that we all

647
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:25,620
want to have and co create and provide

648
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,484
for others in the ecosystem. And so this

649
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,660
kind of scaling is really

650
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,628
transdisciplinary. It's really skin in

651
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,712
the game. It's as real as it gets.

652
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:39,064
And applying active inference, some

653
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,160
applications we've heard from today,

654
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,520
some applications are cited in the early

655
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,476
pages of this paper, and more and more

656
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,524
come through every day, and we support

657
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,676
at the Institute various applications of

658
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:56,444
active inference. Dean, what can you add

659
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:57,230
in there?

660
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,876
Okay, my mute is off. Good. So here's

661
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:06,176
something that never came up in the

662
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,064
writing of the document, but I think

663
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:10,076
it's kind of interesting, and I'm

664
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:11,616
curious what you guys have to think

665
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:12,450
about this.

666
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,616
175 years ago, an institution came and

667
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:18,780
formed together. It's called the

668
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,492
Smithsonian Institute. Now, I don't know

669
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,132
if 175 years from this conversation

670
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,224
today, they'll be the equivalent of

671
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:31,412
whatever the Active Inference Institute

672
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:34,250
is 175 years forward,

673
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,608
but I think it's okay to start thinking

674
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:40,604
in those terms. It doesn't mean that we

675
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:43,064
follow in their footsteps, necessarily,

676
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,124
but I think it means that we have a long

677
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:48,844
term view and that the things that we

678
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:52,044
write about ourselves now have some

679
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:56,236
shelf life, have some real sense

680
00:31:56,338 --> 00:32:00,128
of, well, there are things that

681
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:02,848
we can and we cannot change. But if you

682
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,216
look at the front page, the landing page

683
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:07,364
of the Smithsonian Institute, the first

684
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:09,636
thing that they say is welcome, which is

685
00:32:09,658 --> 00:32:11,856
what we say about the Active Inference

686
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,556
Institute. And then they say, the

687
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,508
Smithsonian Institution is the world's

688
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:18,056
largest museum education and research

689
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:20,808
complex. We are a community of learning

690
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:24,408
and an opener of doors. Join us on a

691
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:25,960
voyage of discovery.

692
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,736
So in three sentences, they kind of sum

693
00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:32,572
themselves up, what's the formula for

694
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:35,836
not just existing for 175 years,

695
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:37,660
but being a force?

696
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,570
And I think, again,

697
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,924
Daniel, whatever you decide to highlight

698
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:46,896
in the document today, what I think

699
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:49,216
we're really trying to do is say, do the

700
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:52,992
words that we put out now, will they

701
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:55,940
continue to resonate with people for

702
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,436
decades to come? And again, I don't want

703
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,028
to sound all hand wavy, but I want to

704
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,604
hold up an example of a place that

705
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:06,872
really did set itself up to be something

706
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:08,824
that people could return to again and

707
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,336
again and again. And I don't think

708
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,704
there's anything wrong with aspiring to

709
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,576
having that kind of place, that kind

710
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:19,996
of respect. And I think that the things

711
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:21,484
that you're pointing to right now,

712
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:28,056
hopefully we're

713
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:32,428
preparing properly. So that's

714
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,530
what I'm taking away at this point.

715
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,172
We know about that preparation

716
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:40,316
measurement cycle from Chris Fields,

717
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:41,970
don't we? Yeah.

718
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,416
We go on, talk a little. Oh, yeah.

719
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:48,516
Please, Pablo. Go. No, no, definitely.

720
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:50,660
I completely agree. I've been thinking

721
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,350
about that for a long time.

722
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,216
You want to build and act for

723
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,496
the best of the future, and I think to

724
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:06,232
reflect that on the paper, it's super

725
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:09,916
important. Yeah, definitely up

726
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:12,670
to do that. Yeah,

727
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,708
way ahead. We describe some paths that

728
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:17,676
we want to take and the history of the

729
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:19,516
Institute. We describe our origins. But

730
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,808
I actually wanted to come to figure

731
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,352
three and four on page eleven to speak

732
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:28,784
to building one of the most amazing and

733
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:32,964
encouraging things has been the all

734
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:37,092
ages, all time zone, active build,

735
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:39,620
contribute mindset.

736
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,956
An earlier version of myself, I might

737
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:46,772
have thought, like people who do

738
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,668
variational Bayesian methods in machine

739
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,648
learning, they're going to have no issue

740
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,468
onboarding to active inference. It's

741
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:53,704
just going to be like as simple as

742
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:55,156
saying, yeah, it's a variational

743
00:34:55,188 --> 00:34:58,104
Bayesian model with action. So it's just

744
00:34:58,142 --> 00:34:59,748
signal processing on the inbound. It's

745
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,156
just control theory on the outbound.

746
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:02,676
But if you're familiar with variational

747
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,564
Bayes and variational free energy, this

748
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:07,356
isn't changing it that much. Oh, yeah,

749
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:09,128
we use a particular partition and it's

750
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:10,388
related to the free energy principle.

751
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:11,536
But don't worry too much, you'll get

752
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:15,810
there. I thought that that would be the

753
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,620
path for so many and future

754
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,076
analyses will reveal what they do or

755
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:29,524
don't reveal, but what we found in

756
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:33,604
our enacted work as

757
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:37,416
it really played out that there was

758
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:40,776
inclusion and unique contributions to

759
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:44,664
conversations ranging from philosophy of

760
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:48,264
science to fundamentals of statistics

761
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,284
and metascience and the role of

762
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,632
quantitative studies and social systems.

763
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:56,332
All these amazing topics and people

764
00:35:56,386 --> 00:36:00,452
who just scampered so rapidly

765
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:04,032
through what

766
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:06,736
could be seen as prerequisite from a

767
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,764
disciplinary perspective was facilitated

768
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:12,930
by the recognition that one was already

769
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,356
in the space and in the way that they

770
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:18,500
needed to be to be an active inference.

771
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,284
And that was not written out before

772
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:25,516
and even now the traces are barely

773
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:27,784
recorded, but it will become to be

774
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,320
understood more fully.

775
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,456
And to your point, Daniel, I think

776
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:39,404
especially what the pie chart shows is

777
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:43,084
the actual spectrum aspect of

778
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:46,508
this. So I know that right now that

779
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,956
maybe the neuroscience and the

780
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:52,092
psychology piece take up a bigger

781
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:55,184
portion. But I think one of the things

782
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:57,088
that we're trying to promote is the idea

783
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:00,576
that you can come from just about

784
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:04,448
any background as opposed to, oh,

785
00:37:04,614 --> 00:37:07,316
all paths lead to, as you said, an

786
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:09,604
earlier version of you said, oh, okay,

787
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:10,964
well, I can see where everything is

788
00:37:11,002 --> 00:37:13,444
going to where the confluence is going

789
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:17,284
to. No, I think what this demonstrates

790
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,432
is that it's actually becoming more

791
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:23,400
distributed the longer we

792
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,200
continue to exist.

793
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,572
Yeah, this figure, of course, I'm super

794
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,604
happy with everything that we were able

795
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:34,636
to do, but this figure is almost a

796
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:37,836
little bit like a

797
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,252
paper target that we're just going to

798
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:43,584
blow out later. Because it was a

799
00:37:43,622 --> 00:37:46,864
fraction of only people who had

800
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,864
formal affiliations listed, which means

801
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,544
only people for whom we had done full

802
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:52,748
literature based pulling up their

803
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,900
information. So it doesn't even

804
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,160
represent the actual participation

805
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,804
profile. This is more like the

806
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:03,620
invitation list for live streams.

807
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,250
So we are going to see another

808
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,404
long tail that covers

809
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,456
the part that's not the long tail. I

810
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:18,796
believe the

811
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,844
rest of the paper continues along

812
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:23,820
possibilities, challenges, next steps,

813
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,380
more about the institute organization,

814
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,850
various other pieces of information that

815
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,264
potentially eager stakeholders or

816
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:37,104
participants or donors or liaisons or

817
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:40,384
other people would like to learn more

818
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:43,204
about. It's there to engage with. We

819
00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:46,964
want people to hop into our discord and

820
00:38:47,002 --> 00:38:50,356
continue the conversation or email us or

821
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,956
otherwise get involved. It's why we

822
00:38:54,138 --> 00:38:56,144
called this symposium enacting

823
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:58,344
Ecosystems of Shared Intelligence at

824
00:38:58,382 --> 00:39:01,736
the, of course, relevant suggestion of

825
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,696
Karl Friston, because we really do want

826
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,628
to enact it. So if you feel like you're

827
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,556
on the sideline waiting to jump in or

828
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:10,396
you're on the beach and people are out

829
00:39:10,418 --> 00:39:13,630
there surfing the 100 foot wave, then

830
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,448
maybe it's time to get more involved.

831
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:20,864
So I will leave the closing word first

832
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:24,624
to Dean, then Pablo, and then we'll go

833
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,120
to Raph's presentation.

834
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,536
Well, just real quick, again, if you

835
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:34,336
want a consolidated document that speaks

836
00:39:34,368 --> 00:39:38,036
to the now but also points to a

837
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:42,244
direction that none of us really know is

838
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:44,384
certain, but is also really exciting,

839
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:45,960
have a look at the doc.

840
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,360
Pablo?

841
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,192
Yeah. I'm here to make

842
00:39:57,246 --> 00:40:00,824
sure that I act as one

843
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:03,880
of those people of all backgrounds and

844
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,588
perspectives that has taken advantage

845
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:10,770
through one year of learning and working

846
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,496
on this institute, and hopefully see you

847
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:17,840
in 1 hour. So thank you and

848
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,152
have fun. Thanks. Awesome. Thank you.

849
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:23,344
Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Pablo.

850
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:26,020
Welcome, Raf, also author on the paper.
