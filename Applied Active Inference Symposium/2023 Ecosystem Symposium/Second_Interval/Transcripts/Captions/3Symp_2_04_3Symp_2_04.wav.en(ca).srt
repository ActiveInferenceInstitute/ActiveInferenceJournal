1
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:11,241
Daniel: Right.

2
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:15,677
All right.

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,449
For the next interval, we are in the

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,748
section hosted by the Active Inference

5
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:29,039
Institute on our recent paper, active

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,307
Inference Institute and the Active

7
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:34,496
Inference Ecosystem.

8
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,858
So two short messages.

9
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,177
First, if you're in the live chat, I'll

10
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:43,479
post the link right now to the paper.

11
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,751
And this can be more of like a

12
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,963
conversational interval.

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,327
So if you have any questions about the

14
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:56,694
ecosystem or the institute or any of the

15
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:59,034
stuff that we're talking about, let's

16
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:01,678
make it a conversation.

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,791
And then second message.

18
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,169
If there are any co authors on this paper

19
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:10,514
who are listening to this stream, then

20
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,842
message me on discord or post in the

21
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,169
YouTube live chat or just check your

22
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:20,506
calendar, and I expect some others to

23
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:22,706
join in as we go.

24
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:25,048
Welcome, Pablo.

25
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:30,509
We'll be hearing in a little bit from you

26
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,683
as a presenter.

27
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:34,934
Is there anything that you want to just

28
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,185
bring up or reflect on before I share the

29
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:39,417
screen with the paper and we just walk

30
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:41,607
through it, explore it and hear

31
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:41,692
questions?

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,092
It okay.

33
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,177
I'll bring in the paper.

34
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:11,206
And again, anyone watching live, please

35
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:14,235
just feel free to write any questions,

36
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,264
and I'm just going to bring it so that

37
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,270
Pablo.

38
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,308
You're not going to see the paper, but it'

39
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,326
's on the live stream.

40
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:30,398
All right, cool.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,493
Well, here we go.

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,535
This is a paper that had an awesome co

43
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,566
authorship and even broader circles

44
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:50,595
beyond the listed co authors of

45
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:53,626
collaboration and contribution.

46
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:57,667
So just like everything that has happened

47
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,642
and will happen in our work, it was

48
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:04,676
massively participatory and a real

49
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:08,713
learning by doing and a real enactment

50
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:09,724
moment.

51
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:13,768
The first version was released three days

52
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:16,796
ago on Saturday, August 19, and I'll

53
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,825
briefly just list all the authors.

54
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:23,863
First, we had the institute as the first

55
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:26,898
author so that the citation can always

56
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:29,926
remain like institute et al.

57
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,955
Institute, comma active Inference

58
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:33,964
institute.

59
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,991
And we also had Andrea Guire, John Boyk,

60
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:38,017
Lieber Burian, matthew Brown, RJ Corday,

61
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,031
scott David david S.

62
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,061
Douglas, Pablo Fernandez Macchia, Daniel

63
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,089
Friedman, holly Grimm, Avele Gwynen,

64
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,116
carlo Maria, Louisa Ayenico, virginia

65
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:51,145
Blue Knight, alexandra Mikhailova, Ali

66
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:54,176
Ramju Adil Razi, jacob Smith, rene Tamari,

67
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:57,202
, dean Tickles and Alex Viakin.

68
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,171
So this includes everyone from founders

69
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,199
and officers and board of directors and

70
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,228
formal participants on different projects

71
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:08,253
and different roles as volunteers or

72
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,282
facilitators or interns, and also people

73
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:13,308
who are continuing to join the fun and

74
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:16,335
show up and makes the institute in our

75
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:19,364
field what it is and what it can be, what

76
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:21,382
we want it to be.

77
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,438
There's a table of contents for those who

78
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,453
like to click through.

79
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,473
And just broadly, there's going to be a

80
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,487
preamble on active inference.

81
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:34,518
But outside of the preamble, this paper

82
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:37,548
is not conceptual, it is not technical,

83
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,579
it is not philosophical, although perhaps

84
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,610
it can be read in all of those ways, but

85
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,640
it's quite a logistical, historical, and

86
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,671
vision oriented position document.

87
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,703
After getting some of the active

88
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,727
inferences out of the way in the preamble.

89
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:55,727
.

90
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,752
We're going to turn to the institute

91
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,718
itself in terms of our vision, values,

92
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,745
principles, and how we see moving through

93
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,770
the challenges that we're facing right

94
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,794
now onto the specific history of the

95
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:11,821
institute, our current organization model

96
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,848
in terms of our governance and leadership

97
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,875
structure, as well as the institute units,

98
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,901
, the organizational units that support

99
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:20,918
all the work we do.

100
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,951
We then turn out to the community and

101
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,981
ecosystem growth and development and go

102
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,011
through some details of different roles

103
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,043
that our stakeholders and participants in

104
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:36,072
our space and some of the tools that we

105
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:39,102
use today for managing information and

106
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:40,119
message passing.

107
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,141
We talk a little bit about our

108
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:45,159
communications plan, internal and

109
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,182
external, both sides of the blanket, and

110
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,201
point towards some of the types of

111
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,217
support, infrastructure and

112
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,238
administration that we do and that we

113
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:54,258
will offer for the active inference

114
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:55,267
ecosystem.

115
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,291
We frame that in terms of continual

116
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,256
deployment, continual development and

117
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,276
quality, performance and growth

118
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:05,302
evaluations across multiple scales, close

119
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:07,328
with some discussion and then provide an

120
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:10,353
appendix that overviews a variety of the

121
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,378
open source services that the Institute

122
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,400
has provided over the past.

123
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:17,427
So let's just jump in.

124
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,451
I'm actually going to jump into the open

125
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,474
source services first and overview them

126
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:24,495
before we jump back up to the top and

127
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,511
look at the big picture.

128
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,538
Because this is really to appreciate the

129
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:31,564
work of so many contributors who stepped

130
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:33,588
up in the uncanny valley, in the gray

131
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:36,614
zone, in the ecosystem, as it's forming,

132
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:39,639
as it's always forming, and really made

133
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:39,649
it happen.

134
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,674
And so many people we know are out there

135
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,697
scribbling or taking notes or printing

136
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,716
out papers by Friston at all or

137
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:48,738
struggling and asking questions, are

138
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,757
there applications of this?

139
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:51,766
How would this matter?

140
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:52,777
Why would this matter?

141
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,792
Is there a code version of this?

142
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:55,806
How do you connect the dots between

143
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:55,808
these?

144
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:57,828
Like, those are what we ask every day.

145
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:00,796
And so when people can combine their

146
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,824
regimes of attention into a synthetic

147
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,855
intelligence outcome, then we go so far.

148
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,887
So the first category of works that the

149
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,917
Institute has developed are educational.

150
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,943
We've done video live streams since the

151
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:16,950
end of 2020.

152
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:19,982
Till now, more than 370 live streams.

153
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:23,027
All live streams are curated in terms of

154
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,046
their transcript.

155
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:28,072
And we increasingly are developing

156
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,099
automated and semiautomated methods for

157
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,121
transcription, translation, sub,

158
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,151
captioning, language modeling and so on.

159
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,176
We've had textbook groups actually.

160
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:41,201
Now, as of now, we have three completed

161
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,226
cohorts of the active inference textbook

162
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,243
group, the 2022 textbook.

163
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,268
We have two courses that are being

164
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,289
offered that are produced by external

165
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:52,309
content developers, and both of these

166
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,332
have only started in the last three, four

167
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:54,338
months.

168
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,361
First is Chris Fields's, physics is

169
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,386
Information Processing, and second is the

170
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:02,351
work spearheaded by Avel and co organized

171
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,376
with Kairos Research, active inference in

172
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,391
the social sciences.

173
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:08,415
Both of these are like awesome and great

174
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,438
learning experiences, as we heard from

175
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,454
earlier in the symposium.

176
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:15,480
We're working with Sanjeev Namjoshi on

177
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,507
his incredible textbook, although almost

178
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,534
to call it a textbook is to either think

179
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,562
more broadly about textbooks than one has

180
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,589
or constrain what it really is that he's

181
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,616
doing, because it's such a unique, real

182
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:31,639
research development, full spectrum

183
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:31,649
effort.

184
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,678
So I'm really looking forward to seeing

185
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,698
how this plays out in 2024.

186
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:39,727
Until then, for those who want to get

187
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,751
involved with the testing that we do and

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,772
we've developed the Active Inference

189
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,795
Ontology, which is a critical resource

190
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:47,808
for the ecosystem.

191
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,832
It enables us to center accessibility,

192
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,857
rigor and applicability across languages

193
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,881
and settings by knowing what it is that

194
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,905
we're talking about when we talk about

195
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:58,918
active inference.

196
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,884
On the research side, we've also

197
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,906
developed the Ontology in a research

198
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,928
direction in terms of research on and

199
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,953
about and with active inference itself.

200
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,982
As far as software goes, our primary

201
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:13,001
development, first off, has been the

202
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:15,020
documentation and connecting the dots

203
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,039
around some of these other incredible

204
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,060
packages that others are developing.

205
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:22,091
For example, just in this symposium, we'

206
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:24,113
've heard from some of the core

207
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:27,142
developers and open source contributors

208
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:29,165
to Pymdp, the Python package for

209
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:32,192
generative modeling, as well as just a

210
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:35,221
couple of minutes ago from Bert de Fryes

211
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:38,250
and Dmitry Bagueev coming from the Julia

212
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,272
language RX and FIR side.

213
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:41,289
And both of those are some of the leading

214
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,304
packages for applying active inference.

215
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,322
So we do a lot of work to connect those

216
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:46,337
dots and make it more accessible.

217
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:49,361
Not everybody is going to jump in with

218
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,383
all 6ft to a programming language.

219
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,403
And what we've done with Active

220
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:55,425
Blockfriends, with the work of Jacob

221
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,449
Smekal and others, is to wrap generative

222
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,413
models from active inference inside of

223
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,437
the complex systems modeling framework

224
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,444
Catcat.

225
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:06,471
We've developed notation interoperability

226
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,494
systems that actually let us pull back

227
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,516
one layer from the implementational

228
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,539
details themselves, for example, of RX

229
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,563
infer or of Pymdp, so that we can bring

230
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,587
it halfway to where the ontology and the

231
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:20,611
visualization and the natural language

232
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,635
exists, and then use language models and

233
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,656
other techniques to deploy it in an

234
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,676
implementation fashion.

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,698
We've developed a host of research

236
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:29,706
publications.

237
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,738
We support people in all of their

238
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:35,762
different stages of their career,

239
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,787
different seasons of life, and some

240
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:40,814
really creative work has been directly

241
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:43,843
produced through an institute project or

242
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,870
somebody who knows may have gotten good

243
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,898
ideas or good feedback just by hanging

244
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,919
out, being in the game.

245
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,947
And we performed literature metaanalyses

246
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,973
to help grapple with the scope and the

247
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,996
quantity and the quality of what is

248
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:01,963
unfolding before our eyes or before our

249
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:02,971
antenna.

250
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:04,995
Again, even as we only so partially

251
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,020
sample this ocean of information, we're

252
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,046
active in standard setting and continue

253
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,071
to develop our qualification standards

254
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,096
for active inference that could be the

255
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,117
basis of education, research and

256
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:18,137
professional development.

257
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,171
We provide a variety of mentorship and

258
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:24,196
facilitation service type activities,

259
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:27,222
including volunteer program, internship

260
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,247
program, distributed facilitation, and

261
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:32,273
applied active inference symposia.

262
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,295
These activities, just as all others that

263
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,315
we're describing above, are open source,

264
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,330
and they're also open to your

265
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:38,339
participation.

266
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,362
So if you can follow some of those

267
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,385
suggestions by JF time boxing and

268
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,408
prioritize and pay attention and be

269
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,436
active, all those fun things that he said,

270
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,463
, and you're looking to do it in a semi

271
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,490
structured way with a volunteer program,

272
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,514
or in a more structured way with the

273
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,539
internship, then I heartily encourage

274
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,499
people to get involved.

275
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,510
Act now.

276
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,550
And in terms of governance activity, we

277
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,581
have a scientific advisory board as well

278
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,601
as a board of directors.

279
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,622
And together with the officers, those

280
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:15,643
groups constitute the formal governance

281
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:16,659
structure of the Institute.

282
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:19,682
But there's also so much more to it, and

283
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:21,703
we look forward to understanding what

284
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,726
ecosystem governance can look like in the

285
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:24,735
coming years.

286
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,755
So welcome, Dean.

287
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:29,783
I just summarized the work itself.

288
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:32,812
That was the preamble.

289
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,836
And now if you'd like to say hi, you or

290
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,858
Pablo, before we jump into more sections

291
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:39,880
of the paper or look at more questions

292
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,902
that people have asked, how goes it?

293
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,921
Or what was your experience of working

294
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:43,929
with the paper?

295
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,964
Or what brings you onto this strange

296
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,993
stream at this opportune time?

297
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,057
Dean: Basically why I'm here is because

298
00:12:56,057 --> 00:13:00,034
for the first time, even as an acting

299
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:04,071
board member with the Institute, I was

300
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:08,111
able to get a better sense of the kind of

301
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,138
depth that we aspire to.

302
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:14,176
And I'm not sure whether or not we are

303
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:17,207
going to be I really don't know what

304
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:21,243
directions we're going to be going in the

305
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:24,274
next coming months, weeks, years, et

306
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,284
cetera.

307
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,310
But I have a better sense now, as a

308
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,331
result of participating in this

309
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,353
development exercise, of what the

310
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,380
potential is than I probably had at any

311
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:35,386
time.

312
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:37,407
And I've been with the Active Inference

313
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,428
Institute for a couple of years, so that'

314
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,438
's saying something.

315
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:44,469
I think we had to get to this point to be

316
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:47,500
able to write this document, and now it's

317
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,527
acting as a bit of a springboard now

318
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,553
which way we go and how we land.

319
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,577
I'm not still certain about what that

320
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:57,600
looks like, but I think that's part of

321
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,624
what the really interesting thing is.

322
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:03,603
We seem to have moved away from the dock,

323
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:06,631
and now the real journey begins.

324
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,653
So that's my take on it so far.

325
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,701
Daniel: Moving away from the dock, dock

326
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:16,731
pushing off, using it as a springboard,

327
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,760
continuing the adventure, leaving the

328
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,791
preprint behind, continuing to version it

329
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,822
as a living document and also wayfinding

330
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,840
outside of the doc.

331
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:28,850
Dean: Pablo.

332
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:35,925
Daniel: Oh, wait, I don't hear you yet.

333
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:36,932
Pablo.

334
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,979
Pablo: Sorry, I was mute.

335
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:41,988
Hello.

336
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:45,022
It was a great experience to go through

337
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,056
the document and review it and reread it

338
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:50,076
and thinking about it.

339
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,113
Actually, it's a living document, which

340
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:57,146
is super exciting, and I keep taking

341
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,119
notes and hopefully act on it in the

342
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,128
future.

343
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:09,201
And it's been a super experience to find

344
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:14,254
so many people with the same interest,

345
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:19,304
same interest and some values that I

346
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:25,361
really think are going to be the basis of

347
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:29,406
organizations on the future.

348
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:32,430
So I think we are doing something very

349
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:32,437
cool here.

350
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:34,456
Daniel: Cool.

351
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:38,495
All right, well, let's just walk through

352
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,531
some of the sections in the 25 minutes

353
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,545
that we have.

354
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:46,576
Again, the paper is being shown on the

355
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,599
stream, but Dean And probably don't see

356
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,602
it.

357
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:54,658
So we kicked off with a preamble.

358
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,692
We wanted to introduce active inference

359
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,663
as briefly as we could and point towards

360
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:04,690
the fundamental first principles and

361
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,720
physics based nature of active inference

362
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,743
and initially point towards its

363
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:12,772
integrative capacity in principle.

364
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,808
And then in the second paragraph, there's

365
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,840
about 104 citations in this paragraph.

366
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,879
And that's where it's really only a

367
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,920
sampling of the domains, 21 domains here.

368
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:27,921
.

369
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,947
So it's a place where we can point to

370
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,972
where is active inference being applied,

371
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,997
or how is active inference being applied,

372
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:37,020
or how is it different or better than

373
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,045
another approach in a given setting?

374
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:41,065
Which isn't to say that it does

375
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:44,090
everything in all settings for all people

376
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,115
at all times and all of that, but this is

377
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:49,139
to say that here's where one can look to

378
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,164
find out more and even just building.

379
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:53,185
This and bringing it all together.

380
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,211
We see so many opportunities for

381
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,237
epistemic resources in the ecosystem and

382
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:01,203
having real time literature analyses and

383
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,228
all these kinds of services that we want

384
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:04,238
to provide.

385
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,291
Starting on page five, we turn to the

386
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,314
institute itself and we write as of

387
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:14,336
August 2023, the Active Inference

388
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,359
Institute is a registered nonprofit

389
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,383
organization tasked with identifying,

390
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,403
establishing, and managing the

391
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,422
sustainable implementation of

392
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,448
administrative and governance functions

393
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,469
to give components of the active

394
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:30,494
inference ecosystem coherent forms and

395
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:33,523
reliable channels of communication.

396
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,546
Two, publishing and licensing protocols

397
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,566
that establish open and fair use and

398
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:39,586
effective dissemination of community

399
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,608
products within and beyond the ecosystem.

400
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,610
.

401
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,629
Three, services at the scale of

402
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,651
individual humans and the community at

403
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,672
large so that stability is protected

404
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,695
while risk and uncertainty are minimized

405
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,709
within the ecosystem.

406
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,737
And four, organization and operation of

407
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:57,765
cyber and cognitive security systems that

408
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:59,788
ensure productivity, inclusivity

409
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,758
accessibility, and safety in discourse.

410
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:07,802
In collaboration, figure one gives a

411
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:12,851
graphical representation, just one of how

412
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:13,867
we are now.

413
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,899
And for those who want to dig more, check

414
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,927
out the 2022 Active Inference textbook

415
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:22,956
where you'll also find a golden ring.

416
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,989
And we kind of took that graphical motif

417
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,000
and ran with it.

418
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,002
Had a lot of fun and a lot of

419
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:30,003
interpretations there.

420
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:34,007
So just here looking at figure one, Dean

421
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,010
or Pablo just want to add anything?

422
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,015
Yeah, Dean.

423
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:48,021
Dean: So one thing about the building of

424
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:51,024
this document with a whole bunch of

425
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:55,028
authors, it's often not made explicit,

426
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:59,032
but there are two aspects to learning

427
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,028
about yourself.

428
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:04,031
One is to actually throw some stuff down

429
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,034
on paper because you believe certain

430
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,036
things need to be included.

431
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:12,039
And then the second part is the

432
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,040
consolidation process.

433
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,044
And I think one of the most interesting

434
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,047
consolidation processes was this graphic,

435
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:24,051
because I think what it does is it tries

436
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:27,054
to condense as much as possible and yet

437
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,057
still remain coherent around what the

438
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:34,061
relational aspects that we are trying to

439
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:37,064
make available are, as opposed to, this

440
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:40,066
is what we've captured.

441
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,070
Now look what our graphic designer came

442
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,071
up with.

443
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:48,075
So if you've had a chance to kind of look

444
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,077
at this and really analyze it and think

445
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,080
about the layers and think about, okay,

446
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,083
so what's the background here?

447
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,084
What's the foreground?

448
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:01,082
Does this representation allow for a

449
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
swapping?

450
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,085
Can we have things that appear to be

451
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,088
background or fundamental basis stuff

452
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,091
that could actually be things that we are

453
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,093
addressing in the moment versus those

454
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,096
things which we look at as particulars,

455
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,098
that, in fact, are generalities?

456
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:20,101
So, again, it's one of those things.

457
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,102
I don't know.

458
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,105
Daniel probably knows whether it's a

459
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,108
Where's Waldo's thing or some sort of

460
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,111
artist that came up with some strange

461
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,112
twist on things.

462
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:34,115
But the bottom line is, spend a few

463
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,117
minutes, have a look, because you'll want

464
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:39,120
to go through your own building of what

465
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,122
these relationships are, and you'll also

466
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,125
want to be able to consolidate.

467
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,128
I wasn't there when this representation

468
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:49,130
was built, but I do know that I want to

469
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,132
be able to both look at it, do a

470
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,135
comparative analysis to what I think the

471
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:57,137
Institute should be, and then be able to

472
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,139
consolidate.

473
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,136
Daniel: Awesome.

474
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
Yeah.

475
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,138
Just a few notes on this and to give a

476
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,140
visual overview, since it may be clearer

477
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,142
to see this than go through the prose

478
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,144
that essentially describes it as much

479
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,145
later on.

480
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,148
The golden ring represents the active

481
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,150
inference ecosystem, and I think we could

482
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,152
talk about golden rings for a long time

483
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,153
to come.

484
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,156
But coming in from the ecosystem on the

485
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,159
bottom bottom for the reader, not from

486
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,162
the other side of the table, are the

487
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,163
projects.

488
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,166
And all the projects are participatory

489
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,167
endeavors.

490
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,169
They're happening behind, on, and in

491
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,172
front of the golden ring, depending on

492
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,174
how you look at it.

493
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,176
And that is the appendix and all of those

494
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,179
different projects that we talked about

495
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,182
and all of the iterations and new threads

496
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,184
that I know that we're going to see in an

497
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,187
hour and I know that we're going to see

498
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,190
in a month and in a year and in a century.

499
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,190
.

500
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,194
And those projects are being supported

501
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,191
through two units, kind of like a

502
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:05,194
department, but an organizational unit,

503
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,197
one centered on education and one

504
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,199
centered on research.

505
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,202
The education unit is called Educe, and

506
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:15,204
the research unit is called Reinforce.

507
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:18,207
So right there you kind of have active

508
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,209
inference, in case that wasn't clear

509
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,212
coming from the Institute scale.

510
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,215
Supporting the unit scale are a variety

511
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,217
of functions such as funding and

512
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:31,220
partnerships, communications and

513
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,222
hierarchical processes such as the

514
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:35,224
construction of enabling systems.

515
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:38,227
And at the institute scale, other than

516
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:39,228
administrative functions.

517
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:42,231
We have the officers, the day to day

518
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:44,233
operators of the work, the board of

519
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:47,236
directors, which is the formal governing

520
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:50,239
body, and the scientific advisory board

521
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,242
where we really want to call out broadly

522
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,244
and have people who may have or may have

523
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:58,247
not thought that they would find

524
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,244
themselves in a scientific advisory board,

525
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,246
, for example, in 2024.

526
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,247
This is your invitation.

527
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,250
And we really want to have a vibrant

528
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,253
scientific advisory board who serves

529
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,256
liaison type roles with different sectors

530
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:17,260
and just gives periodic, super valuable,

531
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,262
high leverage insight.

532
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,265
And then, I guess, depending on how you

533
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:25,268
think about it, as all things we have

534
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,270
just a few terms.

535
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,274
They don't just represent bricks in the

536
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:35,278
wall, but it's more of like the fibers we

537
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,279
weave.

538
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,282
And some of these are already things that

539
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:42,285
we do every day courses, educational

540
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:45,288
groups, events, live streams, ontology

541
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:46,289
research.

542
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:49,292
Others of these are things that we know

543
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,294
will be coming into place in the coming

544
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,297
years and we know that the tapestry is

545
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,299
just going to continue to expand.

546
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,300
So it's really exciting.

547
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,298
On Page Six, we have another figure and

548
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,300
this is just another way to represent

549
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,303
some of the functions that we serve in

550
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:07,304
the ecosystem.

551
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,306
This isn't the only or the final or a

552
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,308
fixed representation of the functions

553
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,310
that we have or the only way to slice and

554
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,312
dice or any of that, but just to connect

555
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:18,315
some of the dots between the functions

556
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,317
that we do and want to serve for the

557
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:21,317
ecosystem.

558
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:24,321
So starting from the broadest, let's just

559
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:28,325
say where the listener is, where you are

560
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:31,328
right now is in the space of awareness.

561
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:34,331
And that happens through communication.

562
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:38,335
Some people who become aware through a

563
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,338
search or a language model or a video

564
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,341
suggestion or a friend or happenstance or

565
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:48,345
synchronicity or however, some fraction

566
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:51,348
of the aware will pursue education.

567
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,351
And about education we have and will

568
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,354
continue to produce the materials,

569
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:00,351
documentation ontology courses, live

570
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:01,352
streams and so on.

571
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:06,357
Education is produced and rests upon a

572
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,358
commons.

573
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,360
It's an epistemic commons.

574
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,362
It's a verified information environment.

575
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:13,364
And that is really the space.

576
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:16,367
The wildlife preserve, as I know Dean

577
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:20,371
likes to refer to it not jokingly at all.

578
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:20,371
.

579
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:24,375
And underneath the commons is the support

580
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:28,379
that does sit between a participatory

581
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:32,383
commons and a formal governing kernel.

582
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:36,387
That support in the coming years may go

583
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,390
many directions, but we know it's going

584
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,394
to involve all of our favorite things

585
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:46,397
like hardware, software, information,

586
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:49,400
behavior, narrative, and more.

587
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,403
And then we have the regular institute

588
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:56,407
scale governance, partnership sponsor and

589
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:59,410
donor relationships such that we can

590
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,407
first find a type of stability or

591
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:06,411
sustainability and then more actively

592
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,414
play a regenerative role in our ecosystem.

593
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:10,415
.

594
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,417
We want to dispense micro grants to

595
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,420
people and we want to explore paid

596
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,422
internships and be able to meet people

597
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:20,425
where they are in their active inference

598
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:21,426
journey.

599
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:26,431
And things have been happening to that

600
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:31,436
end and through many means since 2021.

601
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:33,438
On page six.

602
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:36,441
Pablo or Dean want to add any thoughts?

603
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,446
Pablo: I'm super excited about the

604
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:44,449
governance, the education on the game and

605
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:45,450
tools.

606
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:50,455
Daniel: In an hour we're going to see the

607
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:53,458
first active inference game.

608
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,459
This is very fun.

609
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:01,460
On seven, we describe our vision, our

610
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,462
values and our principles.

611
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:06,465
And just to read the top level on the

612
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:09,468
values and principles, they are active

613
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:13,472
inference and exploration, integrity and

614
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:16,475
inclusivity, dynamic internal modeling,

615
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:19,478
anticipatory behavior, and continuous

616
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,479
development.

617
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,483
On page eight, we talk about some

618
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,485
priorities and challenge areas.

619
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:28,487
These are challenges across multiple

620
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:29,488
scales.

621
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:32,491
They're challenges that individual people

622
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,494
face in their journey to learn and apply

623
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:37,496
in so many different backgrounds.

624
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,499
These are challenges of national interest.

625
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
.

626
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,502
These are challenges of global emergency

627
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
as well.

628
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,505
These challenges are educational in

629
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,507
nature, for example, related to

630
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,509
scientific literacy and workforce

631
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,511
development and just general

632
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:54,513
professionalization in changing times.

633
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:58,517
On the research side, there are some

634
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:01,514
priorities and challenge areas related to

635
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,517
the fundamentals of cognitive science and

636
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,519
grounding the cognitive science in

637
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,522
physics, getting that integrative first

638
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,525
principles framework that we expect and

639
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,528
prefer about information science and

640
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,530
diverse intelligences.

641
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,533
Things are faster and different than they

642
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,535
have been, and active inference is

643
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,537
perfectly poised for sense making and

644
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,539
decision making in that space.

645
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,543
User experience, accessibility, and

646
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,544
sociotechnical design.

647
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,547
This is a major open question across

648
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,550
different settings, so it's not uniquely

649
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,551
held to the institute.

650
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,555
However, we really do believe and really

651
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:46,559
will commit to exploring new kinds of

652
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,563
ergonomics and onboardings and experience

653
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,567
so that we can come through and be how we

654
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,569
want to be.

655
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,572
From the first time somebody enters the

656
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,567
game.

657
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,569
Where we can highlight accessibility,

658
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:05,572
meeting people in the language that they

659
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,574
prefer to listen to and speak at the

660
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,577
language, in computer language or at the

661
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,579
math level that reflects somebody's

662
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:14,581
preference in that moment as well as

663
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,584
being able to use augmented and synthetic

664
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,586
intelligence systems to ramp up and even

665
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,588
push the frontier of what augmented

666
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:24,591
people and other kinds of collective

667
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,593
intelligence systems can do.

668
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:30,597
Cyber and cognitive security, these also

669
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,599
are broader topics.

670
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,602
We've worked on these topics from an

671
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:36,603
active inference perspective.

672
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:37,604
Many have.

673
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:40,607
And we think that this is going to become

674
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,610
increasingly relevant as things do become

675
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,612
more and more challenging and uncertain

676
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:47,614
in certain ways out there.

677
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:51,618
Scaling the active inference ecosystem we'

678
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:53,620
've heard about this from the narrow and

679
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,621
technical side.

680
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,623
We had estimates of the computational

681
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:58,625
complexity of sophisticated inference

682
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,621
about how many computer operations have

683
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:03,624
to happen for a given calculation to play

684
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
out.

685
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,626
And that's sometimes called scaling.

686
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,628
Active inference, like, okay, it took 1

687
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,630
minute on 1GB of data, so how many

688
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,632
minutes is it going to take on this

689
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:12,633
computer with this much data?

690
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,636
Scaling the active inference ecosystem,

691
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:18,639
though, is a broader question, and that's

692
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,641
where we come to more of the social

693
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,643
fabric and the real sense of belonging

694
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,645
that we all want to have and co create

695
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:27,648
and provide for others in the ecosystem.

696
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:30,651
And so this kind of scaling is really

697
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:31,652
transdisciplinary.

698
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:33,654
It's really skin in the game.

699
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,656
It's as real as it gets.

700
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:38,659
And applying active inference, some

701
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,662
applications we've heard from today, some

702
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,665
applications are cited in the early pages

703
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,668
of this paper, and more and more come

704
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:50,671
through every day, and we support at the

705
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:53,674
Institute various applications of active

706
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:54,675
inference.

707
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:57,678
Dean, what can you add in there?

708
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:01,676
Dean: Okay, my mute is off.

709
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:02,677
Good.

710
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,680
So here's something that never came up in

711
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
the writing of the document, but I think

712
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:09,684
it's kind of interesting, and I'm curious

713
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:12,687
what you guys have to think about this.

714
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,692
175 years ago, an institution came and

715
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:18,693
formed together.

716
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,695
It's called the Smithsonian Institute.

717
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:24,699
Now, I don't know if 175 years from this

718
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,702
conversation today, they'll be the

719
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,704
equivalent of whatever the Active

720
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:33,708
Inference Institute is 175 years forward,

721
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,711
but I think it's okay to start thinking

722
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,713
in those terms.

723
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,716
It doesn't mean that we follow in their

724
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:45,720
footsteps, necessarily, but I think it

725
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,723
means that we have a long term view and

726
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,726
that the things that we write about

727
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:54,729
ourselves now have some shelf life, have

728
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,732
some real sense of, well, there are

729
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:01,730
things that we can and we cannot change.

730
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,732
But if you look at the front page, the

731
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:06,735
landing page of the Smithsonian Institute,

732
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:08,737
, the first thing that they say is

733
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:10,739
welcome, which is what we say about the

734
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,741
Active Inference Institute.

735
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,743
And then they say, the Smithsonian

736
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:17,746
Institution is the world's largest museum

737
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:18,747
education and research complex.

738
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:21,750
We are a community of learning and an

739
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,751
opener of doors.

740
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:25,754
Join us on a voyage of discovery.

741
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:30,759
So in three sentences, they kind of sum

742
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:33,762
themselves up, what's the formula for not

743
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:36,765
just existing for 175 years, but being a

744
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:37,766
force?

745
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,771
And I think, again, Daniel, whatever you

746
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:45,774
decide to highlight in the document today,

747
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:49,777
, what I think we're really trying to do

748
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,781
is say, do the words that we put out now,

749
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:55,783
will they continue to resonate with

750
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:57,786
people for decades to come?

751
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:00,783
And again, I don't want to sound all hand

752
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,785
wavy, but I want to hold up an example of

753
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:05,788
a place that really did set itself up to

754
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:07,790
be something that people could return to

755
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,792
again and again and again.

756
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:13,796
And I don't think there's anything wrong

757
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:16,799
with aspiring to having that kind of

758
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,801
place, that kind of respect.

759
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:23,806
And I think that the things that you're

760
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:27,810
pointing to right now, hopefully we're

761
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,812
preparing properly.

762
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:33,816
So that's what I'm taking away at this

763
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:34,817
point.

764
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,821
Daniel: We know about that preparation

765
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:40,823
measurement cycle from Chris Fields, don'

766
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:41,824
't we?

767
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:41,824
Dean: Yeah.

768
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:46,828
Daniel: We go on, talk a little.

769
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
Oh, yeah.

770
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
Please, Pablo.

771
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:47,830
Pablo: Go.

772
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,831
No, no, definitely.

773
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:49,832
I completely agree.

774
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:52,835
I've been thinking about that for a long

775
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:53,836
time.

776
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:59,842
You want to build and act for the best of

777
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:03,840
the future, and I think to reflect that

778
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,843
on the paper, it's super important.

779
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:11,848
Yeah, definitely up to do that.

780
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:14,851
Daniel: Yeah, way ahead.

781
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,853
We describe some paths that we want to

782
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,855
take and the history of the Institute.

783
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:19,856
We describe our origins.

784
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:23,860
But I actually wanted to come to figure

785
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,864
three and four on page eleven to speak to

786
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,867
building one of the most amazing and

787
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:34,871
encouraging things has been the all ages,

788
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:38,875
all time zone, active build, contribute

789
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:39,876
mindset.

790
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:43,880
An earlier version of myself, I might

791
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,882
have thought, like people who do

792
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:47,884
variational Bayesian methods in machine

793
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:50,886
learning, they're going to have no issue

794
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,889
onboarding to active inference.

795
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,891
It's just going to be like as simple as

796
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:56,893
saying, yeah, it's a variational Bayesian

797
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:57,894
model with action.

798
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:59,896
So it's just signal processing on the

799
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
inbound.

800
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,892
It's just control theory on the outbound.

801
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:01,892
.

802
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,894
But if you're familiar with variational

803
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,896
Bayes and variational free energy, this

804
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:06,897
isn't changing it that much.

805
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,899
Oh, yeah, we use a particular partition

806
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:09,900
and it's related to the free energy

807
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,901
principle.

808
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:11,902
But don't worry too much, you'll get

809
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:12,903
there.

810
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:17,908
I thought that that would be the path for

811
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,912
so many and future analyses will reveal

812
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:25,916
what they do or don't reveal, but what we

813
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,920
found in our enacted work as it really

814
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,924
played out that there was inclusion and

815
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:37,928
unique contributions to conversations

816
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:41,932
ranging from philosophy of science to

817
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,935
fundamentals of statistics and

818
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,939
metascience and the role of quantitative

819
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:52,943
studies and social systems.

820
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:56,947
All these amazing topics and people who

821
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,950
just scampered so rapidly through what

822
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,948
could be seen as prerequisite from a

823
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:07,952
disciplinary perspective was facilitated

824
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:10,955
by the recognition that one was already

825
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:14,959
in the space and in the way that they

826
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:18,963
needed to be to be an active inference.

827
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:22,967
And that was not written out before and

828
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:25,970
even now the traces are barely recorded,

829
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,973
but it will become to be understood more

830
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:29,974
fully.

831
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:36,981
Dean: And to your point, Daniel, I think

832
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:40,985
especially what the pie chart shows is

833
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:43,988
the actual spectrum aspect of this.

834
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:47,992
So I know that right now that maybe the

835
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,995
neuroscience and the psychology piece

836
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:53,998
take up a bigger portion.

837
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,001
But I think one of the things that we're

838
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,003
trying to promote is the idea that you

839
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:01,000
can come from just about any background

840
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,003
as opposed to, oh, all paths lead to, as

841
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:07,006
you said, an earlier version of you said,

842
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:09,008
oh, okay, well, I can see where

843
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:11,010
everything is going to where the

844
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,013
confluence is going to.

845
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:18,017
No, I think what this demonstrates is

846
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:21,020
that it's actually becoming more

847
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,024
distributed the longer we continue to

848
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:26,025
exist.

849
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:30,029
Daniel: Yeah, this figure, of course, I'm

850
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,032
super happy with everything that we were

851
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:36,035
able to do, but this figure is almost a

852
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:39,038
little bit like a paper target that we're

853
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:41,040
just going to blow out later.

854
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,043
Because it was a fraction of only people

855
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:47,046
who had formal affiliations listed, which

856
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:49,048
means only people for whom we had done

857
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:52,050
full literature based pulling up their

858
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,052
information.

859
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:56,055
So it doesn't even represent the actual

860
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:59,058
participation profile.

861
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:02,055
This is more like the invitation list for

862
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:03,056
live streams.

863
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:08,061
So we are going to see another long tail

864
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:13,066
that covers the part that's not the long

865
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,067
tail.

866
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:18,071
I believe the rest of the paper continues

867
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:21,074
along possibilities, challenges, next

868
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:24,077
steps, more about the institute

869
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:27,080
organization, various other pieces of

870
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,084
information that potentially eager

871
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:34,087
stakeholders or participants or donors or

872
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:38,091
liaisons or other people would like to

873
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:40,093
learn more about.

874
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:42,095
It's there to engage with.

875
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:46,099
We want people to hop into our discord

876
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:49,102
and continue the conversation or email us

877
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:52,105
or otherwise get involved.

878
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:55,107
It's why we called this symposium

879
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:57,110
enacting Ecosystems of Shared

880
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,107
Intelligence at the, of course, relevant

881
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:03,110
suggestion of Karl Friston, because we

882
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,112
really do want to enact it.

883
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,114
So if you feel like you're on the

884
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:10,117
sideline waiting to jump in or you're on

885
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,119
the beach and people are out there

886
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,122
surfing the 100 foot wave, then maybe it'

887
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,124
's time to get more involved.

888
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:21,128
So I will leave the closing word first to

889
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:25,132
Dean, then Pablo, and then we'll go to

890
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:27,134
Raph's presentation.

891
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,138
Dean: Well, just real quick, again, if

892
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:34,141
you want a consolidated document that

893
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:37,144
speaks to the now but also points to a

894
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:40,147
direction that none of us really know is

895
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,150
certain, but is also really exciting,

896
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,152
have a look at the doc.

897
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:50,157
Daniel: Pablo?

898
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:53,160
Pablo: Yeah.

899
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,164
I'm here to make sure that I act as one

900
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:01,162
of those people of all backgrounds and

901
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:05,166
perspectives that has taken advantage

902
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:09,170
through one year of learning and working

903
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,174
on this institute, and hopefully see you

904
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:15,176
in 1 hour.

905
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:18,179
So thank you and have fun.

906
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Dean: Thanks.

907
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,181
Daniel: Awesome.

908
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:21,182
Thank you.

909
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:22,183
Thank you, Dean.

910
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:23,184
Thank you, Pablo.
