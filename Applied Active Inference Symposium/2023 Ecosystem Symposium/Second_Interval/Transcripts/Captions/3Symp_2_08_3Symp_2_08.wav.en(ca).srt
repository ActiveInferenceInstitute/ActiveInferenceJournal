1
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,846
All right. Welcome, Mahault. This will

2
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:28,634
be the final of the presentation

3
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,094
sessions in the symposium. This is

4
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,178
Mahault Abu Rasin with the presentation

5
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:38,218
shared pretensions in active inference.

6
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:41,040
So, thank you, Mahault, to you.

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,174
And you're the first to join with an

8
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,070
Aiststute guardian.

9
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,160
Awesome. Shall I share my screen? Yes.

10
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,970
Let'S do. Just a second.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,506
I'm looking for a window. I think this

12
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:05,818
will do. Okay, so can you

13
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,494
see the screen? Yes. Looks good. Thank

14
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:10,638
you. Awesome. So,

15
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,778
unfortunately, I imagine

16
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:18,314
that you are seeing the entire

17
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:20,178
screen and not just the presentation. I

18
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:22,606
apologize about that. I got it. It's

19
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:25,102
cropped. I got it. Okay, wonderful.

20
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,370
Thank you. All right,

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,274
so welcome to the presentation on Shared

22
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:33,938
Potential under Active Inference. We're

23
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:36,550
going to cover a lot of topics.

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,400
Shall I introduce myself a little bit,

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,680
or have you already done that?

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,686
Awesome. So, my name is Mawal Bahasa.

27
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:49,382
I'm a PhD student in cognitive

28
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:52,154
computing. I work in active inference in

29
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:55,690
the interaction between social sciences,

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,374
philosophy, consciousness, science, and

31
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:03,614
artificial intelligence. We're going to

32
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:06,686
start a presentation on potential and

33
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,106
active inference. So I'm going to define

34
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:10,660
a lot of terms. It's going to deal into

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,210
philosophy, terms that are very deep.

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,554
And so let's get started. If you will

37
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:20,260
just give me one small second.

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,686
And we're back. So, shared potential is

39
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,926
a term derived from phenomenology, and

40
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:35,374
it refers to the shared anticipation of

41
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,966
future events among a group of

42
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,834
individuals. This philosophical study of

43
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:43,086
experience and consciousness becomes

44
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:44,386
particularly interesting when we

45
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:47,006
consider it in the context of active

46
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:49,634
inference. When we combine these two

47
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:52,126
concepts, we get a powerful tool for

48
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:54,450
understanding how groups of individuals

49
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,982
can coordinate their actions and work

50
00:02:57,036 --> 00:03:00,054
towards a common goal. This is the main

51
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,974
focus of the discussion today. So

52
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:05,686
imagine a group of people planning

53
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,226
a trip. They all share a common goal to

54
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:12,170
have a successful and enjoyable trip.

55
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,402
This shared goal forms the basis of

56
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,414
their shared potential. They all

57
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,006
anticipate future events related to the

58
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,826
trip, such as booking tickets, packing

59
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,762
their bags, and visiting various

60
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:27,374
attractions. As they start to take

61
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,662
actions towards their goal, they're also

62
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,458
engaging in active inference. They're

63
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:33,922
making predictions about what will

64
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:36,034
happen next and then adjusting these

65
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,746
predictions based on what actually

66
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,506
happens. So, for example, they might

67
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:41,426
predict that a certain flight will be

68
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:42,902
the cheapest based on their past

69
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,062
experiences. But when they actually

70
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:47,510
check the prices, they find that another

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,694
flight is cheaper. So they adjust their

72
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,030
prediction and book the other flight.

73
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,654
This constant cycle of prediction and

74
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,414
adjustment, guided by their shared

75
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,526
potential, helps the group coordinate

76
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:01,018
their actions and make their trip a

77
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,374
success. So we're going to delve deeper

78
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:06,566
into the concepts and explore the role

79
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,226
of past experiences known as retentions

80
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:11,022
in shaping our current knowledge and

81
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,270
future predictions.

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,076
Let's explain first the concept of

83
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,904
retentions. Retention is a key component

84
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:28,544
of time consciousness that retains the

85
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:31,170
past trajectory of a temporal object.

86
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,136
It's the preservation of the content of

87
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:38,800
a now past hyletic datum in our

88
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,496
present consciousness. A highletic datum

89
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,608
refers to the raw,

90
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,844
uninterpreted sensations that arise in

91
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:51,480
our consciousness. When we retain these

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,136
data, we are essentially keeping a

93
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:57,032
record of past sensations and

94
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,480
experiences that can inform our present

95
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,000
and our future actions.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,824
In active inference, we can formalize

97
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,132
retention by thinking of moments as

98
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:10,364
binning of states which are bound to a

99
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,832
hierarchical state. This way, retention

100
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,336
is seen as the bidding which becomes the

101
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,752
current state, informing the next

102
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,872
expected state. To further connect

103
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:23,904
retention with active inference, we can

104
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:25,852
consider the way in which retention

105
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,896
plays a role in updating an agent's

106
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:31,252
belief and generative model. The past

107
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,332
experiences influence the current

108
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,368
expectations and actions, thus shaping

109
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:37,972
the agent's understanding of the world

110
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:41,428
and the future. So let's consider

111
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,752
a practical example to illustrate this

112
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:46,056
concept. If you had a good experience at

113
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,896
a particular restaurant, you might

114
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,690
choose to go there again in the future.

115
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,184
Your past experience influences your

116
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:55,304
future decision. In hostile temporal

117
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:57,292
phenomenology, we would think about much

118
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,164
shorter timescale. But if we extend this

119
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:02,312
concept, we can see a much larger

120
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,204
structure wherein the retention is

121
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:07,632
simply the past state. It's like having

122
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:09,744
a mental note that says this place is

123
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:12,064
good. And this is how an example of

124
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:14,050
retention works in your everyday life.

125
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,152
They're not merely representation or

126
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:20,496
memories, but presentations of a

127
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:23,572
temporarily extended present which

128
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:25,780
distinguishes them from recollections.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,212
This involves the presentation of some

130
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:31,044
already constituted content in conscious

131
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,328
experience. Retentions also play a

132
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,132
crucial role in mapping past knowledge

133
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,096
onto current beliefs, contributing to

134
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:40,744
the development of shared narratives or

135
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:43,164
goals that we will delve into in the

136
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,636
rest of the presentation. They can

137
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,052
be former now points and the current

138
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,964
awareness of the past and far.

139
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,552
Sedimented retentions can be engraved in

140
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:58,832
scripts or deep temporal priors or more

141
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:03,036
fluid deontic cues. This phenomenon

142
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,904
corresponds to a specific application of

143
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,516
message passing between agents in the

144
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,900
present moment and in the sensorium.

145
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,124
Retentions and protensions may also

146
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:18,868
emerge jointly within a group, forming a

147
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:20,476
collective understanding that transcends

148
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:21,960
individual perspectives.

149
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,860
Protensions, as we saw,

150
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,202
refer to the anticipation of future

151
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:34,142
events based on past experiences and

152
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,238
current knowledge. It's thus forward

153
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,902
looking. It's the forward looking

154
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,566
counterpart to retention which is

155
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:43,286
backward looking. Retention is the

156
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,926
anticipation of future trajectories of a

157
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:49,386
temporal object. It's the process of

158
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:51,962
looking ahead, predicting what's to come

159
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,074
based on what has been and what

160
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:56,966
currently is. So in active inference,

161
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,566
it could be formalized by considering

162
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,586
the future states that are expected

163
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:02,942
based on the current state and past

164
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:06,206
states. Protension is thus the

165
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,990
anticipation guiding the next action.

166
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,274
We can consider the way in which

167
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,466
protension plays a role in updating an

168
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,366
agent's beliefs and generative models

169
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,670
influencing the actions and thus shaping

170
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,970
the agent's understanding of the world

171
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,266
and the future. So for instance, if you

172
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,494
see Dark Cloud in the sky, you might

173
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,126
anticipate that it's going to rain and

174
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,302
decide to carry an umbrella. This

175
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:33,222
anticipation of future events is

176
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,874
potential. It's also going to determine

177
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,526
whether or not you're wet when you go

178
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,434
outside and therefore whether or not you

179
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:41,994
expect to be wet. Your brain is

180
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,354
constantly making predictions about

181
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:46,278
what's going to happen next. So let's

182
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:49,290
put this in the context of temporal flow

183
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,966
which ties together those concepts of

184
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:53,630
primal impressions and we will see

185
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,550
retention and protention.

186
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,254
Temporal flow is the structure that

187
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,554
represents the continuous progression of

188
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:05,970
time from the past through the present

189
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,220
and into the future.

190
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,346
Agents are constantly revising their

191
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,106
generative models and they do this by

192
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:15,526
integrating the observations which we

193
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,474
could refer to here as primal

194
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,902
impressions. This updating process

195
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,658
is a balancing act between maintaining

196
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,434
the predictive density of the agent's

197
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,294
current beliefs and adapting to new

198
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,334
information. Retentions and pretensions

199
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,282
structure time for a given agent

200
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,354
creating a framework that shapes their

201
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,370
perception and anticipation.

202
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,110
Different agents or systems will exhibit

203
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,846
varying qualities and quantities of

204
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,834
retention and potential which resembles

205
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:49,886
something like Mike Levin's concept of

206
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:52,366
cognitive light codes. So given the

207
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:54,458
presence of retention we can anticipate

208
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:58,370
a protentional horizon not merely as

209
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,290
an arbitrary expectation.

210
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,390
Are thus the point at which agents

211
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,822
beliefs about the world are updated to

212
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,814
match their current observations which

213
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,426
leads to a more accurate understanding

214
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,862
of the environment and allows for more

215
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:16,710
effective goal directed behavior.

216
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,774
Primal impressions are the fulfillment

217
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:23,510
of a potential which is the time bound

218
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,650
nexus of perception and existence.

219
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,382
It is the resolved probability that

220
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:34,350
redefines the local gradient.

221
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,434
It's in primal impression that reality

222
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:41,302
collapses. The primal impression is thus

223
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:44,030
modeled as the essential Bayesian

224
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,978
cognitive moment. It is the

225
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,322
juxtaposition of prior beliefs or

226
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:52,926
retention with ongoing sensory

227
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,818
information in an unfolding future

228
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,010
oriented present or retention.

229
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,306
So now we have a description of temporal

230
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:02,918
thickness from feminine ominnology which

231
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,626
is compatible with generative modeling

232
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:08,294
and active inference agents for

233
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,134
hospital. This flow of conscious

234
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:12,106
experience is primarily made up of

235
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,374
sensations that well up in a raw

236
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,122
uninterpreted form that we called

237
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,374
earlier hyletic data. So this data is

238
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,966
the now phase of a temporal object. It

239
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:25,086
is formatted according to the identic or

240
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:28,126
cognitive laws of consciousness. This is

241
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,320
specifically relative to inner time.

242
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,454
We can understand how temporal flow

243
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,674
structures how agents are able to make

244
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:41,858
choices, act to self evidence, connect

245
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:43,806
the passive structure with the active

246
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,586
component of decision making or goal

247
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:48,806
pursuit. Individuals have drives and

248
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,854
teleology insofar as they have

249
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,462
preferences. These preferences are

250
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:57,142
protented goals reached towards by

251
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,450
what we would call potentially the fiat

252
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,186
wherein the fiat constitutes the will to

253
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,286
act towards a desire. So the fulfillment

254
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:08,170
of a pretension by fiat drives the agent

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
towards a teleology across a trail set

256
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,902
in a retentional extension. More

257
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:17,630
information is amassed. So the longer

258
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,206
your retention, more information can be

259
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:23,966
caught in a moment. As individuals amass

260
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,914
enough information they can then find a

261
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,514
structure to the information which

262
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,150
becomes a map rather than a territory

263
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,166
and is computationally more efficient

264
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,598
than the sum of all the information

265
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:37,974
amassed. This new state

266
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,762
of information may lead individuals

267
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,278
closer to a shared goal. The information

268
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,406
amassed turns into an emergent whole of

269
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:47,674
the retention, which grabs focus

270
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,722
at the present moment because it seems

271
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:52,154
to bring signals to the model that the

272
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,506
potential goal is closer and is

273
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:56,570
computationally simpler to retain.

274
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,070
So sharing of retentions and potentials

275
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,102
among group members in a social context

276
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,826
can facilitate coordination and the

277
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,290
achievement of a shared goal.

278
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,558
By aligning their beliefs about the past

279
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:16,694
or retentions and expectations about the

280
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:20,054
future or potentials, group members can

281
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,662
better predict each other's actions and

282
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:25,914
intentions. This allows them to work

283
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,170
together more effectively.

284
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,314
In some cases, group members may have

285
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,022
retentions and potentials that align

286
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,922
naturally due to common experiences or

287
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,914
understanding. Even without active

288
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,766
communication, however, group members

289
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,942
often actively communicate their

290
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:47,658
retentions and protensions, aligning

291
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:50,410
their beliefs and expectations through

292
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,610
dialogue and interaction,

293
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,786
thereby enhancing their ability to

294
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:58,306
predict each other's actions and

295
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:02,462
intentions. Retentions and protensions

296
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,406
may also emerge jointly within the

297
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,598
group, not confined to any individual

298
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:09,362
agents, unvelt forming a collective

299
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:11,478
understanding that transcends individual

300
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,882
perspectives. This complex

301
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:17,046
interplay of individual and collective

302
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:19,434
dynamics can be explored further in

303
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,190
hierarchical generative models

304
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,518
encompassing resonant, cognitive models,

305
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,130
communication and even joint emergence.

306
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,422
The structure of time consciousness

307
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:34,674
encapsulated in retention and protension

308
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:37,502
thus plays a significant role in the

309
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:40,590
emergence of shared potentials.

310
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,730
As agents retain and process similar

311
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,586
elements from their environment, they

312
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:48,674
can cocompute shared potentials by

313
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,846
mapping each other's cognitive pathways

314
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,290
and building upon one another's trails.

315
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,074
This process is formalized by Bayesian

316
00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:00,598
updating the relationship between the

317
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:02,646
topology of protensions and the

318
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,886
expectation gradient, as well as the

319
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:06,810
role of retention in mapping past

320
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,306
knowledge on the current beliefs plays a

321
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,350
role in development of shared narratives

322
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,490
and goals.

323
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,366
We can use this to get a deeper insight

324
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,306
into the processes that drive the

325
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,306
emergence of collective behavior and the

326
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:22,566
development of shared understanding

327
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:26,126
among agents. There is no

328
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,738
better way to do it than using active

329
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:30,266
inference by extending generative models

330
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:32,014
of individual agents to account for the

331
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:34,980
beliefs and goals of other agents.

332
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,674
This is akin to theory of mind. It

333
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:40,866
enables them to anticipate and adapt to

334
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:43,006
the actions of their peers by offloading

335
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:47,954
to the group. So we

336
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,194
discussed a little bit's earlier shared

337
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,558
goals. Potential goals are

338
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:55,654
future oriented objectives that

339
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:58,246
individuals or groups strive to achieve.

340
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:01,066
They're not just mere desires, but

341
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:02,986
they're actively pursued through the act

342
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:05,270
of will that we called earlier fiat.

343
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,006
The fulfillment of a pretension drives

344
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:10,026
the agent towards a teleology that trail

345
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:13,326
set. We discussed the fulfillment of a

346
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,686
prediction entails less surprise and

347
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,862
therefore the agent self evidences. By

348
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,006
seeking to accurately predict their

349
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,826
surroundings, agents select a series of

350
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:26,094
actions or policies which generate

351
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,854
transitions between states that produce

352
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:30,146
expected observations. So through the

353
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,842
choice of policy, an individual can

354
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,798
reach their potented goal by minimizing

355
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:36,374
the expected free energy that a given

356
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,694
policy affords them. This seems pretty

357
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,706
central and simple in terms of active

358
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:43,494
inference. So farther potentials are

359
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:45,846
represented by the policies of longer

360
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:48,694
time death. In a hierarchical model,

361
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,506
this corresponds to a policy tied to a

362
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,054
higher level action in a slower

363
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:55,526
timescale. The choice of policies driven

364
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,226
by the expected free energy of that

365
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,754
higher order policy or the entire

366
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,846
multiscale generative model is based on

367
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,766
the agent's preferences, allowing an

368
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,674
agent to conduct gold directed behaviors

369
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,390
across temporal scales.

370
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,126
So this is where we can cash out Jeff

371
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,050
Yoshimi's trail sets where agents

372
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,462
assimilate actions into the anticipated

373
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,466
continuity of objects in their

374
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:23,490
surrounding world. This simulation

375
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,374
ensures a smoother understanding of the

376
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,226
environment and helps agents adapt

377
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:31,814
effectively. Near potentials act as

378
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,210
the near present contextual. Proximity

379
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,542
and the far pretensions rely on passive

380
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:38,906
synthesis of deontic cues which are

381
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,266
sedimented retentions in the

382
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:44,342
environment. The preferences

383
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,278
of the agents aligned by policies

384
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,838
correspond to attracting sets which in

385
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:50,974
the sociocognitive setting can be

386
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:53,902
instantiated as narratives. Having

387
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,554
shared narrative is a necessary aspect

388
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,314
of any exchange between artifacts,

389
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,766
people, institutions that have some kind

390
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:05,134
of attracting set generalized

391
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:06,626
synchrony which we will discuss a little

392
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:10,306
bit later as well. So a team working on

393
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:12,466
a project has a potential goal to

394
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:15,906
complete the project successfully. The

395
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,382
shared narrative might be the project

396
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:19,778
plan that guides their actions. It's

397
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,266
like everyone in the team has a shared

398
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,806
story about what they're trying to

399
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:25,080
achieve and how they're going to do it.

400
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,370
The relationship between current states

401
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,446
and future observations is captured

402
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,954
within the B matrix transitions. This

403
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:36,954
matrix represents the probability of

404
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,386
transitioning to a new state based on

405
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:41,434
the current state. So the B matrix

406
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:44,906
transition and the A matrix is utilized

407
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,446
to determine which new observations is

408
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,982
most likely to occur given the current

409
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:51,550
state and potential transitions. In the

410
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,694
Cerulean framework, the expectation

411
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:56,046
gradient structure plays a crucial role

412
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:58,626
in defining the depth and fulfillment of

413
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:01,822
pretensions. This structure

414
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:03,794
represents the varying degrees of

415
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:06,934
certainty and confidence agents have

416
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:08,342
in their predictions about future

417
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:12,646
states. The topology thus and

418
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:14,354
the arrangements is interrelation.

419
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:17,414
Sorry. There is an interrelation between

420
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,446
the potentials or the arrangements of

421
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:21,386
future expectations which is

422
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:22,774
proportional to the expectation

423
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:25,466
gradient. The higher the gradient, the

424
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:26,698
more detailed and accurate the

425
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:30,366
potentials are likely to be. The

426
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:32,334
potential horizon represents thus the

427
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,198
static states of the expected futures of

428
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:36,526
the temporal object while the

429
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:39,210
continuation horizon is the amalgamated

430
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,158
trail of the temporal object. Potential

431
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:46,050
and continuation horizons are carried in

432
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,686
protensions while the imminent horizon

433
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:50,690
consists of the primal impressions.

434
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,022
So agents can coordinate through

435
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:58,806
coconstruction where agents or

436
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,414
individuals interact and collaborate to

437
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:03,046
build this shared understanding and

438
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,322
shared goals. This process is deeply

439
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:09,242
interconnected within a complex web

440
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,354
where agents typically coexist with

441
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:15,174
other agents or subjects forming

442
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:17,226
a collective often referred to as

443
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,866
multiagent groups, swarm ensembles or

444
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:23,166
Samblage. By aligning their beliefs to

445
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,086
the signal found within their niche they

446
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,926
can better adapt to the environment and

447
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:28,686
develop a shared understanding of their

448
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,630
surroundings.

449
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,774
Sharing information with other agents is

450
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,474
beneficial as it allows them to trust

451
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:37,570
one another and pool their resources.

452
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,274
This collaborative approach is

453
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:42,046
preferable to a conflict driven scenario

454
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:43,966
in which every other agent is perceived

455
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,606
as a potential source of risk and

456
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:48,230
surprising. By sharing information

457
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,166
agents could collectively construct a

458
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,846
more accurate representation of their

459
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,874
environment leading to more effective

460
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,790
decision making and action. Through

461
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,674
these interactions, shared narratives

462
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,086
and goals can emerge from a

463
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,234
coconstruction of the world and each

464
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:05,002
agent's generative model. So these

465
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,714
narratives and goals are the result of

466
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:09,114
dynamic process that in fact can be

467
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:11,194
mathematically modeled through the

468
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,598
equations that we introduce in the paper

469
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:15,566
that this presentation is based on but

470
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,040
that I will present a little bit later.

471
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,834
They capture the process of mutual

472
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,806
learning where agents adapt their

473
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:23,026
generative model based on the

474
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,674
information gathered from their

475
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:28,114
interactions with others. Agents may

476
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,806
start off with slightly or greatly

477
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:32,434
divergent generative model. So in order

478
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:34,498
to minimize surprise there will be a

479
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,366
natural alignment within a group as

480
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,678
agents adapt to the evolving dynamics of

481
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:40,790
their environment and social contexts.

482
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,054
For example, again, consider this team

483
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,406
working on the project. Even if you have

484
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,166
your own understanding of the model or

485
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:50,282
of the project you'll interact and share

486
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:52,090
information and learn from each other

487
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,634
and then adapt the model. Over time,

488
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:56,586
you'll develop a shared understanding of

489
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,314
the project and a shared goal for its

490
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,386
completion. This is an instance of

491
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:03,886
coconstruction. It's like building a

492
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:04,990
house together where everyone

493
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,526
contributes to the final structure. The

494
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:10,446
emergence of shared narratives and the

495
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:12,298
learning and recognition of them may be

496
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:14,322
made more efficient through certain

497
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,826
mechanisms such as language. In an

498
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:21,940
experiment illustrated in a paper that

499
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,114
Karl Rozan two agents share the same

500
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:28,038
sensorium ask each other's questions. I

501
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,558
think it's a paper on 20 questions and

502
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:32,034
Emma Holmes with a shared narrative

503
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,774
entailing a common language. This

504
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,358
illustrates the marked efficiency and

505
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:37,798
the minimization of free energy simply

506
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,690
by having a shared language, a common

507
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,286
ground. So shared

508
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,810
potentials are common future

509
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,654
anticipations or goals that emerge among

510
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:48,874
groups of individuals through

511
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:51,566
coconstruction. It allows them to better

512
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,086
anticipate each other's actions and

513
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:54,782
intentions and work towards a common

514
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:58,046
goal. It's strongly tied to

515
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,966
the conscious efforts of individuals to

516
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:02,546
work towards that goal and to

517
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:04,654
effectively create an organizational

518
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:06,946
structures where we're engaged in a

519
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,886
conversation in an exchange assuming

520
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:12,354
that this exchange is meant to align our

521
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,378
generative models. So think of for

522
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:17,586
instance, a football team. Again, they

523
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,206
have a shared potential to win the

524
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:20,866
match. They anticipate each other's

525
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:22,486
moves and adapt their strategies based

526
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,838
on the ongoing game. Everyone in the

527
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:26,806
team has a shared vision of victory and

528
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:28,154
they're constantly adjusting their

529
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,660
actions to make it happen.

530
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,406
So individuals infer each other's mental

531
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,586
states by observing cues which they can

532
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,682
attribute to hidden causes. They use

533
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:41,646
their own model or models that they have

534
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:44,014
learned to recognize about others. This

535
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:45,274
process is known as generalized

536
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:47,066
synchrony entailing mutual

537
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:49,178
predictability, and can be interpreted

538
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,734
as a collective minimization of free

539
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:54,234
energy. In a group setting,

540
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,826
individuals create cues in the world

541
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,966
that direct other agents attentions

542
00:23:57,998 --> 00:24:00,558
towards the same signals. Their models

543
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:02,162
of the world align by sharing similar

544
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:04,514
goals and similar environments and by

545
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:06,434
reinforcing patterns of sampling

546
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:09,926
reality. So we

547
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,462
could try to represent this through

548
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:15,746
polynomials and morphisms. Each agent's

549
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:16,914
interaction with the environment

550
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,698
corresponds to a morphism, and the

551
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,346
collective interaction of all agents can

552
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,330
be represented as a polynomial.

553
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,954
So if a polynomial p

554
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:29,226
is defined, morphism between two

555
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:31,330
polynomials, p and q, consists of a pair

556
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,602
of functions, f and g, such that f maps

557
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:38,366
p of one to q of one and

558
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:41,342
g maps P of I to q of the quantity one.

559
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:43,106
This morphism must satisfy the

560
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:44,946
commutative requirements, meaning that

561
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:50,626
the following diagram commutes p

562
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:52,706
of I maps to q of the quantity I and p

563
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:56,086
of one maps to q of one. So we could

564
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,054
see how we could create a framework to

565
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:00,566
further explore the cooperative and

566
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:03,062
competitive dynamics among agents. For

567
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:05,254
multiple agents indexed by I with

568
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:07,410
boundaries p and share environment

569
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,106
boundary q, their interaction can be

570
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:11,386
represented by a morphism of

571
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:13,626
polynomials, which allows us to

572
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,194
understand the shared potential in

573
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:16,858
multiagent systems and provides a

574
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:18,506
foundation for further exploration of

575
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:20,170
cooperative dynamics.

576
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,974
We allow each agent to predict not only

577
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:26,746
its own behavior, but also the behavior

578
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,666
of its companions and the environment's

579
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:32,706
response to their actions. So the

580
00:25:32,728 --> 00:25:34,786
dynamics of shared predictions are

581
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:36,606
really useful here and can be properly

582
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:40,594
cashed out mathematically through

583
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:43,154
recursive cognition and prediction on

584
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:45,486
the shared environment of the agent's

585
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:47,134
actions and response to each other's

586
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:50,818
actions. We can use sheep's theoretic

587
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,486
and topos theoretical approaches to

588
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:54,626
understand multi agent systems. A multi

589
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,546
agent system is a system where multiple

590
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,726
individuals or entities interact. So for

591
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:00,266
example, a traffic system can be

592
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:01,866
considered a multi agent system where

593
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:05,658
different vehicles interact. A topos is

594
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,514
a category that has both spatial and

595
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:09,466
logical structure, allowing for the

596
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:11,386
expression of logical propositions and

597
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:13,406
deductions within it. So we can use

598
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:15,434
these approaches to construct a coherent

599
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:16,878
understanding of the world from the

600
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:19,566
perspective of multiple agents. The

601
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:21,326
internal universe of agents, which can

602
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:22,990
be seen as mathematical objects

603
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,994
containing beliefs, perceptions and

604
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:27,074
predictions of individual agents, are

605
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:29,170
represented using topoi.

606
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,586
These internal universes provide a

607
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,286
foundation for understanding and

608
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,914
representing the complex interactions

609
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,514
and shared understanding among multiple

610
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:41,030
agents in this dynamic environment.

611
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,934
We try to construct a consensus topos by

612
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:47,026
patching together the internal universes

613
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:50,118
or topoi of multiple agents. And the

614
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:51,846
idea is to use the sheep theoretic and

615
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,418
topos theoretic structures to build a

616
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:54,650
shared understanding.

617
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,348
So we can thus derive the

618
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:01,152
synchronization of goal oriented actions

619
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,024
among agents over time and leverage

620
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,576
mathematical insights for category

621
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,404
theory and generalized generative

622
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:09,972
models. This connection is the mechanism

623
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,276
through which the group synchronizes

624
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,184
over time and ultimately achieves their

625
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,780
objective. Agents within the system

626
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,444
might possess varying levels of

627
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:20,344
certainty in achieving the objective.

628
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,348
Some may choose to expend less energy,

629
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,632
temporarily decelerating their progress

630
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:26,764
towards the desired outcome. This

631
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:28,516
variation in certainty and approach

632
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:29,872
leads to the emergence of different

633
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:32,240
roles within a group, with some agents

634
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,144
focusing on computational tasks while

635
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:35,936
other monitor outcomes or engage in

636
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,796
different actions themselves. The nested

637
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,364
and distributed structure of generative

638
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:42,036
models in active inference allows for

639
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:43,924
the integration of both short term and

640
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,756
long term goals. Agents with similar

641
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:49,136
compatible preferences can coordinate

642
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,880
their actions by aligning their policies

643
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,220
and working towards common narratives.

644
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,504
So this alignment reduces the overall

645
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,284
expected free energy of their joint

646
00:27:57,332 --> 00:27:58,936
actions, increasing the likelihood of

647
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,044
achieving shared goals and facilitating

648
00:28:01,092 --> 00:28:02,516
the sharing of goals and expectation

649
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,690
among group members.

650
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,556
They can learn, which allows them to

651
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,940
learn essential role in shaping agents

652
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,990
preferences and strategies. Over time,

653
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,756
agents can gather new experiences and

654
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,264
update their generative model. They

655
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:19,008
refine their preferences and methods for

656
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,856
achieving goals. They can influence the

657
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:23,436
formation and modification of shared

658
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,024
narratives by having different

659
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:26,768
perspective over different parts of a

660
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:29,650
goal. Here,

661
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,196
the concept of generalized synchrony is

662
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:33,936
manifested when all agents have learned

663
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,036
compatible or harmonized aspects of the

664
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:37,796
overall generative model. The

665
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,428
synchronization is rooted in the

666
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,236
retentional and potential dynamics of

667
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:42,884
agents and can be more accurately

668
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:45,000
described using mathematical models.

669
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,336
So, in conclusion, we tried to shed

670
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:53,112
light on the concept of shared potential

671
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,576
goals and multiagent systems. We've

672
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,716
emphasized the importance of

673
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,288
understanding this concept as it plays a

674
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:59,804
crucial role in the coordination

675
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:01,584
synchronization of agents actions and

676
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:04,976
intentions. We in the future

677
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,084
continuously highlight the role of cues

678
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,056
in the environment and how they can be

679
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:10,976
simple like marks on the road or more

680
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:13,456
complex like symbols and language. The

681
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:14,944
queues become carriers of passive

682
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:16,804
synthesis, far pretensions and far

683
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,704
retention, and become ways to minimize

684
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:20,244
free energy as they minimize the amount

685
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:23,304
of any individual has to compute. It

686
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:25,316
also allows us to delve into the concept

687
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,176
of other evidencing in which the

688
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,416
environment is in effect the self and

689
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:34,744
others must learn to navigate

690
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,510
in terms of others and self.

691
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,396
We've provided mathematical models to an

692
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:42,168
equations to analyze dynamics of shared

693
00:29:42,184 --> 00:29:43,868
potentials more accurately. In terms of

694
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:46,876
category theory, we've explored the

695
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:48,396
dynamics of shared retentions and

696
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:49,932
potentials in hierarchical generative

697
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,564
models which reflect the complex

698
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:53,084
interplay of individual and collective

699
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:56,336
dynamics. We've encapsulated the

700
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,576
structure of time consciousness and how

701
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:00,768
this allows agents to co compute shared

702
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:02,128
potentials by mapping each other's

703
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:03,380
cognitive pathways.

704
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,164
So our approach basically begins an

705
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:10,668
examination of hospital temporal

706
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,616
phenomenology integrated with a

707
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,264
hierarchical active inference model,

708
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,808
polynomial morphisms and home

709
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:19,316
polynomials. This enables recursive

710
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:21,256
cognition and prediction of not only an

711
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,856
agent's actions, but also the

712
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:25,000
environment's response to these actions.

713
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,184
So I think this comes to the end,

714
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,264
Daniel. I think I'm literally at 30

715
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:32,650
minutes. Thank you,

716
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,770
impeccable. Thank you, Mahault it.

717
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,244
Yeah, great presentation. Awesome topic.

718
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,744
So thank you for joining and looking

719
00:30:43,782 --> 00:30:45,468
forward to seeing how the work continues

720
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:46,210
to develop.
