1
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:19,090
Daniel: All right.

2
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,318
Welcome, Mahault.

3
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:26,709
This will be the final of the

4
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:31,230
presentation sessions in the symposium.

5
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:34,508
This is Mahault Albarracin with the

6
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:36,769
presentation “Shared protentions in

7
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,918
active inference.”

8
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:41,199
So, thank you, Mahault, to you.

9
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,736
And you're the first to join with an AI

10
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:48,902
Steward/Guardian.

11
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:50,170
Mahault: Awesome.

12
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:52,329
Shall I share my screen?

13
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:53,410
Daniel: Yes.

14
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,708
Mahault: Let's do.

15
00:00:58,897 --> 00:00:58,991
Just a second.

16
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:00,597
I'm looking for a window.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,833
I think this will do.

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,171
Okay, so can you see the screen?

19
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:07,270
Daniel: Yes.

20
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:08,324
Looks good.

21
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:09,420
Thank you.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,490
Mahault: Awesome.

23
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:14,922
So, unfortunately, I imagine that you are

24
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:18,344
seeing the entire screen and not just the

25
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,499
presentation.

26
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:21,624
I apologize about that.

27
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:22,714
Daniel: I got it.

28
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:23,803
It's cropped.

29
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:23,894
I got it.

30
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:25,007
Mahault: Okay, wonderful.

31
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,099
Thank you.

32
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:30,547
All right, so welcome to the presentation

33
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:32,780
on Shared Potential under Active

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,868
Inference.

35
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:36,151
We're going to cover a lot of topics.

36
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:40,548
Shall I introduce myself a little bit, or

37
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,763
have you already done that?

38
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:44,977
Awesome.

39
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:46,016
So, my name is Mawal Bahasa.

40
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:50,050
I'm a PhD student in cognitive computing.

41
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,050
.

42
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:52,077
I work in active inference in the

43
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:55,106
interaction between social sciences,

44
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:58,137
philosophy, consciousness, science, and

45
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,099
artificial intelligence.

46
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:05,142
We're going to start a presentation on

47
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:07,162
potential and active inference.

48
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:08,179
So I'm going to define a lot of terms.

49
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,215
It's going to deal into philosophy, terms

50
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,231
that are very deep.

51
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:17,259
And so let's get started.

52
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,292
If you will just give me one small second.

53
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:20,292
.

54
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,379
And we're back.

55
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,407
So, shared potential is a term derived

56
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,434
from phenomenology, and it refers to the

57
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:36,458
shared anticipation of future events

58
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,479
among a group of individuals.

59
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,504
This philosophical study of experience

60
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:43,527
and consciousness becomes particularly

61
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:46,549
interesting when we consider it in the

62
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,568
context of active inference.

63
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,596
When we combine these two concepts, we

64
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:53,623
get a powerful tool for understanding how

65
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,646
groups of individuals can coordinate

66
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:58,672
their actions and work towards a common

67
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,678
goal.

68
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,642
This is the main focus of the discussion

69
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:01,646
today.

70
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:05,688
So imagine a group of people planning a

71
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:06,694
trip.

72
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:09,727
They all share a common goal to have a

73
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:12,751
successful and enjoyable trip.

74
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:15,787
This shared goal forms the basis of their

75
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,801
shared potential.

76
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,830
They all anticipate future events related

77
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,853
to the trip, such as booking tickets,

78
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,877
packing their bags, and visiting various

79
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:25,886
attractions.

80
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,915
As they start to take actions towards

81
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:30,937
their goal, they're also engaging in

82
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:31,949
active inference.

83
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,969
They're making predictions about what

84
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:36,990
will happen next and then adjusting these

85
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,007
predictions based on what actually

86
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,012
happens.

87
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,033
So, for example, they might predict that

88
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,051
a certain flight will be the cheapest

89
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:43,068
based on their past experiences.

90
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,095
But when they actually check the prices,

91
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:49,121
they find that another flight is cheaper.

92
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,122
.

93
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,148
So they adjust their prediction and book

94
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,159
the other flight.

95
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:55,182
This constant cycle of prediction and

96
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,200
adjustment, guided by their shared

97
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,220
potential, helps the group coordinate

98
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,179
their actions and make their trip a

99
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,185
success.

100
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:05,220
So we're going to delve deeper into the

101
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,241
concepts and explore the role of past

102
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,260
experiences known as retentions in

103
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,283
shaping our current knowledge and future

104
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,292
predictions.

105
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:22,394
Let's explain first the concept of

106
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,401
retentions.

107
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:26,430
Retention is a key component of time

108
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,456
consciousness that retains the past

109
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:31,481
trajectory of a temporal object.

110
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:35,526
It's the preservation of the content of a

111
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,557
now past hyletic datum in our present

112
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:40,571
consciousness.

113
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:44,610
A highletic datum refers to the raw,

114
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,643
uninterpreted sensations that arise in

115
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,660
our consciousness.

116
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,694
When we retain these data, we are

117
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:55,720
essentially keeping a record of past

118
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,746
sensations and experiences that can

119
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:00,717
inform our present and our future actions.

120
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,719
.

121
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,762
In active inference, we can formalize

122
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:07,786
retention by thinking of moments as

123
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,812
binning of states which are bound to a

124
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:11,826
hierarchical state.

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,856
This way, retention is seen as the

126
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,885
bidding which becomes the current state,

127
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,911
informing the next expected state.

128
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,942
To further connect retention with active

129
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:25,963
inference, we can consider the way in

130
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:27,985
which retention plays a role in updating

131
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,009
an agent's belief and generative model.

132
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,037
The past experiences influence the

133
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:35,061
current expectations and actions, thus

134
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:37,086
shaping the agent's understanding of the

135
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,101
world and the future.

136
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:43,139
So let's consider a practical example to

137
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,156
illustrate this concept.

138
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,172
If you had a good experience at a

139
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,190
particular restaurant, you might choose

140
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,206
to go there again in the future.

141
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,233
Your past experience influences your

142
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,244
future decision.

143
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,267
In hostile temporal phenomenology, we

144
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,291
would think about much shorter timescale.

145
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:58,291
.

146
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,262
But if we extend this concept, we can see

147
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,287
a much larger structure wherein the

148
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,314
retention is simply the past state.

149
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:09,341
It's like having a mental note that says

150
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,352
this place is good.

151
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,374
And this is how an example of retention

152
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,390
works in your everyday life.

153
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:17,425
They're not merely representation or

154
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:20,450
memories, but presentations of a

155
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,476
temporarily extended present which

156
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,507
distinguishes them from recollections.

157
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,534
This involves the presentation of some

158
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:30,558
already constituted content in conscious

159
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,566
experience.

160
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,603
Retentions also play a crucial role in

161
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,623
mapping past knowledge onto current

162
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:39,647
beliefs, contributing to the development

163
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,669
of shared narratives or goals that we

164
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,689
will delve into in the rest of the

165
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:45,700
presentation.

166
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:48,739
They can be former now points and the

167
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,769
current awareness of the past and far.

168
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:55,804
Sedimented retentions can be engraved in

169
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:58,838
scripts or deep temporal priors or more

170
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:00,796
fluid deontic cues.

171
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,837
This phenomenon corresponds to a specific

172
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:07,863
application of message passing between

173
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:10,890
agents in the present moment and in the

174
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:10,898
sensorium.

175
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,934
Retentions and protensions may also

176
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,962
emerge jointly within a group, forming a

177
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,990
collective understanding that transcends

178
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,009
individual perspectives.

179
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:28,073
Protensions, as we saw, refer to the

180
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,106
anticipation of future events based on

181
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:35,142
past experiences and current knowledge.

182
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:37,166
It's thus forward looking.

183
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,187
It's the forward looking counterpart to

184
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:41,205
retention which is backward looking.

185
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,237
Retention is the anticipation of future

186
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:47,260
trajectories of a temporal object.

187
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,292
It's the process of looking ahead,

188
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,318
predicting what's to come based on what

189
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:55,341
has been and what currently is.

190
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:57,366
So in active inference, it could be

191
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:59,386
formalized by considering the future

192
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,347
states that are expected based on the

193
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,365
current state and past states.

194
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,403
Protension is thus the anticipation

195
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,419
guiding the next action.

196
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:12,457
We can consider the way in which

197
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:15,480
protension plays a role in updating an

198
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,503
agent's beliefs and generative models

199
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,527
influencing the actions and thus shaping

200
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:22,551
the agent's understanding of the world

201
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:23,563
and the future.

202
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,592
So for instance, if you see Dark Cloud in

203
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,612
the sky, you might anticipate that it's

204
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,631
going to rain and decide to carry an

205
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:30,637
umbrella.

206
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,663
This anticipation of future events is

207
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,670
potential.

208
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:36,692
It's also going to determine whether or

209
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,711
not you're wet when you go outside and

210
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,733
therefore whether or not you expect to be

211
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:40,736
wet.

212
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:42,755
Your brain is constantly making

213
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,773
predictions about what's going to happen

214
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:44,776
next.

215
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,809
So let's put this in the context of

216
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,835
temporal flow which ties together those

217
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:53,860
concepts of primal impressions and we

218
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,884
will see retention and protention.

219
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,870
Temporal flow is the structure that

220
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,898
represents the continuous progression of

221
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,925
time from the past through the present

222
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,942
and into the future.

223
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,982
Agents are constantly revising their

224
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:13,005
generative models and they do this by

225
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:15,027
integrating the observations which we

226
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:18,052
could refer to here as primal impressions.

227
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:18,054
.

228
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:21,086
This updating process is a balancing act

229
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:23,103
between maintaining the predictive

230
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,121
density of the agent's current beliefs

231
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,138
and adapting to new information.

232
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:31,185
Retentions and pretensions structure time

233
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:34,211
for a given agent creating a framework

234
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,232
that shapes their perception and

235
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:37,243
anticipation.

236
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,280
Different agents or systems will exhibit

237
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,306
varying qualities and quantities of

238
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:46,335
retention and potential which resembles

239
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,364
something like Mike Levin's concept of

240
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:51,383
cognitive light codes.

241
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,416
So given the presence of retention we can

242
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,444
anticipate a protentional horizon not

243
00:09:57,444 --> 00:10:00,412
merely as an arbitrary expectation.

244
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:04,458
Are thus the point at which agents

245
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,482
beliefs about the world are updated to

246
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,505
match their current observations which

247
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:12,531
leads to a more accurate understanding of

248
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,553
the environment and allows for more

249
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,576
effective goal directed behavior.

250
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,620
Primal impressions are the fulfillment of

251
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,652
a potential which is the time bound nexus

252
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:26,676
of perception and existence.

253
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,733
It is the resolved probability that

254
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,753
redefines the local gradient.

255
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,786
It's in primal impression that reality

256
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:38,793
collapses.

257
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:42,832
The primal impression is thus modeled as

258
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:45,862
the essential Bayesian cognitive moment.

259
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,901
It is the juxtaposition of prior beliefs

260
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,927
or retention with ongoing sensory

261
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:54,953
information in an unfolding future

262
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,979
oriented present or retention.

263
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,960
So now we have a description of temporal

264
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,986
thickness from feminine ominnology which

265
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,011
is compatible with generative modeling

266
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,037
and active inference agents for hospital.

267
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:08,039
.

268
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,062
This flow of conscious experience is

269
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:13,086
primarily made up of sensations that well

270
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,108
up in a raw uninterpreted form that we

271
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,127
called earlier hyletic data.

272
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:20,154
So this data is the now phase of a

273
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:21,165
temporal object.

274
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,194
It is formatted according to the identic

275
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:26,218
or cognitive laws of consciousness.

276
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:29,249
This is specifically relative to inner

277
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:30,252
time.

278
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,301
We can understand how temporal flow

279
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,327
structures how agents are able to make

280
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:40,354
choices, act to self evidence, connect

281
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,379
the passive structure with the active

282
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,405
component of decision making or goal

283
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,414
pursuit.

284
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,444
Individuals have drives and teleology

285
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:51,466
insofar as they have preferences.

286
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,499
These preferences are protented goals

287
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,525
reached towards by what we would call

288
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,493
potentially the fiat wherein the fiat

289
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,519
constitutes the will to act towards a

290
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,527
desire.

291
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,564
So the fulfillment of a pretension by

292
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:10,598
fiat drives the agent towards a teleology

293
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,627
across a trail set in a retentional

294
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:14,638
extension.

295
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,660
More information is amassed.

296
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,681
So the longer your retention, more

297
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:21,705
information can be caught in a moment.

298
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,737
As individuals amass enough information

299
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:27,760
they can then find a structure to the

300
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,783
information which becomes a map rather

301
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,807
than a territory and is computationally

302
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,830
more efficient than the sum of all the

303
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,845
information amassed.

304
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,883
This new state of information may lead

305
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,905
individuals closer to a shared goal.

306
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,930
The information amassed turns into an

307
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,954
emergent whole of the retention, which

308
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:49,980
grabs focus at the present moment because

309
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,004
it seems to bring signals to the model

310
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,030
that the potential goal is closer and is

311
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,055
computationally simpler to retain.

312
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,053
So sharing of retentions and potentials

313
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:05,082
among group members in a social context

314
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:07,108
can facilitate coordination and the

315
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:10,132
achievement of a shared goal.

316
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,168
By aligning their beliefs about the past

317
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,198
or retentions and expectations about the

318
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:19,227
future or potentials, group members can

319
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:22,256
better predict each other's actions and

320
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,267
intentions.

321
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:27,301
This allows them to work together more

322
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:28,311
effectively.

323
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,354
In some cases, group members may have

324
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,376
retentions and potentials that align

325
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:37,399
naturally due to common experiences or

326
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,410
understanding.

327
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,438
Even without active communication,

328
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,466
however, group members often actively

329
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,491
communicate their retentions and

330
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,521
protensions, aligning their beliefs and

331
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,547
expectations through dialogue and

332
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,575
interaction, thereby enhancing their

333
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,605
ability to predict each other's actions

334
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:59,622
and intentions.

335
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,594
Retentions and protensions may also

336
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,617
emerge jointly within the group, not

337
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:07,644
confined to any individual agents, unvelt

338
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,669
forming a collective understanding that

339
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:12,694
transcends individual perspectives.

340
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:16,733
This complex interplay of individual and

341
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,756
collective dynamics can be explored

342
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:21,784
further in hierarchical generative models

343
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:24,811
encompassing resonant, cognitive models,

344
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:27,841
communication and even joint emergence.

345
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,894
The structure of time consciousness

346
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,924
encapsulated in retention and protension

347
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,950
thus plays a significant role in the

348
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,975
emergence of shared potentials.

349
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,007
As agents retain and process similar

350
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,035
elements from their environment, they can

351
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:49,061
cocompute shared potentials by mapping

352
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,085
each other's cognitive pathways and

353
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:54,112
building upon one another's trails.

354
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:57,142
This process is formalized by Bayesian

355
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,166
updating the relationship between the

356
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,127
topology of protensions and the

357
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:04,153
expectation gradient, as well as the role

358
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,180
of retention in mapping past knowledge on

359
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,203
the current beliefs plays a role in

360
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,226
development of shared narratives and

361
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,234
goals.

362
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,280
We can use this to get a deeper insight

363
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,297
into the processes that drive the

364
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,318
emergence of collective behavior and the

365
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,339
development of shared understanding among

366
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:23,345
agents.

367
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:27,385
There is no better way to do it than

368
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,405
using active inference by extending

369
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,429
generative models of individual agents to

370
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:34,449
account for the beliefs and goals of

371
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:34,459
other agents.

372
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,491
This is akin to theory of mind.

373
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,515
It enables them to anticipate and adapt

374
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,533
to the actions of their peers by

375
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,548
offloading to the group.

376
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,605
So we discussed a little bit's earlier

377
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:50,618
shared goals.

378
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,650
Potential goals are future oriented

379
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,677
objectives that individuals or groups

380
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:58,691
strive to achieve.

381
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:00,658
They're not just mere desires, but they'

382
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:03,682
're actively pursued through the act of

383
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:05,702
will that we called earlier fiat.

384
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,726
The fulfillment of a pretension drives

385
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,749
the agent towards a teleology that trail

386
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:10,752
set.

387
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,778
We discussed the fulfillment of a

388
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:15,806
prediction entails less surprise and

389
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:18,835
therefore the agent self evidences.

390
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,858
By seeking to accurately predict their

391
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,882
surroundings, agents select a series of

392
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,903
actions or policies which generate

393
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,927
transitions between states that produce

394
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,943
expected observations.

395
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,962
So through the choice of policy, an

396
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:33,984
individual can reach their potented goal

397
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,004
by minimizing the expected free energy

398
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:37,022
that a given policy affords them.

399
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:39,047
This seems pretty central and simple in

400
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,064
terms of active inference.

401
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,095
So farther potentials are represented by

402
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:47,119
the policies of longer time death.

403
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,145
In a hierarchical model, this corresponds

404
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:51,167
to a policy tied to a higher level action

405
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,179
in a slower timescale.

406
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:55,207
The choice of policies driven by the

407
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:58,234
expected free energy of that higher order

408
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,196
policy or the entire multiscale

409
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:03,222
generative model is based on the agent's

410
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,249
preferences, allowing an agent to conduct

411
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,275
gold directed behaviors across temporal

412
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:09,283
scales.

413
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:13,327
So this is where we can cash out Jeff

414
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,348
Yoshimi's trail sets where agents

415
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:18,373
assimilate actions into the anticipated

416
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:20,392
continuity of objects in their

417
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:21,405
surrounding world.

418
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,433
This simulation ensures a smoother

419
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,459
understanding of the environment and

420
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,482
helps agents adapt effectively.

421
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:32,514
Near potentials act as the near present

422
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:33,523
contextual.

423
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,548
Proximity and the far pretensions rely on

424
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,572
passive synthesis of deontic cues which

425
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:40,591
are sedimented retentions in the

426
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:41,600
environment.

427
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,651
The preferences of the agents aligned by

428
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,676
policies correspond to attracting sets

429
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,701
which in the sociocognitive setting can

430
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,722
be instantiated as narratives.

431
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,750
Having shared narrative is a necessary

432
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,778
aspect of any exchange between artifacts,

433
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,745
people, institutions that have some kind

434
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:04,772
of attracting set generalized synchrony

435
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,799
which we will discuss a little bit later

436
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,808
as well.

437
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,841
So a team working on a project has a

438
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,864
potential goal to complete the project

439
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:14,873
successfully.

440
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,905
The shared narrative might be the project

441
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,920
plan that guides their actions.

442
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,941
It's like everyone in the team has a

443
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,961
shared story about what they're trying to

444
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,980
achieve and how they're going to do it.

445
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,002
The relationship between current states

446
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,004
and future observations is captured

447
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,006
within the B matrix transitions.

448
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,009
This matrix represents the probability of

449
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:39,012
transitioning to a new state based on the

450
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,013
current state.

451
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:42,015
So the B matrix transition and the A

452
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:44,017
matrix is utilized to determine which new

453
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,019
observations is most likely to occur

454
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,021
given the current state and potential

455
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:49,022
transitions.

456
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,025
In the Cerulean framework, the

457
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:55,028
expectation gradient structure plays a

458
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,030
crucial role in defining the depth and

459
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,032
fulfillment of pretensions.

460
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:03,030
This structure represents the varying

461
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,032
degrees of certainty and confidence

462
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:07,034
agents have in their predictions about

463
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,035
future states.

464
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:13,040
The topology thus and the arrangements is

465
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,041
interrelation.

466
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,042
Sorry.

467
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,044
There is an interrelation between the

468
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,047
potentials or the arrangements of future

469
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,049
expectations which is proportional to the

470
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,050
expectation gradient.

471
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:25,052
The higher the gradient, the more

472
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,054
detailed and accurate the potentials are

473
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:28,055
likely to be.

474
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:32,059
The potential horizon represents thus the

475
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,061
static states of the expected futures of

476
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:36,063
the temporal object while the

477
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,066
continuation horizon is the amalgamated

478
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,067
trail of the temporal object.

479
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:44,071
Potential and continuation horizons are

480
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:47,074
carried in protensions while the imminent

481
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,076
horizon consists of the primal

482
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,077
impressions.

483
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,082
So agents can coordinate through

484
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:57,084
coconstruction where agents or

485
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:00,081
individuals interact and collaborate to

486
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,083
build this shared understanding and

487
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,085
shared goals.

488
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,088
This process is deeply interconnected

489
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,091
within a complex web where agents

490
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,094
typically coexist with other agents or

491
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:15,096
subjects forming a collective often

492
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:18,099
referred to as multiagent groups, swarm

493
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:20,101
ensembles or Samblage.

494
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:23,104
By aligning their beliefs to the signal

495
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,106
found within their niche they can better

496
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,108
adapt to the environment and develop a

497
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,109
shared understanding of their

498
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:29,110
surroundings.

499
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:33,114
Sharing information with other agents is

500
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,116
beneficial as it allows them to trust one

501
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,118
another and pool their resources.

502
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:40,121
This collaborative approach is preferable

503
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,123
to a conflict driven scenario in which

504
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,125
every other agent is perceived as a

505
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,127
potential source of risk and surprising.

506
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,129
By sharing information agents could

507
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,131
collectively construct a more accurate

508
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,133
representation of their environment

509
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,135
leading to more effective decision making

510
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,136
and action.

511
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,139
Through these interactions, shared

512
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,135
narratives and goals can emerge from a

513
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,137
coconstruction of the world and each

514
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,138
agent's generative model.

515
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,141
So these narratives and goals are the

516
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,143
result of dynamic process that in fact

517
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,145
can be mathematically modeled through the

518
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,147
equations that we introduce in the paper

519
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,149
that this presentation is based on but

520
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,152
that I will present a little bit later.

521
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,154
They capture the process of mutual

522
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,156
learning where agents adapt their

523
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,158
generative model based on the information

524
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,160
gathered from their interactions with

525
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,161
others.

526
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,164
Agents may start off with slightly or

527
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,166
greatly divergent generative model.

528
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,168
So in order to minimize surprise there

529
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,170
will be a natural alignment within a

530
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,172
group as agents adapt to the evolving

531
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,175
dynamics of their environment and social

532
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
contexts.

533
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,178
For example, again, consider this team

534
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,180
working on the project.

535
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,182
Even if you have your own understanding

536
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,184
of the model or of the project you'll

537
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,186
interact and share information and learn

538
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,188
from each other and then adapt the model.

539
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
.

540
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,190
Over time, you'll develop a shared

541
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,192
understanding of the project and a shared

542
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,194
goal for its completion.

543
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:02,191
This is an instance of coconstruction.

544
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:04,193
It's like building a house together where

545
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:06,195
everyone contributes to the final

546
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:06,195
structure.

547
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,199
The emergence of shared narratives and

548
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,201
the learning and recognition of them may

549
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,203
be made more efficient through certain

550
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:16,205
mechanisms such as language.

551
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,209
In an experiment illustrated in a paper

552
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:24,213
that Karl Rozan two agents share the same

553
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:27,216
sensorium ask each other's questions.

554
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,219
I think it's a paper on 20 questions and

555
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:32,221
Emma Holmes with a shared narrative

556
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:33,222
entailing a common language.

557
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,225
This illustrates the marked efficiency

558
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:37,226
and the minimization of free energy

559
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:39,228
simply by having a shared language, a

560
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:40,229
common ground.

561
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:44,233
So shared potentials are common future

562
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:47,235
anticipations or goals that emerge among

563
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,237
groups of individuals through

564
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:50,238
coconstruction.

565
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:52,241
It allows them to better anticipate each

566
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:54,243
other's actions and intentions and work

567
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,244
towards a common goal.

568
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:58,247
It's strongly tied to the conscious

569
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,244
efforts of individuals to work towards

570
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,246
that goal and to effectively create an

571
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:06,249
organizational structures where we're

572
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,251
engaged in a conversation in an exchange

573
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:11,254
assuming that this exchange is meant to

574
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,256
align our generative models.

575
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,259
So think of for instance, a football team.

576
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:16,259
.

577
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,261
Again, they have a shared potential to

578
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:19,262
win the match.

579
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,264
They anticipate each other's moves and

580
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:23,266
adapt their strategies based on the

581
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
ongoing game.

582
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:25,268
Everyone in the team has a shared vision

583
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,270
of victory and they're constantly

584
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,272
adjusting their actions to make it happen.

585
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:29,272
.

586
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,277
So individuals infer each other's mental

587
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,279
states by observing cues which they can

588
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,280
attribute to hidden causes.

589
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,283
They use their own model or models that

590
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,285
they have learned to recognize about

591
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,286
others.

592
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,288
This process is known as generalized

593
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:47,290
synchrony entailing mutual predictability,

594
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,292
, and can be interpreted as a collective

595
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,294
minimization of free energy.

596
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,298
In a group setting, individuals create

597
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,300
cues in the world that direct other

598
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,301
agents attentions towards the same

599
00:23:59,301 --> 00:23:59,302
signals.

600
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,298
Their models of the world align by

601
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,300
sharing similar goals and similar

602
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,302
environments and by reinforcing patterns

603
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:07,304
of sampling reality.

604
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:12,309
So we could try to represent this through

605
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,311
polynomials and morphisms.

606
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,313
Each agent's interaction with the

607
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:18,315
environment corresponds to a morphism,

608
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,317
and the collective interaction of all

609
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,319
agents can be represented as a polynomial.

610
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
.

611
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,324
So if a polynomial p is defined, morphism

612
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:30,327
between two polynomials, p and q,

613
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:33,330
consists of a pair of functions, f and g,

614
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,334
such that f maps p of one to q of one and

615
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:41,338
g maps P of I to q of the quantity one.

616
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,340
This morphism must satisfy the

617
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,343
commutative requirements, meaning that

618
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:49,346
the following diagram commutes p of I

619
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,349
maps to q of the quantity I and p of one

620
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:54,351
maps to q of one.

621
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,354
So we could see how we could create a

622
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,356
framework to further explore the

623
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,352
cooperative and competitive dynamics

624
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:02,353
among agents.

625
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:04,355
For multiple agents indexed by I with

626
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,357
boundaries p and share environment

627
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,359
boundary q, their interaction can be

628
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:11,362
represented by a morphism of polynomials,

629
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:13,364
which allows us to understand the shared

630
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,366
potential in multiagent systems and

631
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,368
provides a foundation for further

632
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,371
exploration of cooperative dynamics.

633
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,375
We allow each agent to predict not only

634
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,377
its own behavior, but also the behavior

635
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,379
of its companions and the environment's

636
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:30,381
response to their actions.

637
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:34,385
So the dynamics of shared predictions are

638
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:37,388
really useful here and can be properly

639
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:39,390
cashed out mathematically through

640
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,393
recursive cognition and prediction on the

641
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:45,395
shared environment of the agent's actions

642
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,398
and response to each other's actions.

643
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,401
We can use sheep's theoretic and topos

644
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:52,403
theoretical approaches to understand

645
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:54,404
multi agent systems.

646
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,406
A multi agent system is a system where

647
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:58,409
multiple individuals or entities interact.

648
00:25:58,409 --> 00:25:58,409
.

649
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:00,405
So for example, a traffic system can be

650
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,407
considered a multi agent system where

651
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,409
different vehicles interact.

652
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,411
A topos is a category that has both

653
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
spatial and logical structure, allowing

654
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,415
for the expression of logical

655
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,417
propositions and deductions within it.

656
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,419
So we can use these approaches to

657
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:16,421
construct a coherent understanding of the

658
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,423
world from the perspective of multiple

659
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
agents.

660
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,426
The internal universe of agents, which

661
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,428
can be seen as mathematical objects

662
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,430
containing beliefs, perceptions and

663
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,432
predictions of individual agents, are

664
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,434
represented using topoi.

665
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,437
These internal universes provide a

666
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,439
foundation for understanding and

667
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,441
representing the complex interactions and

668
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,443
shared understanding among multiple

669
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:41,445
agents in this dynamic environment.

670
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,449
We try to construct a consensus topos by

671
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,452
patching together the internal universes

672
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,454
or topoi of multiple agents.

673
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,456
And the idea is to use the sheep

674
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:53,458
theoretic and topos theoretic structures

675
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,459
to build a shared understanding.

676
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:00,459
So we can thus derive the synchronization

677
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,461
of goal oriented actions among agents

678
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,462
over time and leverage mathematical

679
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,464
insights for category theory and

680
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,466
generalized generative models.

681
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:10,469
This connection is the mechanism through

682
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,471
which the group synchronizes over time

683
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:15,474
and ultimately achieves their objective.

684
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,476
Agents within the system might possess

685
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:19,478
varying levels of certainty in achieving

686
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,479
the objective.

687
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,481
Some may choose to expend less energy,

688
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:24,483
temporarily decelerating their progress

689
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,485
towards the desired outcome.

690
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:28,487
This variation in certainty and approach

691
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,489
leads to the emergence of different roles

692
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,491
within a group, with some agents focusing

693
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,493
on computational tasks while other

694
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:36,495
monitor outcomes or engage in different

695
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:37,496
actions themselves.

696
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,498
The nested and distributed structure of

697
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,500
generative models in active inference

698
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,502
allows for the integration of both short

699
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:45,504
term and long term goals.

700
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:47,506
Agents with similar compatible

701
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:49,508
preferences can coordinate their actions

702
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:51,510
by aligning their policies and working

703
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,512
towards common narratives.

704
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,514
So this alignment reduces the overall

705
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,516
expected free energy of their joint

706
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:58,517
actions, increasing the likelihood of

707
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:00,513
achieving shared goals and facilitating

708
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
the sharing of goals and expectation

709
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,516
among group members.

710
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,521
They can learn, which allows them to

711
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,523
learn essential role in shaping agents

712
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,525
preferences and strategies.

713
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,527
Over time, agents can gather new

714
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,529
experiences and update their generative

715
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:16,529
model.

716
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,532
They refine their preferences and methods

717
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,533
for achieving goals.

718
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,535
They can influence the formation and

719
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,537
modification of shared narratives by

720
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,538
having different perspective over

721
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,540
different parts of a goal.

722
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,543
Here, the concept of generalized

723
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,545
synchrony is manifested when all agents

724
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,547
have learned compatible or harmonized

725
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,550
aspects of the overall generative model.

726
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,552
The synchronization is rooted in the

727
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,554
retentional and potential dynamics of

728
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,555
agents and can be more accurately

729
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,557
described using mathematical models.

730
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,563
So, in conclusion, we tried to shed light

731
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,566
on the concept of shared potential goals

732
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,568
and multiagent systems.

733
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,569
We've emphasized the importance of

734
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,571
understanding this concept as it plays a

735
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,567
crucial role in the coordination

736
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:01,568
synchronization of agents actions and

737
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,569
intentions.

738
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,572
We in the future continuously highlight

739
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,574
the role of cues in the environment and

740
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,577
how they can be simple like marks on the

741
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,579
road or more complex like symbols and

742
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:12,579
language.

743
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,581
The queues become carriers of passive

744
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:16,583
synthesis, far pretensions and far

745
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,585
retention, and become ways to minimize

746
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,587
free energy as they minimize the amount

747
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:22,589
of any individual has to compute.

748
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:25,592
It also allows us to delve into the

749
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:28,595
concept of other evidencing in which the

750
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:31,598
environment is in effect the self and

751
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:34,601
others must learn to navigate in terms of

752
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
others and self.

753
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:40,606
We've provided mathematical models to an

754
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:41,608
equations to analyze dynamics of shared

755
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:43,610
potentials more accurately.

756
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,612
In terms of category theory, we've

757
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:46,613
explored the dynamics of shared

758
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:49,615
retentions and potentials in hierarchical

759
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:50,617
generative models which reflect the

760
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,619
complex interplay of individual and

761
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:54,620
collective dynamics.

762
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,623
We've encapsulated the structure of time

763
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:59,626
consciousness and how this allows agents

764
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,622
to co compute shared potentials by

765
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,624
mapping each other's cognitive pathways.

766
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,628
So our approach basically begins an

767
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,631
examination of hospital temporal

768
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,633
phenomenology integrated with a

769
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,635
hierarchical active inference model,

770
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:17,638
polynomial morphisms and home polynomials.

771
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
.

772
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,640
This enables recursive cognition and

773
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,643
prediction of not only an agent's actions,

774
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,645
, but also the environment's response to

775
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:25,645
these actions.

776
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,649
So I think this comes to the end, Daniel.

777
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
.

778
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,651
I think I'm literally at 30 minutes.

779
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:34,655
Daniel: Thank you, impeccable.

780
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,657
Thank you, Mahault it.

781
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:40,661
Yeah, great presentation.

782
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,662
Awesome topic.

783
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:43,664
So thank you for joining and looking

784
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:45,666
forward to seeing how the work continues

785
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,667
to develop.
