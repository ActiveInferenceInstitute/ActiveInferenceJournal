1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,659
all right

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,380
see you

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,840
and it's a great

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,059
segue from

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,799
Collective behavior in Surprise

behavior in Surprise minimizing agents I

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,840
guess welcome Connor

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,939
hey so I just turned on my audio so I

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,580
just heard the last thing you said yeah

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,099
okay

12
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,660
yes thanks

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,439
um

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,820
we're looking forward to your

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,160
presentation multi-agents active

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,660
inference and multi-skill Alignment

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,480
current developments and challenges so

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,820
feel free to share your screen or

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,219
proceed however you prefer

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,379
great thanks and before I start can I

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,300
just um because I've had issues with my

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,760
my voice like saturating like my

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,440
microphone saturating how's my audio is

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,940
it clipping at all or does this sound

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,219
okay this this is good and I'm watching

26
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,120
it

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,739
okay perfect thank you

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,640
um I will share my screen

29
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,159
I'm going to share this one and then the

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,200
one thing I'll note oh yes okay it's

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,500
just JF symbolic implementation does not

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,439
use statistical distributions it uses

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,659
the

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,060
um symbolic and The Logical inference

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,460
and now we're going to move back into

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,100
the distributional space and it'll be

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,540
awesome to see similarities and

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,299
differences so thank you Connor to you

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,000
for the presentation

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
and thank you um Daniel for the

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
introduction and for inviting me as well

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,420
as big thank you to the other organizers

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,159
of the third applied active defense

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,840
Symposium

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,939
um yeah I'm really happy to be here to

46
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,280
pick presents so my name is Connor Hines

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,619
I'm a PhD student at the max Park

48
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,840
Institute of animal behavior and I'm

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,860
also a researcher at the versus AI

50
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,960
research lab rmd Lab

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,939
um so I'm gonna do something a little

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,280
bit I guess unconventional for

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,380
people in my position like I'm a junior

54
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,360
researcher coming to the end of my PhD

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,699
so usually when I give a talk I would

56
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,400
present on my own research

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,020
um like what I've been up to for the

58
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,720
last 10 years working on but instead of

59
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,080
that I'm actually gonna talk about

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,580
giving the motivation of the Symposium

61
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,780
I'm going to talk about something that's

62
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,720
more of an overview or perspective on

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,879
the current state of the field in

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,620
multi-scale active inference or

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,599
multi-agent active inference

66
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,780
and what in my opinion we need to do to

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,879
move forward as a field I think that's

68
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,760
very um resonant with the kind of

69
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,920
motivations and the title indeed of this

70
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,500
Symposium so I'm going to give a general

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,540
analysis of what multi-scale activations

72
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,840
is why it's important I'm going to

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,940
provide a brief analysis of its formal

74
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,280
basis as it currently stands and then

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
what we need to develop in this kind of

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,620
sub-discipline of active inference

77
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,120
multi-scale active inference to really

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,920
make it rigorous and really to actually

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,300
reap the benefits of what it promises

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
um so generally active inference has

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,300
been used a lot to design agents that

82
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,540
can solve problems plan and just

83
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,480
generally emulate behavior that we deem

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,340
intelligent which includes things like

85
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,700
Risk sensory decision making intrinsic

86
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,400
motivations to resolve uncertainty and

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,659
finally from a more scientific

88
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,360
standpoint the ability to furnace a

89
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,400
process theory about how biological

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
brains actually might work

91
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,440
um but in a lot of the theoretical work

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,720
on active inference from the last 10

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,620
years is or 10 plus years really there's

94
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,959
also alongside all the kind of practical

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,000
building adaptive agents there's a claim

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
that active inference is inherently or

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,099
intrinsically multi-scale from the very

98
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,319
get-go it is a multi-scale framework

99
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,299
it's not just about building single

100
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,680
agents

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,900
um so it's really whenever we write down

102
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,000
a single active inference agent what

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,680
we're implicitly implying is also a

104
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,540
nested hierarchy of active inference

105
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,019
agents both below and above so

106
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,640
colloquially you'll often see this in

107
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,379
papers as the idea that there's Markov

108
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,199
blankets all the way down markup blanket

109
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,238
is a statistical structure that's very

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,560
kind of

111
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,139
um intrinsic the definition of Agents as

112
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,000
they are defined in under active

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,139
inference so I'm not going to get into

114
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,780
defining that I'm kind of assuming that

115
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,280
there's a more disciplinary audience

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
there but I'm sure other touch feelings

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,479
Symposium can provide better Clarity so

118
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,759
yeah Markov blankets active in things

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,860
all the way down all the way up

120
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,160
and at any given scale crochet the free

121
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,380
energy minimizing Dynamics or the active

122
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,660
inference Dynamics are kind of claimed

123
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,540
to be aligned with or parallel to the

124
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,820
free energy minimizing gradients at the

125
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,699
level below and above so what what the

126
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,860
claim is that as agents are doing their

127
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,780
thing and doing active Infamous at one

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,900
level it both entails and is constrained

129
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,360
by active inference processes of the

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,460
macro agent that they're participating

131
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,300
in so I'm a cell that's part of a tissue

132
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,220
as well as the microagents that comprise

133
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,680
them I am a free energy minimizing

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
cellular agent comprised of organelles

135
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,600
that are also minimizing free energy

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,919
so this this kind of constrained neat um

137
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,259
nested gradient descent on free energy

138
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,360
is part of the story of multi-scale

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,460
active inference and it also crucially

140
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,500
assumes that these Dynamics are aligned

141
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,539
correlated Cooperative across these

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,759
different scales so I should mention

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,520
that there is a formal argument made

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,139
more recently I would say in the last

145
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,660
five years about how this is possible

146
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,120
and it relies on an apparatus from

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,620
statistical physics called the

148
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,900
renormalization group this basically

149
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,820
allows you to analytically identify

150
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,460
shared symmetries energy and

151
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,160
conservation laws at different scales in

152
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
a given system that's comprised of

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,560
subsystems and subsystems so on at

154
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,080
infernium so there's a formal argument

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
specific we made in the a free energy

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,180
principle for a particular physics

157
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,820
monograph from 2019 that applies the

158
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,060
renormalization group apparatus to

159
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,860
multivariates stochastic differential

160
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,419
equations that are kind of the

161
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,900
equivalent of a regions so you can apply

162
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,900
that that framework to certain sorts of

163
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,819
coupled stochastic differential

164
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,520
equations that exhibit Markov blanketed

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,560
Swatch coupling structure and you can

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
kind of prove analytically that there

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,819
are going to be domestic systems of

168
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,220
Markov blankets and that they're all in

169
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,199
some sense to minimizing three energies

170
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,120
at their Urban scales so I'll get more

171
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
into that argument later but I just want

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,440
to mention that as I Define multi-scale

173
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,300
active inference that

174
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,220
um that there is a formality that that's

175
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,199
related to it

176
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,840
so this slide I just put together to

177
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,699
demonstrate the idea of nested free

178
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,919
energy minimizing processes visually so

179
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,600
at a given scale we can think of an

180
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,880
agent as occupying some point in its

181
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,220
free energy landscape indicated by this

182
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,639
Red Orb which represents say its

183
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,440
configuration its beliefs and its

184
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,020
actions and it performs active inference

185
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,300
and in doing so minimizes its free

186
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,100
energy so it changes the position of

187
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,259
that ball on that landscape and that is

188
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,940
all we mean when we say active inference

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,660
that that corresponds to the agent doing

190
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,039
inferencing doing action and kind of

191
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,139
getting to the fixed point of its local

192
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,880
free energy landscape

193
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,280
the multi-agent case is simply when we

194
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,199
add more of these processes so there's

195
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,960
other agents usually assumed to be

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,300
similar agents and the word similarity

197
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,520
let's put the asterisks on that and

198
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,900
they're all sitting at different points

199
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,639
in their own free energy Landscapes

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,979
they're all the the position of their

201
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,840
local Red Ball is maybe in a different

202
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,060
place

203
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,220
so the claim of multi-scale active

204
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,500
influence is that as we link these

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,180
multiple active inference agents

206
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,220
together so they can actually exchange

207
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,960
information like observations and

208
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,060
actions with each other what we

209
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,520
automatically get is some kind of super

210
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,099
agent that is also minimizing variation

211
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,860
of free energy and is in some sense an

212
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,500
emergent or supervenient active

213
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,960
inference agent and I say the word we

214
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,360
automatically get a super Engine with an

215
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,759
asterisk because there may be some

216
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,919
conditions on that mapping from local to

217
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,800
Global that have to be elucidated

218
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,900
um so we'll come back to that in a bit

219
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,300
but in short I think the the definition

220
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,339
of multi-scale active entrance is very

221
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,099
eloquently put in this paper by

222
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,979
um Raphael uh Kaufman pranav Gupta and

223
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,799
Jacob Taylor I think Rafael Kaufman is

224
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,899
actually going to be on the panel later

225
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,779
um and this line from their paper is a

226
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,000
really nice uh I think just summary of

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,959
what it is

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
so I'll just redo that right the upshot

229
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
is that in theory any active inference

230
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,040
agent at one spatio temporal scale could

231
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,080
be simultaneously composed of nested

232
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
active infant agents at the scale below

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,820
and constituent of a larger active

234
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,220
infantation at the scale above it in

235
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,200
effect active inference allows you to

236
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
pick a composite system or agent a that

237
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,459
you want to understand and it will be

238
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,040
generally true that both that that agent

239
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,860
a is an approximate Global minimizer of

240
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,320
free energy at the scale at which that

241
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,980
agent reliably persists and that agent a

242
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,060
is composed of subsystems a sub I that

243
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,040
are approximate local minimizers with

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,320
free energy so that is the claim as I'm

245
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,260
going to like continue continue

246
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,240
evaluating it in this talk and I think

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,580
it's just a great reference point to

248
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,600
make

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
so okay that that that's what

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,279
multi-scale active inference is why is

251
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,959
it important why do we actually care

252
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,820
about that that sounds philosophically

253
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,100
nice and beautiful visually but why is

254
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,839
that important so there's a ton of

255
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,279
actually really important implications

256
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,380
of this both for the engineering and the

257
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,820
Natural Sciences

258
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,200
um first of all the namesake of the

259
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,660
Symposium I assume inspired by this

260
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,180
recent paper by Carl ferson at all about

261
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,000
enacting ecosystems of

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,860
you know parenthetically shared

263
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,779
intelligence so this is the third

264
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,940
applied active inference of opposium so

265
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,339
to to really make this resonate with the

266
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,200
applied aspect let's make this very

267
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,480
concrete if we can figure out this

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,700
multi-scale endeavor then we can

269
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,040
actually engineer distributed systems of

270
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,140
multi-aging intelligence where local

271
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,180
agents and doing their own little local

272
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,580
active inference processes are also

273
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,980
cooperatively instantiating a global

274
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,320
agent that's also performing active

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
interest this has huge computational

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,180
potential of course compared to kind of

277
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,240
the state of VR predominant methods for

278
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,700
artificial intelligence which are deep

279
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,320
learning which really is about

280
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,600
propagating Global Information through

281
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,180
an entire computation graph so although

282
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,920
you could argue back propagation is

283
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,959
local in some sense it's really not

284
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,820
local in the way that multi-scale active

285
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,220
influence promises to be local so if we

286
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,200
can figure out how to actually engineer

287
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,060
multi-scale academic difference it will

288
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,339
have really tremendous implications for

289
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,959
the study of artificial intelligence

290
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,760
just from that pure engineering

291
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,839
standpoint

292
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,360
it'll be cheaper in one where it'll be

293
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,160
computationally energetically Memory

294
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,000
wise cheaper a lot cheaper secondly

295
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,279
from a kind of more Natural Sciences

296
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,720
motivation which is kind of where I'm

297
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,240
coming from I get a p I'm doing a PhD in

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
biology so I'm interesting questions

299
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
about actual real systems in nature just

300
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,899
the idea of being able to get super

301
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,940
specific and rigorous about phrases like

302
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,339
emergence intelligence emerging

303
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,320
computation collective intelligence

304
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,600
super organism that's often thrown

305
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
around we're talking about social

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,320
insects right these are terms that you

307
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
hear thrown around in many different

308
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,579
scientific disciplines that deal with

309
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:49,860
multi-agent systems um Network systems

310
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,560
but none of these terms to my knowledge

311
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,300
have really rigorous or precise

312
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,579
conditions multi-scale active inference

313
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,040
is a kind of framework that's in the

314
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,660
position to provide those rigorous

315
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,820
definitions and conditions so from a

316
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,860
scientific standpoint it could really

317
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,880
lend a lot of potential and usefulness

318
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,220
for other scientific disciplines and

319
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,839
finally another pragmatic motivation

320
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,579
there's loads of fields that are

321
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,920
obsessed with designing and Engineering

322
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,180
Systems where local selfish individual

323
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,740
Behavior can lead

324
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,839
when networks appropriately to some

325
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,940
desired Collective outcome and these

326
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,079
disciplines you really want to figure

327
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,060
out how to engineer that properly so

328
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,440
this goes from the design of financial

329
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,720
markets and trading systems all the way

330
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,240
down to how do you design a multiplayer

331
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,279
video game

332
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,620
so that that's kind of just motivating

333
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,600
why is multi-scale active influencing

334
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,740
and interesting

335
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,660
so then the question of course becomes

336
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,940
is the multi-scale active infancy claim

337
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,060
actually true are all multi-agent active

338
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,100
inference systems comprised of and

339
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,500
themselves comprise nested hierarchy of

340
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,480
free energy minimizing agents

341
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,459
a glance at a smattering of other

342
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,380
scientific disciplines that specifically

343
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,720
deal with multiple agents multiple

344
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,240
interests Collective phenomena like

345
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,399
coordination group Behavior collective

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,480
intelligence

347
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,980
I'll go answer all those disciplines

348
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,660
would naively suggest that their answer

349
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,300
is no so there's things like frustration

350
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,899
in thermodynamic systems Game Theory the

351
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,880
very existence of zero-sum games and

352
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,579
Nash equilibria bandwagon effects when

353
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,260
we're talking about social networks and

354
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,139
and um opinion Dynamics

355
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,600
um sacrifices for the common good which

356
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,519
we see in different contexts in biology

357
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,680
like in the context of kin selection but

358
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,019
also in the context of arguably cell

359
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,420
cell death in a tissue

360
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,760
um these are all basically plenty of

361
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,500
systems where local constraints and

362
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,720
Global constraints or desires or free

363
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,220
energy gradients whatever you want to

364
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,560
call them coming to direct conflict so

365
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,019
the obvious example that I I listed at

366
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,000
the top of these on bullets is the idea

367
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,519
of geometrics frustration that we see in

368
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,320
ising systems with very low temperature

369
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
so these izing models basically describe

370
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,899
lattices of ferromagnets that are happy

371
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,519
when they're pointing in the same

372
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,079
direction as their neighboring Fair

373
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,940
amendments and they can be in an up or a

374
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,940
down state so basically the magnet can

375
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,680
be pointing up or pointing down and

376
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,480
these Global Systems are defined by a

377
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,279
global energy function and the whole

378
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,139
system is in some sense trying to

379
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,660
minimize that Global energy function but

380
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,459
sometimes you'll find cases in these

381
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,779
Collective systems where this little

382
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,060
spangle in the middle cannot be happy

383
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,560
because they're getting conflicting

384
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,660
information from two neighbors I want to

385
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,779
be pointing up in blue like the agent on

386
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,639
the left but I also want to be pointing

387
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,620
down like the Asia on the right so this

388
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,139
is a system that's collectively finding

389
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,820
some fixed point of its Global free

390
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,220
energy but it's actually leading to a

391
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,500
local conflict where this agent is not

392
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,720
at a point where it can do anything to

393
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,579
make itself happy or minimizes free

394
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,160
energy further so just from even the

395
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,320
basic glance at uh ferromagnetic

396
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,779
lattices we already see instances where

397
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,620
local and Global gradients or local and

398
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Global Optima are not aligned in the

399
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,820
right way

400
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,699
so given all this the burden of proof

401
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,620
for multi-scale active infants is still

402
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,420
on up so we need to show that Collective

403
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,779
active income systems generically do

404
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:18,480
align again across scales and maybe if

405
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,820
we can put an X across the word

406
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,800
generically and it's not some automatic

407
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,680
condition if they don't then at least we

408
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,540
have to establish exactly the conditions

409
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,899
in which they do

410
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,300
so anecdotally we do actually have some

411
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,620
conditions

412
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,019
there's some seem to be some kind of

413
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,940
basic ingredients to get Collective

414
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,459
Collective active inference to work so

415
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,740
one is that we basically need agents to

416
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,260
exchange actions and Sensations across

417
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,660
some kind of Markov blanket this is not

418
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,579
really a condition this is almost more

419
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,040
part of what it means to be an agent so

420
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,320
having more confidently gets separation

421
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,300
between agents is just another way of

422
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,220
saying we have multiple agents in our

423
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,560
system rather than a single agent if

424
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,060
you're violating a Markov blanket

425
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,399
property so internal states of One agent

426
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,800
are not allowed to see the internal

427
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,540
States or external states of another

428
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,339
agent then you're kind of cheating

429
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:12,420
because you're kind of saying it's

430
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,220
actually One agent and what you're doing

431
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,500
is information sharing within the brain

432
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,660
of a single region the second condition

433
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,800
which is something that's often

434
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,019
hallucinated more anecdotally and not

435
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,300
really formally is this idea that agents

436
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,860
need to have some kind of shared

437
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,079
narrative or shared hidden States or

438
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,000
censor space in their generative model

439
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,019
so I've worked a lot on Collective

440
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,300
active inference systems just simulating

441
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,860
agents and trying to get them to do

442
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,660
interesting things together and my

443
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,820
intuitions and experience do agree with

444
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,160
this basic fact if the agents don't have

445
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,720
any similarity in what they're

446
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,060
representing or trying to achieve then

447
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,680
it's kind of like trying to fit a square

448
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,079
peg into a circular hole so this is

449
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,959
really nicely elucidated in the one of

450
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,820
the earliest cases in this paper a duet

451
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,759
for one by first in the first in 2015

452
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,220
where they show that for two agents to

453
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,899
really align they kind of have to have a

454
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,819
shared generative model and then you can

455
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,439
get kind of this nice synchronized

456
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,400
Behavior

457
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
again though these things like what does

458
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,419
similarity mean what does a shared

459
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,919
narrative actually made formally

460
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,780
mathematically those things have not

461
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,059
been initiated yet so right now a lot of

462
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,040
the building of these Collective systems

463
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,140
is based on our intuitions and kind of

464
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,480
engineering things in using some vague

465
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,919
guidelines like oh they should have a

466
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,260
shared sensor space but there's no

467
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,360
mathematical conditions or guarantees

468
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,340
about what degree of similarity is

469
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,679
needed between two agents models to get

470
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,660
the intended Dynamics

471
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,580
and finally we have to have at least

472
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,220
some agreement between the generative

473
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,799
model of each agent and the generative

474
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,500
process which is really the behavior of

475
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,299
the other agents generating their data

476
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,220
so this is kind of related to the the

477
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,900
previous point about average share

478
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,360
generative models but just to be very

479
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,380
specific

480
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,440
the physics of the space that transfers

481
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,600
your actions to my observations that

482
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,760
physics can't be dramatically crazily

483
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,160
different than how our generative models

484
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,799
represent those physics so if we took

485
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,080
two fish with the same generative model

486
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,539
of each other and they normally would

487
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,340
school together in a fish tank but we

488
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,740
throw them in a volcano or shoot them

489
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,020
out into outer space they won't school

490
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,460
together because then the generative

491
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,559
process is so dramatically deviating

492
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,600
from the way they're representing that

493
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,700
physics the way they're generating model

494
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,980
is constructed so these are again just

495
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,600
ingredients kind of guidelines or

496
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
anecdotes but there's nothing really

497
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
rigorous Behind These conditions they're

498
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,840
more like a list of best practices

499
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,940
so now let's get on to actual rigorous

500
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,220
stuff so the first real rigorous attempt

501
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,660
to show that multi-scale active

502
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,179
inference generally works is in one

503
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,860
section of this free energy principle

504
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,539
for a particular physics monograph from

505
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,299
2019 so it leverages this apparatus I

506
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,100
mentioned earlier the renormalization

507
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,440
group operator to basically show how one

508
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,000
can successively course screen

509
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,919
multi-variate stochastic differential

510
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,380
equations that admit sparse coupling

511
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,960
between their state variables so the

512
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,760
main result in my mind that connects

513
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
these remobilization group results to

514
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,620
multi-scale acts of inference is the

515
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,539
fact that the lagrangian of the system

516
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,720
at one scale can be expressed as a

517
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,340
function of the lagrangian at other

518
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,140
scales and that applies in a scale

519
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,080
invariant fashion that is the main like

520
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,260
uh kind of output or the main benefit of

521
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,840
using a renormalization group apparatus

522
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,820
so you can kind of think of LaGrange

523
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,160
like the generative model it's a it's a

524
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,900
physics Trend but it's related to the

525
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,640
generative model of the agents that

526
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,740
comprise the system and therefore also

527
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,260
their free energy so in terms of active

528
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,880
inference it means that this reasoning

529
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,799
of the renormalization group can be used

530
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,900
to smoothly move between the models of

531
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,120
individual agents at one scale and the

532
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,460
model of a collective or larger agent at

533
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,260
a different scale or a smaller scale for

534
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,179
that matter and the nice thing about it

535
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,640
is general for all kinds of Dynamics and

536
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,340
thus generic models it doesn't depend

537
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,500
heavily on the form of the stochastic

538
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,179
differential equations that form your

539
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,419
system

540
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,140
um the issues with it is that there's

541
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,380
not a Global Link to basic mechanics and

542
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,179
active inference it's still all done in

543
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,460
the traditional physics formalism so we

544
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,919
don't actually have an explicit link to

545
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,840
local inference and Global inference

546
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,919
although if you know the connection

547
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,600
between the lagrangian and the

548
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,160
generative model and the free energy

549
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,320
then you can make that connection but

550
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,600
it's not actually made explicitly for us

551
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,700
in this part of the monograph it also

552
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,840
requires the assumption that the

553
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,280
generative model and the generative

554
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,380
process are identical at the local level

555
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,360
that's where we need to have lagrangian

556
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
is defined that's also a restrictive

557
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,840
assumption that's probably not realistic

558
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,179
in my opinion and then finally there's

559
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,400
something about uh kind of spatio

560
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,039
temporal segregation of scales so we

561
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,900
need to make assumptions about how fast

562
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,000
random fluctuations are at one scale

563
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,039
relative to another scale in order to

564
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,900
justify kind of core screening or

565
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,419
forgetting about certain States As you

566
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,220
move between scales and that's also

567
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,320
something that you could argue current

568
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,600
Research into Collective Dynamics

569
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,419
challenges that that assumption about

570
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,700
how how fast noise is that one scale go

571
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,860
up to the to the next

572
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,600
so now I'm going to discuss quickly

573
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,340
another small contingent of active

574
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,380
inference research that is attempted to

575
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,299
address this mapping between local and

576
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,940
Global Insurance processes so what I

577
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,380
want to kind of just generally say with

578
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,880
this presentation and to our community

579
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,440
is that the kind of approach taken in

580
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,419
these two papers first of all active

581
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,440
entrance model of collective

582
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,659
intelligence and speaker glass systems

583
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,340
there's Collective active influence this

584
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,980
is one of the types of research I think

585
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,960
we really need to move active inference

586
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
multi-scale active inference forward so

587
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,620
I'm not trying to be too biased because

588
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,299
I am the first author on the second of

589
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,860
those papers but I'll also be the first

590
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,900
one to point out the limitation but

591
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,520
benefits wise I think these approaches

592
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,780
are really important because they

593
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,240
formally relate a local generative model

594
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,059
at one scale to a global generative

595
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,340
model at a different scale so really Tai

596
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,840
how do the parameters in one model

597
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,419
relate to a course grade model and these

598
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,120
are really good um steps in the

599
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,799
direction of a formal theory of

600
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,539
collective intelligence that goes from

601
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,520
local intelligences to Global

602
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,080
intelligence

603
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
however there's still issues with these

604
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,280
one of them is that they only deal with

605
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,500
the issue with infants at the global

606
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,260
level not active inference so these both

607
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,240
these papers concerned with a bunch of

608
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,620
local active inference agents that

609
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,659
cooperate to form a global inference

610
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,299
agent like a passive-basing agent rather

611
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,700
than an active inflation and it's also

612
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,559
unclear whether the system studying

613
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,620
these papers are actually very generic

614
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,600
like the results are generic to studying

615
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,580
collective intelligence in general or

616
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,740
their nice formal arguments but they're

617
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,600
only applicable to these specific

618
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
systems so we still don't have something

619
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,980
that's even more kind of zoomed out and

620
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,440
Abstract than these which tend to be a

621
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,440
little bit case specific and finally the

622
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,280
actual

623
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,320
um scale Transcendence that we're doing

624
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,179
in these papers is still relegated to

625
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,960
really one step we're not doing the full

626
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,700
multi-scale infinite scale regression

627
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,860
that's something like renewalization

628
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,720
group promises

629
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,340
so that's kind of the current overview

630
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,080
of what I think are the most promising

631
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,880
directions when multi-scale active

632
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
infants and I'm aware on time sorry five

633
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,679
minutes so I'm going to quickly try to

634
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,320
go through what I think are really

635
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,559
promising directions to push in terms of

636
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,600
multi-scale active infants and kind of

637
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,980
intuition products that I think will

638
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,179
help us

639
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,760
study these systems in a way that's

640
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,559
different and also actually better

641
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,960
informed by other research disciplines

642
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,480
so the the general idea that I'd like to

643
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
put forward is that misaligned gradients

644
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,039
can actually be a good thing so it's

645
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,260
actually sometimes good when local free

646
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,840
energy gradients are misaligned with

647
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,780
global grains so sometimes the global

648
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,000
system will actually do better if the

649
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,520
local systems are performing worse so

650
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,539
this is something you could call

651
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,880
multi-scale conflict with a free energy

652
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,980
minimizing process at one scale are

653
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,320
actually doing bad quote unquote but

654
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,120
it's because they're being driven by

655
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,860
some higher scale process that is doing

656
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,200
well so rather than trying to always

657
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
avoid constructing processes like this I

658
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,240
think this kind of frustration to use

659
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,460
the analogy from statistical physics can

660
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,159
actually be an inspiration for what we

661
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,720
should investigate further because it

662
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,280
actually might be key to facilitating

663
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,960
optimality at different scales

664
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,100
um the reason I put this forward is

665
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,100
because there's loads of research just

666
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
Recent research in the last several

667
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,340
years that are suggesting that actually

668
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,679
making local agents more frustrated or

669
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,500
more unhappy might coincidentally or not

670
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,840
coincidentally lead to better Collective

671
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,179
or Global outcomes so this is expressing

672
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,460
various forms in various bodies of work

673
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,960
but one of the biggest patterns I've

674
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,580
noticed is the study of collective

675
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,679
Behavioral Systems over the last several

676
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,900
decades is the idea that local noise and

677
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,720
local dysregulation can often facilitate

678
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,700
Global coherence or the global

679
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,100
coordination and where multi-scale

680
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,659
active inference has something to say in

681
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,720
my opinion is in framing this benefit of

682
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
local frustration in terms of a

683
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,280
misalignment of free energy gradients so

684
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,659
maybe that actually temporary

685
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,760
misaligning local free energy energy

686
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,919
gradients from Global ones may

687
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,020
facilitate the dissent to fixed points

688
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,240
in the global free energy landscape that

689
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
satisfy everyone at all scales so I'm

690
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,740
basically expressing an idea that's been

691
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,240
known in various communities like

692
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,220
stochastic optimization and stochastic

693
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,799
resonance theory for decades but I think

694
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,779
we as active influence practitioners

695
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,340
have a newer and potentially useful

696
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,679
perspective to shed on that using the

697
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,240
language of that given for inside free

698
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,679
energy and minimization and Bayesian

699
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,720
inference in general so instead of

700
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,580
thinking of accelerating optimization by

701
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,620
just adding noise to the system we can

702
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,480
think of exactly how to design local

703
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,880
generative models such that there's an

704
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,640
optimal misalignment of local and Global

705
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
gradients or locally Global generative

706
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,539
models in a way that facilitates

707
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,220
everyone in the long run actually

708
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,260
facilitating or minimizing your free

709
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,500
energy

710
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,400
um so yeah that's just kind of like a

711
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,659
something I'm putting out there I'm

712
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,400
investigating it now in my own work but

713
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,960
I have no real results on that but I

714
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
just want to put that out there in this

715
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,559
venue because I think it maybe will

716
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,659
inspire other people to think in a

717
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,159
similar way

718
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,279
so just to conclude now multi-scale

719
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,080
active inference I would say is still

720
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,700
largely based in theoretical or

721
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,900
philosophical descriptions and

722
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,940
illustrative simulations but we're still

723
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,919
lacking a formal Theory

724
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,840
um there's some theory in terms of the

725
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,640
renormalization group arguments of the

726
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,440
monograph but they're still in my

727
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,179
opinion a bit underdeveloped a little

728
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,460
under demonstrated and rely on some

729
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,860
restrictive restrictive assumptions like

730
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,380
the fast and slow fluctuations the

731
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,760
identity between generative model

732
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,380
generic process

733
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,659
there's a few more recent papers those

734
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,600
two by um Kaufman at all and then by

735
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,480
myself on spin glass systems that have

736
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,980
attempted particular proofs of

737
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,020
multi-scale Bayesian infant systems in

738
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,880
particular situations but their

739
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,559
generality is still not known and not

740
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,140
proven so we why I'm kind of trying to

741
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,760
conclude with is by saying we need to

742
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,020
incorporate findings from other

743
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,179
disciplines related to the role of noise

744
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,179
conflict and frustration in facilitating

745
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,179
not subverting collective intelligence

746
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,940
or Collective coordination and I think

747
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,440
we can really benefit by looking at

748
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,679
these other disciplines to help us build

749
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,539
a really powerful formal theater

750
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,880
multi-scale active inference and finally

751
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,980
I think we need to set the goal post for

752
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,720
what counts as a formal proof of

753
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,940
multi-scale active inference and once we

754
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,039
get there the ones we say okay this

755
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,779
causes proof this is satisfying how

756
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,000
could we use that to actually

757
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,679
um do the the hardest part in my opinion

758
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,140
which is engineering actual multi-scale

759
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,940
active inference systems that are

760
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,380
intelligent and minimizing free energy

761
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,960
have multiple skills

762
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,820
um yeah so with that I'm going to

763
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,039
conclude it looks like I'm just on time

764
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,779
so yeah thank you again for the

765
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,400
invitation to present and I'd like to

766
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,679
thank a bunch of people who are listed

767
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,140
here and Beyond who have influenced my

768
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,600
thinking in kind of my opinions

769
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,340
um yeah if there's time and happens I

770
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,418
take any questions of course

771
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,539
awesome great

772
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,880
talk I'll just give a few seconds if

773
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,480
anybody wants to type in a question also

774
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,299
it's really cool like aswin in the

775
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,840
previous session was highlighting pi mdp

776
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,260
and just the way in which

777
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,179
we enact the collective intelligence

778
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,940
different people seeing a paper where an

779
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,159
analytical formalization is introduced

780
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,900
and then there's still so much work to

781
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,179
get it to the package and then so much

782
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,159
more work to take it to the Last Mile

783
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,260
and I think your presentation really

784
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,900
checked a lot of those boxes

785
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,380
um I'll just read a question and then um

786
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,440
that will just be an appetizer for our

787
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,700
continued discussion so Marco Lynn asked

788
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,559
do you expect the inferentially

789
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,440
connected Dynamics to exhibit Behavior

790
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,860
akin to theories of multi-body systems

791
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,539
and to what extent can we transfer

792
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,500
insights from that multi-body of work

793
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,840
and then second question just

794
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,200
for our thinking and learning from Marco

795
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,480
have you explored integrating work with

796
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,059
uh integrating work on self-organized

797
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,799
criticality with multi-scale active

798
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,080
inference or other Frameworks who can

799
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,700
provide more flexible Frameworks or

800
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,740
assumptions for a generic notion of

801
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,980
multi-scale Dynamics great questions

802
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,960
I hope that we can continue

803
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
um have you back anytime or just

804
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,860
continue to collaborate in the ecosystem

805
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,840
so thank you for the Epic talk Connor

806
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,179
and good luck finishing your PhD

807
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,340
thanks a lot Daniel yeah I'll talk to

808
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,059
you soon

809
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,779
talk to you soon
