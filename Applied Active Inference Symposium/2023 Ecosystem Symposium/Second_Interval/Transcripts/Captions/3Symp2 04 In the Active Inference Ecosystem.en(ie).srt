1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,660
all right

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
for the next interval

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
we are in the section hosted by the

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,599
active inference Institute on our recent

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,579
paper active inference Institute and the

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,899
active inference ecosystem so two short

8
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,960
messages first if you're in the live

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,500
chat I'll post the link right now to the

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
paper and this can be more of like a

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,079
conversational interval

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,980
so if you have any questions about the

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,760
um the ecosystem or The Institute or

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,280
um any of the stuff that we're talking

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
about let's make it a conversation uh

16
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,960
and then second message if there are any

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,659
co-authors on this paper who are

18
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,260
listening to this stream then

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,260
message me on Discord or post in the

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,000
YouTube live chat or just check your

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,500
calendar and I expect some others to

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,759
join in

23
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,280
as we go

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,240
um

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,860
welcome Pablo

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,820
we'll be hearing in a little bit from

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
you as a presenter is there anything

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,979
that you want to just bring up or

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,619
reflect on before I share the screen

30
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,079
with the paper let me just walk through

31
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,820
it explore it and hear questions

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,240
okay

33
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,780
I'll bring in the paper and again anyone

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,480
watching live please just feel free to

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,020
write any questions and uh

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm just going to bring it so that Pablo

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,000
you're not going to see the paper

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,280
uh but it's it's on the live stream

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,420
all right

40
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,839
cool

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,160
well here we go

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,099
this is a paper

43
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,000
that had an awesome

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,379
co-authorship and even broader circles

45
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,379
beyond the listed co-authors of

46
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,360
collaboration and contributions so just

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
like everything that has happened and

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
will happen

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
in our work

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,160
it was massively participatory and a

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,459
real learning by doing and a real

52
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,760
enactment moment

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,459
the first version was released three

54
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,060
days ago on Saturday August 19th and

55
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll briefly just list all the authors

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,640
first we had the Institute as the

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,360
first author so that the citation can

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,659
always remain like Institute at all

59
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,319
Institute comma div inference Institute

60
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,000
and we also had Andrew guiller John

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,519
boyick Libra Burien Matthew Brown RJ

62
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,700

tamari Dean tickles and Alex vyatkin so

68
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,700
this includes

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,640
everyone from Founders and officers and

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,379
board of directors and formal

71
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,360
participants on different projects and

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,040
different roles as volunteers or

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,980
facilitators or interns and also people

74
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,739
who are continuing to join the fun and

75
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,560
show up and makes

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,019
The Institute in our field what it is

77
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
and what it can be what what we want it

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,000
to be

79
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,400
there's a table of contents for those

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
who like to click through and just

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
broadly there's going to be a preamble

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
on octave inference but outside of the

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Preamble this paper is not conceptual it

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,360
is not technical it is not philosophical

85
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,560
although perhaps it can be read in all

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,180
of those ways but it's quite a

87
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,940
logistical

88
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,860
historical

89
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,780
and vision oriented position documents

90
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,340
after getting some of the active

91
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,320
inferences out of the way in the

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,360
Preamble we're going to turn to The

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,340
Institute itself in terms of our Vision

94
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Values principles and how we see moving

95
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,919
through the challenges that we're facing

96
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,060
right now

97
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,620
onto the specific history of the

98
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,400
Institute our current organization model

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,139
in terms of our governance and

100
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,080
Leadership structure as well as the

101
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
Institute units the organizational units

102
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,600
that support all the work we do

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
we then turn out to the community and

104
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,060
ecosystem growth and development

105
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,900
and go through some details of

106
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,699
different roles

107
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,100
that are stakeholders and participants

108
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,259
in our space and some of the tools that

109
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,120
we use today for managing information

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,699
and message passing

111
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,440
we talk a little bit about our

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,060
Communications plan internal and

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,400
external both sides of the blanket

114
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,160
and point towards some of the types of

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
support infrastructure and

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,220
administration that we do and that we

117
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,080
will offer for the active inference

118
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,280
ecosystem

119
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,320
we frame that in terms of continual

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,539
deployment continual development and

121
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,979
quality performance and growth

122
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,800
evaluations across multiple scales close

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
with some discussion and then provide an

124
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,500
appendix that overviews

125
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,300
a variety of the open source services

126
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,759
that the Institute has provided over the

127
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,500
past so

128
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,840
let's just jump in I'm actually going to

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,180
jump into the open source Services first

130
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,100
and overview them before we jump back up

131
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,979
to the top and look at the big picture

132
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,740
because this is really to appreciate the

133
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,800
work of so many contributors who stepped

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,319
up in The Uncanny Valley in the gray

135
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,560
Zone in the ecosystem as it's forming as

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,840
it's always forming and really made it

137
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,880
happen and so many people we know are

138
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,419
out there scribbling or taking notes or

139
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,180
printing out papers by friston at all or

140
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,039
struggling and asking questions are

141
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,479
there applications of this how would

142
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,460
this matter why would this matter is

143
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,020
there a code version of this how do you

144
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,160
connect the dots between these equations

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,259
like those are what we ask every day and

146
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,380
so when people can combine their regimes

147
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,600
of attention into a synthetic

148
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,020
intelligence outcome then we go so far

149
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,520
so

150
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,979
the first category of works that the

151
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,199
Institute has developed are educational

152
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,479
we've done video live streams since the

153
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,660
end of 2020 till now more than 370 live

154
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,740
streams

155
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,860
all live streams are

156
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,580
curated in terms of their transcript and

157
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,740
we increasingly are developing automated

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,020
and semi-automated methods for

159
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,780
transcription translation sub captioning

160
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,840
language modeling and so on

161
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
we've had textbook groups actually now

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
as of now we have three completed

163
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,199
cohorts of the active inference textbook

164
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,139
group The 2022 textbook

165
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,539
we have two courses that are being

166
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,819
offered that are produced by external

167
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,800
content developers and both of these

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
have only started in the last three four

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,419
months first is Chris fields's physics

170
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,759
is information processing and second is

171
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,520
the works spearheaded by avell and

172
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,160
co-organized with Kairos research active

173
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,780
inference in the social sciences both of

174
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,039
these are like awesome and great

175
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,599
learning experiences

176
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,120
as we heard from earlier in the

177
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,860
Symposium we're working with Sanjeev

178
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,500
namjoshi on his incredible textbook

179
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
although almost to call it a textbook is

180
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
to either think more broadly about

181
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,199
textbooks than one has or constrain what

182
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,580
it really is that he's doing because

183
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,440
it's such a unique

184
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,680
real research development full spectrum

185
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,958
efforts so I'm really looking forward to

186
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,740
seeing how this plays out in 2024.

187
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,360
until then for those who want to get

188
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
involved with the testing that we do

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
and we've developed the active inference

190
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
ontology which is a critical resource

191
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,860
for the ecosystem it enables us to

192
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,779
Center accessibility rigor and

193
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,820
applicability across languages and

194
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,459
settings by knowing what it is that

195
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,899
we're talking about when we talk about

196
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,700
active inference

197
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,560
on the research side we've also

198
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,420
developed the ontology in a research

199
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,240
Direction in terms of research on and

200
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,720
about and with active inference itself

201
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,760
as far as software goes our primary

202
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
development first off has been the

203
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,720
documentation and connecting the dots

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,220
around some of these other incredible

205
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,860
packages that others are developing for

206
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,200
example just in this Symposium we've

207
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,360
heard from some of the core developers

208
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,980
and

209
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,740
open source contributors to Pi mdp the

210
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,420
python package for generative modeling

211
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,580
as well as just a couple of minutes ago

212
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,760
from bertofries and Dimitri bagayev

213
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,779
coming from the Julia language RX and

214
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,640
fur side and both of those are some of

215
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,380
the leading packages for applying active

216
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,060
inference so we do a lot of work to

217
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,380
connect those dots and make it more

218
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,600
accessible not everybody is going to

219
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,459
jump in with all six feet to a

220
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,720
programming language

221
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,160
and what we've done with active block

222
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,440
prints with the work of Jakob smackle

223
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,920
and others is to wrap generative models

224
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,779
from active inference inside of the

225
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,700
complex systems modeling framework

226
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,839
CatCat

227
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,040
we've developed notation

228
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,839
interoperability systems that actually

229
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,720
let us pull back one layer from the

230
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,000
implementational details themself for

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,420
example of RX infer or of Pi mdp so that

232
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,660
we can bring it halfway to where the

233
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,820
ontology and the visualization and the

234
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,500
natural language exists and then use

235
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,240
language models and other techniques to

236
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,180
deploy it in an implementation fashion

237
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,040
we've developed a host of research

238
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,779
Publications

239
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,180
we support people in all of their

240
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,060
different stages of their career

241
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,640
different seasons of life and some

242
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,240
really creative work has been directly

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,720
produced through an Institute project or

244
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
somebody who knows may have gotten good

245
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,980
ideas or good feedback just by hanging

246
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,839
out being in the game and we've

247
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,480
performed literature meta-analyzes to

248
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
help grapple with the scope and the

249
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
quantity and the quality of what is

250
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,740
unfolding before our eyes or before our

251
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,140
antenna again even as we only so

252
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,480
partially sample this ocean of

253
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,519
information

254
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,220
we're active in standard setting and

255
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,800
continue to develop our qualification

256
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
standards for active inference that

257
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,279
could be the basis of Education research

258
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,800
and professional development

259
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,019
we provide a variety of mentorship and

260
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,320
facilitation service type activities

261
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,180
including volunteer program internship

262
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,380
program

263
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,899
distributed facilitation and applied

264
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,700
active inference symposia

265
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,040
these activities just as all others that

266
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
we're describing above are open source

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,339
and they're also open to your

268
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,860
participation so if you

269
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,620
can follow some of those Suggestions by

270
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,680
JF time boxing and prioritize and pay

271
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,660
attention and be active all those fun

272
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,399
things that he said and you're looking

273
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,339
to do it in a semi-structured way with a

274
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,779
volunteer program

275
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,940
or in a more structured way with the

276
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,640
internship then I heartily encourage

277
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,180
people to get involved act now

278
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,300
and in terms of governance activity

279
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,180
we have a scientific Advisory Board as

280
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,880
well as a board of directors and

281
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,459
together with the officers those groups

282
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,260
constitute the formal governance

283
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,519
structure of the Institute but there's

284
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,399
also so much more to it and we look

285
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
forward to understanding what ecosystem

286
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,000
governance can look like in the coming

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,959
years

288
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
so welcome Dean I just summarized the

289
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,800
the work itself that was the pre pre

290
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,100
Preamble and now if you'd like to say hi

291
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,500
you or Pablo before we jump into more

292
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,120
sections of the paper or look at more

293
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,160
questions that people have asked how

294
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,139
goes it or what was your experience of

295
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,779
working with the paper or what brings

296
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,260
you on to this strange stream at this

297
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,220
opportune time

298
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,519
uh basically why I'm here is because I

299
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,240
for the first time even as as a acting

300
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
board member with

301
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,040
with the Institute I was able to get a

302
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,660
better sense of the kind of depth that

303
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,399
we aspire to

304
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,320
and I'm not sure whether or not we

305
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,920
are going to be I I really don't know

306
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
what directions we're going to be going

307
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,680
in the next

308
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,700
coming months weeks years Etc but I have

309
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,800
a better sense now as a result of

310
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,899
participating in this development

311
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,120
exercise

312
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,100
of what the potential is that I probably

313
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,720
had at any time and I've been with the

314
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,279
active infant Institute for a couple of

315
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,380
years so that's

316
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,240
saying something I think we had to get

317
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,820
to this point to be able to write this

318
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,959
document and now it's it's acting as a

319
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,660
bit of a springboard now which way we go

320
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,180
and how we land I'm not still certain

321
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,560
about what that looks like but I think

322
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,320
that's part of what the really

323
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,120
interesting thing is

324
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,820
um we seem to have moved away from the

325
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,839
dock and now the real Journey Begins so

326
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,200
that's my take on it so far

327
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,380
moving away from the dark

328
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,480
d-o-c-k pushing off

329
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,180
using it as a springboard continuing the

330
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,000
adventure leaving the preprint behind

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,920
continuing to version it as a living

332
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,579
document and also way finding outside of

333
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,959
the dock Pablo

334
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,060
oh wait I don't hear you yet Pablo

335
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,079
sorry oh I was mute hello

336
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,300
um it was a great experience to go

337
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
through the document and review it and

338
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,480
reread it and thinking about it actually

339
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,940
it's a living document which is super

340
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,899
exciting and I keep taking notes and and

341
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,940
hopefully uh

342
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,639
act on it on the future

343
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,079
and and it's been a super uh experience

344
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,240
to

345
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,579
to find

346
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,779
so many people with the same

347
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,160
um

348
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,360
some interest same interest

349
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,320
um some values that I really think

350
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,740
are going to be the basis of

351
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,019
organizations on the future so I think

352
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,380
we are doing something very cool here

353
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,199
cool all right well let's just walk

354
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
through some of the

355
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,459
sections in the 25 minutes that we have

356
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,620
um again the paper is being shown on the

357
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,600
stream but but Dean and probably don't

358
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,699
see it so

359
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,980
we

360
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,500
kicked off with a preamble

361
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,440
we wanted to introduce active inferences

362
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
briefly as we could

363
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,019
and point towards the fundamental first

364
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,420
principles and physics-based nature of

365
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,760
active inference

366
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,560
and initially Point towards its

367
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,019
integrative capacity in principle and

368
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,000
then in the second paragraph there's

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,220
about 104 citations in this paragraph

370
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,800
and that's where it's really only a

371
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,300
sampling

372
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,639
the domains 21 domains here so it's a

373
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,579
place where we can point to where is

374
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,260
active inference being applied or How is

375
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,240
active inference being applied or how is

376
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,100
it different or better than another

377
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,380
approach in a given setting which isn't

378
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,759
to say that it does everything in all

379
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,740
settings for all people at all times and

380
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,560
all of that but this is to say that

381
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
here's where one can look to find out

382
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,680
more and even just building this and

383
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,259
bring it all together we we see so many

384
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,040
opportunities for epistemic resources in

385
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,899
the ecosystem and having real-time

386
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,360
literature analyzes and all these kinds

387
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,799
of services that we want to provide

388
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,339
starting on page five we turn to The

389
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,599
Institute

390
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,980
itself

391
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,400
and we write as of August 2023 the

392
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,839
active inference Institute is a

393
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,520
registered non-profit organization

394
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,980
tasked with identifying establishing and

395
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,660
managing the sustainable implementation

396
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,919
of

397
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,959
administrative and governance functions

398
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,580
to give components of the octave

399
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,679
inference ecosystem coherent forms and

400
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,080
reliable channels of communication two

401
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,360
publishing and Licensing protocols that

402
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,039
establish open and fair use and

403
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,780
effective dissemination of community

404
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,299
products within and Beyond the ecosystem

405
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,000
three services at the scale of

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,799
individual humans and the community at

407
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,900
large so that stability is protected

408
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,240
while risk and uncertainty are minimized

409
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,840
within the ecosystem and four

410
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,880
organization and operation of cyber and

411
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,919
cognitive security systems that ensure

412
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,440
productivity inclusivity accessibility

413
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,980
and safety in discourse in collaboration

414
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,200
figure one gives a graphical

415
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,559
representation just one

416
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,020
of how we are now and for those who want

417
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,020
to dig more check out the 2022 active

418
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,299
inference textbook where you'll also

419
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,360
find a golden ring and we kind of took

420
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,780
that graphical Motif and ran with it had

421
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,400
a lot of fun and a lot of

422
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,260
interpretations there

423
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,679
so just here looking at figure one

424
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,080
Dean or Publishers want to add anything

425
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,120
yeah Dean

426
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,840
so one thing about the building of this

427
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,400
document

428
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,100
um with a whole bunch of authors

429
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,760
uh

430
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,740
it's often not made explicit but there

431
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,780
are two aspects to learning about

432
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,660
yourself one is to actually throw some

433
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,760
stuff down on paper

434
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,760
because you believe certain things need

435
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,820
to be included and and the second part

436
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,940
is the consolidation process and I think

437
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,840
one of the most interesting

438
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,320
consolidation processes was this graphic

439
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,260
because I think what what it does is it

440
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,039
tries to condense as as much as possible

441
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,840
and yet still remain coherent around

442
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
what the relational aspects that we are

443
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,280
trying to make available are as opposed

444
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,940
to this is what we've captured now look

445
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,100
look what our graphic designer came up

446
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,360
with

447
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
so if you've had a chance to kind of

448
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,299
look at this and really analyze it and

449
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,880
think about the layers and think about

450
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,340
okay so what's the background here

451
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,160
what's the foreground does this

452
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,400
representation allow for a swapping

453
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
can we have things that appear to be

454
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,039
background or you know fundamental basis

455
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,620
stuff that could actually be things that

456
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,960
we are addressing in the moment versus

457
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
those things which we look at as

458
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,220
particulars that in fact are

459
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,160
generalities so again it's one of those

460
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,020
things it's I I don't know Daniel

461
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,660
probably knows whether it's a where's

462
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,419
Waldo's thing or you know some sort of

463
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,480
uh artist that they came up with some

464
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,460
strange Twist on things but but the

465
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,039
bottom line is spend a few minutes have

466
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,380
a look because you'll want to go through

467
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,340
your own building of what these

468
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,960
relationships are and you'll also want

469
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
to be able to consolidate if you I

470
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,220
wasn't there when this representation

471
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,460
was built but I do know that I want to

472
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,799
be able to both look at it do a

473
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,380
comparative analysis to what I think the

474
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
Institute should be and then be able to

475
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,080
consolidate

476
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,120
awesome yeah just a few notes on this

477
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
and to give a visual overview since it

478
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
may be clearer to see this then go

479
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,280
through the pros that essentially

480
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,460
describes it as much later on

481
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,559
the Golden Ring represents the active

482
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,260
inference ecosystem and I think we could

483
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,120
talk about golden rings for a long time

484
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,640
to come but coming in from the ecosystem

485
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,960
on the bottom

486
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,460
bottom for the reader not from the other

487
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,480
side of the table

488
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,059
are the projects and all the projects

489
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,120
are participatory Endeavors they're

490
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,020
happening behind on and in front of the

491
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,820
golden ring depending on how you look at

492
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,299
it and that is the appendix and all of

493
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,220
those different projects that we talked

494
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,000
about and all of the iterations and new

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,980
threads that I know that we're going to

496
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,140
see in an hour and I know that we're

497
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,840
going to see in a month and in a year in

498
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,919
a century

499
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,880
and those projects are being supported

500
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,640
through to

501
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,580
units kind of like a department but an

502
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,799
organizational unit one centered on

503
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,559
education and one centered on research

504
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,780
the education unit is called Azure

505
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,760
active and the Research Unit is called

506
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,980
re-inference so right there you kind of

507
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,960
have active inference in case that

508
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,059
wasn't clear

509
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,240
coming from The Institute scale

510
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,760
supporting the unit scale

511
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,220
are a variety of functions such as

512
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,960
funding and Partnerships Communications

513
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,140
and hierarchical processes such as the

514
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,659
construction of enabling systems and at

515
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,400
The Institute scale other than

516
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,100
administrative functions we have the

517
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,400
officers the day-to-day operators of the

518
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,559
work the board of directors which is the

519
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,080
formal governing body and the scientific

520
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,480
Advisory Board where

521
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,840
we really want to call out broadly and

522
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,200
have people who may have or may have not

523
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,640
thought that they would find themselves

524
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,559
in a scientific Advisory board for

525
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,659
example in 2024

526
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,640
this is your invitation and we really

527
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,220
want to have a vibrant scientific

528
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,340
Advisory Board who serves liaison type

529
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,220
roles with different sectors and just

530
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,760
gives periodic super valuable High

531
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,299
leverage insight and then I guess

532
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,520
depending on how you think about it as

533
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,080
all things we have just a few terms

534
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
they don't just represent bricks in the

535
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,020
wall

536
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,860
but it's more of like the

537
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,039
the fibers we weave and some of these

538
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,340
are already things that we do every day

539
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,340
courses educational groups events live

540
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,520
streams ontology research others of

541
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,100
these are things that we know will be

542
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,940
coming into place in the coming years

543
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,440
and we know that the tapestry is just

544
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
going to continue to expand so it's

545
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,220
really exciting

546
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,120
on page six we have another figure and

547
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,159
this is just another way to represent

548
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,659
some of the functions that we serve in

549
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,120
the ecosystem this isn't the only final

550
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,460
or a fixed representation of the

551
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,320
functions that we have or the only way

552
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,780
to slice and dice or any of that but

553
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,460
just to connect some of the dots between

554
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,740
the functions that we do and want to

555
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,840
serve for the ecosystem

556
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,780
so starting from the broadest let's just

557
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,440
say where the listener is where you are

558
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,860
right now is in the space of awareness

559
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,799
and that happens through communication

560
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,179
some people who become aware through a

561
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,940
surge or a language model or a video

562
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,059
suggestion or a friend or happenstance

563
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,340
or synchronicity or however some

564
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,640
fraction of the aware

565
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,559
will pursue education

566
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,799
and about education we have and will

567
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,600
continue to produce the materials

568
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
documentation ontology courses live

569
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,820
streams and so on

570
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,320
education is produced and rests upon a

571
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,539
Commons it's an epistemic comments it's

572
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,059
a verified information environment and

573
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,460
that is really the space the wildlife

574
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,159
preserve as I know Dean likes to refer

575
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,720
to it

576
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,380
not jokingly at all and underneath the

577
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,980
commons is the support that does

578
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,659
sit between a participatory Commons and

579
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,419
a formal governing kernel

580
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,340
that support in the coming years may go

581
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,380
many directions but we know it's going

582
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,820
to involve

583
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,039
all of our favorite things like Hardware

584
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,440
software information

585
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,340
Behavior narrative and more and then we

586
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,260
have the

587
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,860
regular Institute scale governance

588
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,980
partnership sponsor and donor

589
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,500
relationships such that we can first

590
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,740
find a type of stability or

591
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,039
sustainability and then more actively

592
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,779
play a regenerative role in our

593
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,480
ecosystem we want to dispense micro

594
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,080
grants to people and we want to explore

595
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,900
paid internships and be able to meet

596
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,640
people where they are in their active

597
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,900
inference Journey

598
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,340
and

599
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,779
things have been happening to that end

600
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:32,640
and through many means since 2021.

601
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,340
on page six Pablo or Dean want to add

602
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,879
any thoughts

603
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,120
I'm super excited about the governance

604
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,340
the education and the game and tools

605
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,240
laughs

606
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
in an hour we're gonna see

607
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,120
the first active inference game this is

608
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,919
very fun

609
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,419
um

610
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,860
on seven

611
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,539
we describe

612
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,460
our vision

613
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,500
our values and our principles and just

614
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,380
to read the top level on the values and

615
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,200
principles they are active inference and

616
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,520
exploration

617
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,159
integrity and inclusivity

618
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,820
Dynamic internal modeling

619
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,080
anticipatory Behavior

620
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,200
and continuous development

621
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,360
on page eight we talk about some

622
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,720
priorities and challenge areas these are

623
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,640
challenges across multiple scales

624
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,039
they're challenges that individual

625
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,700
people face in their journey to learn

626
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,140
and apply in so many different

627
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,539
backgrounds these are challenges of

628
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,340
national interest these are challenges

629
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,159
of global emergency as well

630
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,860
these challenges are educational in

631
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,140
nature for example related to scientific

632
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,260
literacy and Workforce Development and

633
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,059
just general professionalization and

634
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,679
Changing Times

635
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,539
on the research side there are some

636
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,820
priorities and challenge areas related

637
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,640
to the fundamentals

638
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,279
of cognitive science and grounding the

639
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,620
cognitive science in physics getting

640
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,659
that integrative first principles

641
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:14,100
framework that we expect and prefer

642
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,620
about information science and diverse

643
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,000
intelligences

644
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,640
things are faster and different than

645
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,100
they have been and active inference is

646
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,140
perfectly poised for since making a

647
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,779
decision making in that space

648
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,360
user experience accessibility and

649
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,580
socio-technical Design

650
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,400
this is a major open question across

651
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,740
different settings so it's not uniquely

652
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,500
held to The Institute however we really

653
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,260
do believe and really will commit to

654
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,220
exploring new kinds of ergonomics and

655
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,520
onboardings and experience

656
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,679
so that we can

657
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,419
come through

658
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,419
and be how we want to be from the first

659
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,020
time somebody enters the game where we

660
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,640
can highlight accessibility meeting

661
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,860
people in the language that they prefer

662
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,159
to listen to and speak at the language

663
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,260
in computer language or at the math

664
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,820
level that reflects somebody's

665
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,559
preference in that moment

666
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,260
as well as being able to use augmented

667
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,720
and synthetic intelligence systems to

668
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,299
ramp up and even push the frontier of

669
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,840
what augmented people and other kinds of

670
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,299
collective intelligence systems can do

671
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,580
cyber and cognitive security

672
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,419
these also are broader topics

673
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,880
we've worked on these topics from an

674
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,559
active inference perspective many have

675
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,299
and we think that this is going to

676
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,820
become increasingly relevant as things

677
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,200
do

678
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
become more and more challenging and

679
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,960
uncertain in certain ways out there

680
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,140
scaling the active inference ecosystem

681
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,120
we've heard about this from the narrow

682
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,279
and tactical side we had estimates of

683
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,960
the computational complexity of

684
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,000
sophisticated inference about how many

685
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,980
computer operations have to happen for a

686
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,260
given calculation to play out and that's

687
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,640
sometimes called scaling active

688
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,679
inference like okay it took one minute

689
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,899
on one gigabyte of data so how many

690
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,279
minutes is it going to take on this

691
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,440
computer with this much data

692
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,480
scaling the active inference ecosystem

693
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,000
though is a broader question and that's

694
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,220
where we come to more of the social

695
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,100
Fabric and the real sense of belonging

696
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,380
that we all want to have and co-create

697
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,360
and provide for others in the ecosystem

698
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,899
and so this kind of scaling is really

699
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,880
transdisciplinary it's really skin in

700
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,600
the game it's as real as it gets and

701
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,299
applying active inference some

702
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,880
applications we've heard from today some

703
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,700
applications are cited in the early

704
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,520
pages of this paper and more and more

705
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,240
come through every day and we support at

706
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,940
The Institute various applications of

707
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,700
active inference Dean what can you add

708
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,059
in there

709
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,740
so here's here's a

710
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,299
here's something that never came up in

711
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,279
the writing of the document but I think

712
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,679
it's kind of interesting and I'm curious

713
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,299
what you guys have to think about this

714
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,940
175 years ago an institution came and

715
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,080
formed together it's called the

716
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,659
Smithsonian Institute now I don't know

717
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:25,320
if 175 years from this conversation

718
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,159
today they'll be the equivalent of

719
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,620
whatever the active inference Institute

720
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,419
is

721
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,419
175 years forward but I think it's okay

722
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,059
to start thinking in those terms it

723
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,880
doesn't mean that we follow in their

724
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,279
footsteps necessarily but I think it

725
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,059
means that we have a long-term View and

726
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,159
that the things that we write about

727
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,720
ourselves now

728
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,640
as Michelle's life

729
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,000
have some real sense of what we can't

730
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,020
there are things that we can and we

731
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,940
cannot change but if you look at this if

732
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,340
you look at the front page the landing

733
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,440
page of the Smithsonian Institute the

734
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,700
first thing that they say is welcome

735
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,760
which is what we say about the activated

736
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,620
difference Institute and then they say

737
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,480
the Smithsonian institution is the

738
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,820
world's largest museum Education and

739
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,460
Research complex we are a community of

740
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,640
learning and an opener of doors

741
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,419
join us on a voyage of discovery

742
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,059
so in three sentences they kind of sum

743
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,179
themselves up what's the formula for not

744
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,260
just existing for 175 years but being a

745
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,620
force

746
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,179
and I think again

747
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,200
um

748
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,120
Daniel whatever you decide to highlight

749
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,399
in the document today but I think we're

750
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,679
really trying to do is say do the words

751
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,080
that we put out now

752
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,779
will they continue to resonate with

753
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:55,740
people

754
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,559
for decades to come and again I don't

755
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,260
want to sound all hand wavy but I want

756
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,020
to hold up an example of a place that

757
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,080
really did set itself up to be something

758
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,059
that people could return to again and

759
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,740
again and again

760
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,539
and I don't think there's anything wrong

761
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,260
with aspiring to having that kind of

762
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,740
place that kind of respect and I think

763
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,000
that the things that you're pointing to

764
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,220
right now hopefully

765
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,600
set the set the the you know the

766
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,019
we're preparing properly

767
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,120
so that's what I'm that's what I'm

768
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,260
taking away at this point

769
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,460
we know about that preparation

770
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,620
measurement cycle from Chris Fields

771
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,979
don't we

772
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,679
we go on let's talk a little oh yeah

773
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,140
please Pablo go ahead no no definitely I

774
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,940
completely agree I've been thinking

775
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,960
about that uh for a long time

776
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,779
you do you want to build

777
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,220
um Act

778
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,240
uh for the best of the future and I

779
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,519
think to reflect that on the paper

780
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,699
it's super important so

781
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,060
yeah definitely up to do that

782
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,040
yeah

783
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,199
way ahead we describe some paths we want

784
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,940
to take but in in the history of the

785
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,918
Institute we describe our Origins but I

786
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,899
actually wanted to come to to figure

787
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,839
three and four on page 11 to speak to

788
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,339
building

789
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:29,580
one of the most amazing and encouraging

790
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,619
things has been the all ages all time

791
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,859
zone active build contribute mindset

792
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,540
and earlier

793
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,639
version of myself I might have thought

794
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,520
like hmm people who do variational

795
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,320
Bayesian methods in machine learning

796
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,879
they're going to have no issue

797
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,859
onboarding to active inference it's just

798
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,239
going to be like as simple as saying

799
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,219
yeah it's a variational Bayesian model

800
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,220
with action so just signal processing on

801
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,780
the inbound that's just control theory

802
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,220
on the outbound but if you're familiar

803
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,260
with variational bays and variational

804
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,780
free energy this isn't changing it that

805
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,460
much oh yeah we use a particular

806
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,960
partition and it's related to the free

807
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
energy principle but don't worry too

808
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,079
much you'll get there

809
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,900
I thought that that would be the

810
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,820
path for so so many

811
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,320
and

812
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,079
future analyzes will reveal what they do

813
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,579
or don't reveal

814
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,980
but what we found

815
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,560
in our

816
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,640
enacted work as it really played out

817
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,240
that there was inclusion and unique

818
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,020
contributions to conversations ranging

819
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,020
from philosophy of science

820
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,380
to fundamentals of statistics and meta

821
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,060
science and the role of quantitative

822
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,460
studies and social systems all these

823
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,099
amazing topics and people who just

824
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,640
scampered so rapidly through

825
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,220
the prerequisite what could be seen as

826
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,500
prerequisite from a disciplinary

827
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,240
perspective

828
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,339
was be was facilitated by the

829
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,920
recognition that one was already

830
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
in the space and in the way that they

831
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,740
needed to be to be an act of inference

832
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,079
and that was not

833
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,780
written out before and even now the

834
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,119
traces are barely recorded but it will

835
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,099
become to be understood more fully

836
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,280
and to your point Daniel

837
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,339
I think especially what the pie chart

838
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,220
shows is the actual

839
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,660
Spectrum aspect of this so I know that

840
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,579
right now that that maybe the

841
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,880
neuroscience and the psychology piece

842
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,640
take up a bigger portion

843
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,740
but I think one of the things that we're

844
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,040
trying to promote is the idea that um

845
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,320
you can come from just about any

846
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,760
background

847
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,180
as opposed to Oh all all paths lead to

848
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,520
like as you said an earlier version of

849
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,740
you said oh okay well I can see where

850
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,260
everything is gonna where the Confluence

851
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,579
is going to

852
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,859
no I think what this District this

853
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,900
demonstrates is that it's actually

854
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,940
becoming more distributed

855
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,040
the longer we

856
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,599
we continue to to exist

857
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,760
yeah this figure

858
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
of course I'm super happy with

859
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,420
everything that we were able to do but

860
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,280
this figure is like almost a little bit

861
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,140
like a um

862
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,020
like a a paper Target that we're just

863
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,920
going to blow out later because it was a

864
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,520
fraction of only people who had formal

865
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,260
affiliations listed which means only

866
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,760
people for whom we had done full

867
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,980
literature based polling up their

868
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,859
information so it doesn't even represent

869
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,579
the actual participation profile

870
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:02,339
this is more like the invitation list

871
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,560
for live streams

872
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,880
so

873
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,260
we are going to see another long a long

874
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,940
tail that

875
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,980
covers the part that's not the long tail

876
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,820
I believe

877
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,660
um

878
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,780
the rest of the paper continues along

879
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,359
possibilities challenges next steps

880
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,900
more about the Institute organization

881
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,320
various other pieces of information that

882
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,540
potentially eager stakeholders or

883
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:37,380
participants or donors or Liaisons or

884
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,520
other

885
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,740
people would like to learn more about

886
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,980
it's there to engage with we want people

887
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,760
to hop into our Discord and continue the

888
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,180
conversation or email us or otherwise

889
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,680
get involved

890
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,680
it's why we called this Symposium

891
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,540
enacting ecosystems of shared

892
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,140
intelligence at the of course relevant

893
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,300
suggestion of Carl friston

894
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,119
because we really do want to enact it so

895
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,619
if you feel like you're on the sideline

896
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,420
waiting to jump in or you're on the

897
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,400
beach and people are out there surfing

898
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,720
the 100 foot wave then maybe it's time

899
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,740
to get more involved so I will leave the

900
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,160
closing word first to Dean then Pablo

901
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,980
and then we'll go to raf's presentation

902
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,440
well just real quick again if you have

903
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,960
if you want to Consolidated document

904
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,560
that speaks to the now but also points

905
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,619
to a direction that we none of us really

906
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,040
know is is certain but is also really

907
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,779
exciting have a look at the doc

908
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,220
Pablo

909
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,220
um yeah I'm here huh

910
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:01,680
to make sure that I act as one of those

911
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,140
people of all backgrounds and

912
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,740
perspectives that has taken advantage

913
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,740
through one year of learning and acting

914
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,640
uh on this institute and hopefully see

915
