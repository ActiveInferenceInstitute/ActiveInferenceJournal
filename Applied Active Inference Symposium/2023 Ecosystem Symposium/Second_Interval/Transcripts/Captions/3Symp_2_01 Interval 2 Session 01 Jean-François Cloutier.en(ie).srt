1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,260
hello and welcome everyone welcome back

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,639
this is the second interval of the third

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,039
applied active inference Symposium at

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,500
the Active inference Institute on August

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,220
22nd 2023

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,760
this is going to be another pact and

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,240
exciting interval and we're kicking it

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,420
off with Jean Francois Cloutier a

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,300
collective of theorizers First Steps so

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,780
JF thank you for joining and to you for

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,940
this presentation and if anybody has

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,399
questions for this presentation or any

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,620
of the others please just put it in the

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,379
live chat and I'll do it I can so thanks

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,099
JF to you

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,660
well uh thank you Daniel

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,840
um I'm a software engineer a company

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,660
called smart rent where I write software

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,320
for smart home systems and I also work

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,360
on a research project at the Active

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,880
inference Institute called the Robotics

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,600
and embodied project

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,420
my current focus is unsupervised

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,720
learning in active inference agents

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,420
in my presentation today which is titled

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,900
a collective of theorizers First Steps

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,240
um I'll first start with a brief recap

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,979
of the project

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,420
then dive into recent progress and then

30
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,060
I'll conclude with what I see as the

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,799
next steps of the project

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,579
well since 2017 I've been experimenting

33
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,960
with Lego robots and models of cognition

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,920
I do this for my own education

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,220
because uh like I think most of us I

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,259
understand something better when I build

37
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,100
it

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,240
what you see here is the my latest robot

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,580
model it's a Rover

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,239
it has a whole bunch of sensors and a

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,720
number of effectors actuators

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,400
um as a matter of fact Those sensors and

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
actuators can be understood as forming

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,738
the mark of blanket of my robot

45
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,459
last year I presented at the Symposium

46
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,160
about the history of the project

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,459
it's uh then status and

48
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,780
um it's ambitions

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,959
I presented a cognitive model that

50
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,959
implemented predictive processing from

51
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,540
an active inference perspective so they

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,519
were generated models there was

53
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,160
predictions there was prediction errors

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,660
and

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,720
um the these generative models animated

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
the robots so that they would roam avoid

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,019
obstacles uh observe their uh companion

58
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,080
and also in a very simplistic way build

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,160
a theory of Mind of the other robot they

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,360
could uh from observations

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,220
infer that uh the other robot had

62
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,440
defective food food being presented here

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,159
as a sheet of paper on the floor and

64
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,159
then would uh kind of try to track the

65
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,680
other robot to also get to the food

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
and and fun stuff like this the

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,640
implementation uh combined uh

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,720
multi-processing and functional

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Computing there was nothing

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,040
probabilistic in the implementation

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
I thought maybe you would uh see them in

72
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,760
action that's what's presented last year

73
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,659
but just to get a sense of what they do

74
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,700
I have two robots here

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
um one named Carl and Andy I named them

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,560
before I knew I was going to present at

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,299
the conference

78
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,799
um so uh they benefited from a number of

79
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,239
training sessions they uh learned how to

80
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,280
um uh find which policies would achieve

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,819
their goals better than others and uh

82
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,279
one here on the left found the food

83
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,060
Brothers right away but got closer to

84
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,660
the pedestal uh where the beacon is that

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,120
simulates the scent of food

86
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,860
um

87
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,440
fear was getting into a collision and

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,280
then backs off in a hurry as we'll see

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,180
the other robot observes all this

90
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,979
sees the other the the the robot backing

91
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,759
up as being in a panic and uh decides to

92
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,479
share in in this emotion and backs up as

93
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,360
well so you know uh fun stuff

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,120
the um since from the beginning of and

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,160
implemented a different cognition models

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
but they all have in common the fact

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,500
that they Implement a Society of Mind

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
um so what is a Society of Mind a

99
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,600
Society of Mind is a concept by which

100
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,479
um the uh the mind is not a monolithic

101
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,440
uh structure but a composition of simple

102
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,680
actors independent actors that interact

103
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,580
with each other in simple ways

104
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,740
that the view of the Mind was put forth

105
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,199
by by Marvin Minsky

106
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,120
um 50 years ago so this is not recent

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,100
again what I presented last year was a

108
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,740
Society of Mind containing a hierarchy

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,100
of I call them cognition actors each

110
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,660
cognition actor is an independent

111
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,740
process

112
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,919
each one has a scope

113
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,780
um

114
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,479
a level of abstraction as well so for

115
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,979
example you would have a commission

116
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,900
actor that's concerned with the location

117
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,240
of food

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,280
and it would have beliefs and

119
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,039
perceptions about food location and

120
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,900
these would feed into a higher level

121
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,259
cognition actor let's say food approach

122
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,840
which is concerned about getting closer

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,960
to the food and so forth and so on these

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,380
connection actors communicate again in

125
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,120
simple ways this is a Society of Mind

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,580
and and they communicate by emitting

127
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,280
predictions predictions about the

128
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,340
beliefs of other cognition actors and

129
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,740
they communicate by emitting prediction

130
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,440
errors when predictions made about their

131
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,460
beliefs by others uh are inaccurate

132
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,600
that leads to uh connection actors

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,139
processing these uh prediction errors

134
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,880
and combining them with their own

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,500
predictions to create a an updated set

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,740
of perceptions that are synthesized into

137
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,039
beliefs and these beliefs lead to

138
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,699
um actions in order to eliminate

139
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,740
negative beliefs and Val or validate

140
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,360
positive beliefs

141
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
now it's from the interactions of all

142
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,600
these connection actors that seemingly

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,380
purposeful behaviors emerge

144
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,500
so that was successful but learning was

145
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,880
very limited this um this hierarchy of

146
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,259
cognition and actors uh was given was

147
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,780
pre-defined and the only learning that

148
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,599
um a robot would would do was to

149
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,580
discover which action policies tended to

150
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,300
be more effective

151
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
so clearly my robots are not monolithic

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,479
um active inference agents

153
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,039
um so the question is why would I

154
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,740
use a Society of Mind architecture well

155
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,599
because I I subscribe uh to the uh

156
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,660
notion that all intelligence is

157
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,699
collective intelligence

158
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,819
and and this paper makes uh the argument

159
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,879
uh quite cogently and I'm going to pres

160
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm going to cite a number of papers

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,319
which were

162
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,639
important to the evolution of my

163
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,080
thinking this is one of them

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,659
this paper sees intelligence as a

165
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,860
process

166
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,080
and not a property it's a process

167
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,620
enacted by the interacting parts

168
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,958
as opposed to again a property of

169
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,940
individuals

170
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,820
so a Society of Mind is basically that

171
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,720
it's a it's actually a um a number of

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,660
interacting processes

173
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,440
um that together from which emerge

174
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
a perfectly intelligent behaviors now my

175
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,380
my own personal current definition of

176
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,220
intelligence is uh self-sustaining and

177
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,560
active sense making since making is

178
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,160
really important by autonomous agent as

179
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,300
system

180
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,380
in a dissipative and dynamic environment

181
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,480
and this guides

182
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,720
um all the work I do in this project

183
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,720
now if you want a um description a

184
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,200
detailed description of uh

185
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,320
where my project stood at the a year ago

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,380
there's a paper that was published that

187
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,839
I published on xenodome which you can

188
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,800
look up

189
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,940
now over the last year I wanted to move

190
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,899
away from a pre-built a given Society of

191
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,040
Mind and toward a learned Society of

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,560
Mind I wanted to see if

193
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,620
um I could program an autonomous robot

194
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,459
to evolve in Society of Mind through its

195
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,760
interactions with its environment

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,860
now one might think that programming

197
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,420
autonomy is an oxymoron

198
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,360
um it's it's it's it's it's a would be a

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,060
good point but I don't think it is

200
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,380
um if if the program I write and and

201
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,560
install my robots uh imparts uh

202
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,680
constitutive autonomy which is uh enable

203
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,920
the robot to constitute its own identity

204
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
and if it imparts adaptivity which uh

205
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,640
enable the robot to uh modify itself

206
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,260
from its interactions with the

207
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,600
environment then I think that

208
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,000
um uh the the robot uh will be truly

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
autonomous

210
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,700
now for uh autonomy to um

211
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,500
to exist inherently in the robot

212
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,740
something in the robot must be at stake

213
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,620
and in it's definitely it's in this case

214
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,440
it's the survival of the robots Society

215
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,019
of mind now

216
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,720
the physical structure of the robot is

217
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,560
not uh at stake it's survival is not at

218
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,540
stake unless of course it falls off a

219
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,320
shelf

220
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,839
but as I intend to

221
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,720
um have my robot develop its Society of

222
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,800
Mind from experiences I also expect that

223
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,019
if it fails that the Society of Mind

224
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,500
will perish in its attempt to to grow

225
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,200
and sustain itself

226
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,019
so that's what's at stake in in this

227
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,540
current and going forward in this

228
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
project is the robots survive the

229
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,279
survival of the robot Society of mine

230
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,660
and and this survival would be an

231
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
expression of being by doing uh the

232
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,180
robot need will need to act an interact

233
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,399
in its environment in order to uh

234
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,540
survive

235
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,300
now whatever sense it's going to make of

236
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,820
its environment will then be grounded in

237
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,940
this uh survival imperative in essence

238
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,120
the robot Society of mine will have skin

239
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,620
in the game

240
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,500
if this weren't the case then since

241
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,180
making would actually resides somewhere

242
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,100
else it would reside in in in in the

243
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,260
mind of the of the programmer in my mind

244
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,540
as I observe uh the robots but I would

245
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,180
like the sense making to be grounded

246
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,180
in the survival of the robot's mind

247
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,920
itself

248
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,560
so that's key

249
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,640
now what do I mean by an evolving and

250
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,399
growing uh Society of Mind so instead of

251
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,980
the given Society of Mind which I I

252
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,899
showed uh earlier

253
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,459
I want

254
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,600
um I want the cognition actors to uh be

255
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,459
created to connect with each other

256
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,139
dynamically through interactions with

257
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,360
the environment

258
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,940
um so I want an active uh

259
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,700
self-organizing

260
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,560
self-optimizing Collective of cognition

261
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,839
actors now is this feasible well that's

262
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,579
a big question

263
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,220
um in order to and trying to answer this

264
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,620
question uh I'll be

265
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,260
um also answering uh questions like what

266
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,380
must be given a priori and what can be

267
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,260
discovered well I already have elements

268
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,380
of an answer I know that the um the

269
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,420
sensors and the uh effectors and the um

270
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,820
the cognition the Primitive cognition

271
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,399
actors that wrap them will be given this

272
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,139
this will be like what you're born with

273
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,380
basically and there might be a um a

274
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,220
metacognition actor which uh role will

275
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,060
be to uh oversee and guide the evolution

276
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,279
of uh all other cognition actors but

277
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,019
that's that's my hypothesis

278
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,959
I can imagine a test environment for my

279
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,959
robot that will test its ability to

280
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,139
survive I can imagine for example that

281
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,980
um as the the robot moves around or

282
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,300
computes it it uses a Limited store of

283
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,279
energy it's simulated

284
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,279
and that store of energy is replenished

285
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,459
when the robot consumes food and that

286
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,420
would be by being on top of

287
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,980
pieces of paper colored pieces of paper

288
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,139
on the floor

289
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,700
um and I'm going to make sure that it

290
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,680
needs two sources of food in order to

291
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,240
survive right that would be represented

292
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,399
by a yellow paper and a green paper for

293
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,800
example so that to prevent the the robot

294
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,320
from just simply finding one one source

295
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,899
of food and just stationing itself over

296
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,019
it so the environment will also contain

297
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,480
obstacles so the robot will need to

298
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,560
learn how to navigate avoid obstacles

299
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,139
locate different sources of food get to

300
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,800
them and make sure that it it it

301
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,660
alternate between various sources of

302
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,139
food in order to survive and the um

303
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,680
Society of Mind that will evolve will uh

304
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,839
hopefully

305
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,000
evolve to successfully do this

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
else if it doesn't then it will um

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,260
shrink as resources uh disappear and uh

308
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,620
essentially uh die so that's what it's

309
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,380
at stake for uh this robot

310
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,540
now this effort employs a a number of

311
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,399
Frameworks

312
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,360
um

313
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,880
and by framework I mean a useful system

314
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,220
of concept and constraints that that

315
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,699
that guide uh the implementation

316
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,920
well there's obviously the the free

317
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,480
energy principle and the active

318
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,660
inference uh framework

319
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,860
um

320
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,160
however I see this the IC active

321
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,420
inference as and as if framework it

322
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,440
describes the what what must be achieved

323
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,180
in this case uh reduction of the agent's

324
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,699
uh variational free energy but it

325
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,620
doesn't guide me as to the

326
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,380
implementation how to build the robot

327
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,820
for this

328
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,260
um I need as is Frameworks and um I'll

329
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,860
be using uh two Frameworks one which

330
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
I've been using since uh the beginning

331
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,180
of the project which is uh the actor

332
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,139
model

333
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,500
uh the actor model uh views computation

334
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,060
as

335
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,380
um uh diversity of processes processes

336
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,000
that are independent have their own

337
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,399
private internal State and who

338
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,440
communicate with one another strictly

339
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,899
through messages

340
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,660
um yesterday in uh interval one uh Keith

341
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,600
Duggar uh presented on the actor model

342
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,199
and made the case that we should use the

343
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,759
actor model to implement active

344
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,459
inference agents well I wholeheartedly

345
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,780
agree with them

346
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,959
the other uh framework that I'm going to

347
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,500
be using is a special case of symbolic

348
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,619
AI called the app reception engine and

349
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,980
much of the presentation will be about

350
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,780
the opposition engine and its

351
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,379
implementation

352
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
so here's where we are uh is the project

353
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,040
is located at the intersection of active

354
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,640
inference as a domain the what and

355
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,059
Society of Mind as a architecture and

356
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,140
symbolic AI as a form of computing so

357
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,600
that's where the project is at this

358
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,020
intersection

359
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,840
you know so where to begin so I I want

360
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,620
to

361
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,980
um uh dive into uh

362
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,740
a more extensive form of learning and

363
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,520
the first step uh logically is to learn

364
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,580
how to predict so

365
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,980
um I want to

366
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,360
enable a single uh cognition actor we'll

367
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,240
start with a single cognition actor to

368
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,220
um learn how to make sense of its local

369
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,880
environment it's so-called unvelt and

370
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,460
making sense implies

371
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,100
as a at a minimum to be able to predict

372
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,080
incoming Sensations so it needs to learn

373
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,918
to predict

374
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,400
so

375
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,220
what will be given to a cognition actor

376
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,500
well a uh there will be a history of uh

377
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,640
Sensations uh broken into discrete units

378
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,660
of time

379
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,559
so time n minus 3 and N minus 2 and

380
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,960
minus 1 time n which is the the present

381
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,320
moment

382
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,400
so these would be remembered

383
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,380
observations

384
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,240
and then what we want to get out of this

385
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,039
is the ability to predict the next

386
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,880
incoming set of Sensations at time uh T

387
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,700
equals n plus one and plus two

388
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,679
and for this

389
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
to be able to predict uh future

390
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,059
observations we need some kind of

391
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,679
predictor function

392
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,200
that is learned from the remembered

393
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,480
observation

394
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,179
now this predictive capability can be

395
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,419
built in two very general ways one is

396
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,600
from statistics uh so doing pattern

397
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
analysis and and being able to predict

398
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,760
what's most probable which is the

399
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,580
standard Uh current machine learning

400
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,419
approach or we could predict from an

401
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,440
understanding of uh the observations by

402
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
developing a causal model

403
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,480
uh of these of what uh produce these

404
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,500
Sensations

405
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,160
and from this understanding uh predict

406
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,940
what rationally should be observed next

407
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,660
so this is all about

408
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,039
sense making

409
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,880
and now what is sense making how do I

410
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,340
understand sense making

411
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,299
um

412
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,460
well to rationally predict incoming

413
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,580
sensory inputs uh one must make sense of

414
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,320
them that's what making sense means to

415
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,460
me

416
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,860
um and to make sense of sensory inputs

417
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,580
means to derive meaningful experiences

418
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,520
from them it's not just data it's not

419
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,340
just pieces of data it's a there must be

420
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,820
meaningful experiences and by experience

421
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,299
I mean a conceptualization of the

422
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,559
sensations

423
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,620
and a unification of them in time in

424
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,640
space so making sense of these inputs

425
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
will mean to

426
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
produce meaningful experiences that are

427
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,299
conceptualizations and unifications of

428
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,820
the sensations now an experience is

429
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,220
Meaningful

430
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,700
if it is underwritten by a causal model

431
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,360
so the experience is is uh

432
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,860
is perceived as the consequences of a

433
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,360
latent generative model

434
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,640
a generative process that we have

435
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,140
modeled

436
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,960
and I want meaning to be inherent to the

437
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,299
agent and that only happens if the agent

438
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,600
is truly autonomous and if this meaning

439
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
is grounded in the survival imperative

440
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,379
as uh discussed earlier

441
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,900
so how does expansing work

442
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,260
how can that be put into computer code

443
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,659
surprisingly for this we refer to the

444
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,520
philosophy of Emmanuel Kant

445
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,159
a reverse engineering approach

446
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,100
um asking himself what must entities do

447
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,100
to achieve experience

448
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,620
this is akin to the free energy

449
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,080
principles high road which can be

450
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,200
paraphrased as what most organisms do to

451
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,480
maintain their existence so in manual

452
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,679
con uh we try to reverse engineer

453
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,159
um cognition

454
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,080
um asking himself what's the minimal

455
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,600
cognitive apparatus needed by an entity

456
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,059
to have experiences

457
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,020
and and that he he documented in his

458
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,380
critique of pure reason just a a little

459
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,940
parenthesis

460
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,400
um the the meaning of the title critic

461
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,220
of pure reason is not what I thought it

462
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,539
was

463
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,340
um it actually translates more closely

464
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,880
to the case for a period recognition

465
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,700
a critique is is a legal term is where

466
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,460
you make your case and pure reason uh we

467
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,900
translate nowadays is a priority

468
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,280
cognition

469
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,840
so

470
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,100
um

471
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,559
his work wanted to establish what must

472
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,299
happen to create an experience that's

473
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,500
coherent

474
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,799
that is Unified in time and space

475
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,380
um and through reverse engineer

476
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,860
recognition as a system that is both

477
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,918
complete and essential that is minimal

478
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,320
okay so let's let's

479
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,419
um I'm gonna try to give you the uh

480
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:41,280
posted uh postage stamp uh version of uh

481
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,880
uh Emmanuel Theory uh focusing on the

482
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
synthetic Unity of Apperception

483
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,679
well first of all there's the real world

484
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
which is outside of our direct

485
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,659
experience uh it's the nominal it's

486
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,900
forever hidden from us

487
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,200
um as an as is uh reality but we do uh

488
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,659
it it impinges on our sensorium and then

489
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,780
so we have a number of intuitions site

490
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,539
sound touch smell

491
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,380
um that are initially uh separate and

492
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,039
and then we need to uh Network them

493
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,940
connect them both in time and in space

494
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,200
in space

495
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,480
um uh is is sound and and and and the

496
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,440
site uh describing a single thing

497
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,059
um uh is one thing uh behind or uh

498
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,039
inside another

499
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,679
um and in time is this happening before

500
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,480
after uh something else and and then at

501
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
a higher level uh meaning is given to

502
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,500
these uh networked intuitions Sensations

503
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,860
uh via Concepts and and judgments rules

504
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,940
uh which are generalizations as to what

505
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,580
can and cannot be

506
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,340
um and this is what we experience

507
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,200
now it turns out that a con synthetic

508
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,020
Unity of that perception is

509
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,620
um

510
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,179
a blueprint for automating sense making

511
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,200
um

512
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,659
and it's kind of uh interesting I think

513
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,419
that 18th century philosophy would be uh

514
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,779
relevant to uh 21st century uh

515
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,520
technology development

516
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,880
and this is what happened and and and

517
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,059
was published uh by Richard Evans and

518
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,460
and all in the paper making sense of

519
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,760
sensory input where um they developed

520
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,860
the app reception engine

521
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,799
they took um synthetic Unity of our

522
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,860
perception as software requirements and

523
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,820
successfully implemented uh them into a

524
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,380
piece of software the app reception

525
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,679
engine and applied it to a number of uh

526
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,080
exercises

527
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,980
um and where they got a very good result

528
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,460
so the opposition engine is in um an

529
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,860
instance of machine learning it's

530
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,600
unsupervised machine learning and it

531
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,260
operates on very small data sets

532
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,860
um and generates uh human readable uh

533
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,240
generative models

534
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,279
and when I read the paper I realized

535
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,799
well that's exactly uh what my robots

536
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,799
needed

537
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,799
so what does an app perception engine do

538
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,820
well given a a sequence of observed

539
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,919
States

540
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,820
it uh finds a generative model

541
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,080
that can recreate past States but most

542
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,740
importantly predict uh future uh States

543
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,580
and the state is defined as a set of

544
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,059
simultaneous uh observations Sensations

545
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,960
intuitions

546
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,179
so

547
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,480
an appiseception engine

548
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,760
searches for a causal theory that can

549
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,580
recreate observations I say searches

550
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,880
because this causal Theory uh is not

551
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
determined by the observations

552
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,320
um it it has to be found it has to be

553
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,200
discovered but

554
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,600
once

555
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,460
it is found

556
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,520
then it can be validated against the

557
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
observations and see and see if it can

558
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,039
recreate them and augment them

559
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,900
into the future

560
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,220
as well as into the past

561
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,000
so what what is a causal Theory

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,659
a causal theory is is a logic program

563
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,140
that has a number of components

564
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,840
um they're in the causal Theory there

565
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,039
will be

566
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,620
um the objects and the predicates from

567
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,740
The observed uh relation so from the

568
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,620
observations we can extract what objects

569
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,080
were observed and what properties of

570
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,400
these objects were observed and maybe

571
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
what relationships and these these

572
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,700
objects were observed

573
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,880
that's the start then we have latent

574
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,700
object types objects and predicates so

575
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,279
we may want to imagine causal Theory

576
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,240
imagines a hidden objects maybe in types

577
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,340
of objects and maybe hidden uh

578
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,980
properties and relationships between uh

579
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,580
objects uh latent meaning unobserved and

580
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,799
given both of the observed and

581
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,880
unobserved um uh uh objects and and and

582
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,740
and and

583
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,559
predicates it

584
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,820
derives rules

585
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,380
first of all constraints on those

586
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,720
predicates what's permissible so for

587
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,039
example being in front of cannot uh a

588
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,260
cannot be in front of B N at the same

589
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,140
time B and at the same time behind B so

590
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,539
an object cannot be in front of another

591
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,000
and behind it so they're constraints on

592
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,260
predicates

593
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,919
And Then There are rules that apply to

594
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
any simultaneous sets of observations

595
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,919
what what uh they must conform to Then

596
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,679
There are rules that given a state will

597
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,380
infer the next state and then maybe some

598
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,039
initial state from which we can uh uh

599
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,120
run the causal Theory

600
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,380
so what makes a causal Theory Unified

601
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,120
well first of all it needs to be unified

602
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,500
in order to make sense of the

603
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,779
observation

604
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,940
there are various Dimensions so if a

605
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,620
causal Theory involves a number of

606
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,299
objects all these objects must be

607
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,220
directly or indirectly related there's

608
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,559
no object that just floats in space

609
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,419
totally independent of the other objects

610
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,240
so they must all be related

611
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,940
um so they're they're spatially Unified

612
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,000
all predicates that make up the causal

613
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,059
Theory like

614
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:09,299
on off behind in front they must be uh

615
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,520
constrained so that

616
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,000
um for example in front cannot be at the

617
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,940
same time as behind or that a light

618
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,820
cannot be both turned on and turned off

619
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,760
so there's there's some restrictions on

620
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,940
uh the predicates and that creates

621
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,919
conceptual Unity

622
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,620
and then the static Unity where all

623
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,299
simultaneous relations must satisfy

624
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,820
aesthetic rules and temporal Unity where

625
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,360
all the states must be sequenced by

626
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,500
causal rules

627
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,520
we'll see examples

628
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,299
so

629
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,799
let's

630
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,679
start with a an example here

631
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,860
of a set of observations what we are

632
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,140
observing are two lights

633
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,440
uh and the lights can either be at any

634
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,840
discrete Moment In Time

635
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,980
either on or off so here we have a

636
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,260
sequence of uh observations uh and One

637
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,539
Moment In Time

638
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,919
the first light was off and the second

639
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,039
night was on then

640
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,020
the first light was on the second light

641
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,799
was off

642
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,740
then both were on Etc

643
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,740
and I put the grape bars there

644
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,380
um to show that maybe the observations

645
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,240
aren't complete so on one stage we can

646
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,520
only see the second light or there may

647
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,620
be other lights or other objects that we

648
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,600
do not see but that's what we observe

649
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,419
so

650
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,880
you feed these observations

651
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,320
[Music]

652
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,059
um in discrete time

653
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,460
into the our perception engine

654
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,440
and the episode perception engine

655
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,799
searches for a causal Theory

656
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,760
that when applied to an initial

657
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,000
condition let's say that the light a is

658
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,779
off and light B is on it will create a a

659
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,980
trace of uh recreated observations

660
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,659
that um

661
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:20,039
cover is a superset matches the initial

662
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,220
observations and if this happens then

663
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,039
our causal theory is a good one

664
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,299
now the causal Theory May infer uh the

665
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,880
existence of hidden objects hidden

666
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,100
relations and whatnot it may actually

667
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,820
need to

668
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,000
okay so here's a an example of a causal

669
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,940
theory that is generated by my own

670
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,559
implementation of the app reception

671
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,380
engine because I I re-implemented the uh

672
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,200
the app reception engine as described in

673
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,279
the paper by Richard Evans and all

674
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,799
and um

675
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,440
I ran it on this the set of observations

676
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,740
about lights on two lights uh one on one

677
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,559
off at any point in time

678
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,559
and it came up with it found a result it

679
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,440
found the result in uh 64 seconds

680
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,419
it was a perfect match

681
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,100
and it um it actually invented a

682
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,000
relationship which is called tread one

683
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,159
um which we can that's that's imagine

684
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,100
that it's actually means connects to

685
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,519
and it found a static Rule and a causal

686
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,539
rule uh it said that a light is on

687
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,320
at any moment in time a light is on if a

688
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,200
light that connects to it is off

689
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
and it found a causal rule that said

690
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,919
um a light turns off if it uh connects

691
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,159
to another light that was also off

692
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,279
so that's how the the lights change over

693
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,159
time their status is on and off and it

694
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,840
came up with initial conditions that

695
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,820
said that well

696
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,580
a connects to first of all that there's

697
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,980
an object one a light called object one

698
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,739
that we don't see but is there we

699
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,339
imagine is there that a connects to it

700
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,199
uh the light object one connects to B

701
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,679
and the light B connects to object one

702
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,480
so that's the causal rule that it

703
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,020
discovered

704
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,199
now if we uh run uh this causal rule

705
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,060
produce a Trace

706
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,359
and as you can see the trace matches the

707
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:40,260
observation it adds an a new object so

708
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,379
the coverage being uh excellent the

709
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,599
perfect in this case and our causal

710
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,879
theory is a good one it's actually a

711
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,139
perfect one

712
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,179
it's no it's not necessarily the only

713
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,599
one though

714
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,020
so is this causal Theory Unified

715
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,839
so going back to uh Dr Khan's

716
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,140
requirement of synthetic Unity of that

717
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,320
perception not every causal Theory will

718
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,119
do though it may

719
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,940
predict correctly it may not be

720
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,400
meaningful unless it is Unified

721
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,280
well is it we've saw the fourth

722
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,540
Dimensions there's four dimensions of

723
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,820
unification is it especially spatially

724
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,300
unified well all our objects are

725
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,680
connected

726
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,640
directly or indirectly to each other

727
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,920
that's good

728
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,560
so we have spatial unification

729
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,780
do we have conceptual unification so we

730
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,000
have this new predicate we have two

731
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,020
predicates right uh Fred one which we uh

732
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,300
translate to connects to and then the

733
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,280
predicate that says uh whether the light

734
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,839
is on or off

735
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,320
well we have a constraint that says that

736
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,160
um

737
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,520
a a light can only be connected to one

738
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,060
other light so red one has a constraint

739
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,140
on it that says it uh

740
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,040
uh it it's it's exclusive so an object

741
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,339
cannot have spread one to two objects

742
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,140
you cannot connect to two objects that's

743
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,060
a constraint that was discovered and

744
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,420
part of the causal Theory and also uh uh

745
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,280
implicitly

746
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,720
um a uh the uh on uh relation of the

747
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,020
predicate as the value on or off and it

748
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,540
cannot be both at the same time so

749
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,820
it's conceptually Unified

750
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,119
is it statically unified or are the

751
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,660
rules of static rules obeyed well uh for

752
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,640
example the static rule would say that

753
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,040
uh given that b uh connects uh to a if B

754
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,460
is off then a must be on so if you look

755
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,060
at any uh place where B is off a is

756
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,040
going to be on and you could do that for

757
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,400
uh every uh other uh light and

758
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,320
relationships between lights so they

759
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,260
they all obey the static Rule and the

760
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,680
causal rule says in for example here

761
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,140
that if B connects to a

762
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,740
then if a was off then B must turn off

763
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,940
so if you look at uh B let's say e or B

764
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,920
was off

765
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,040
um

766
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:32,060
yeah if I'm sorry if uh B connects to a

767
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,460
and yes

768
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,460
and if a was off

769
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,020
B must be off so if a was off b b comes

770
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,960
off the next step so that's correct as

771
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,400
well

772
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,000
so statistically uh we are true and

773
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,579
temporarily we are true

774
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,720
we are unified and of course that uh we

775
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,920
get a thumbs up from uh Dr Kant

776
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,980
our causal theory is Unified thus makes

777
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,400
it makes sense of the observations of

778
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,220
the sensory inputs

779
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,780
now it's no accident uh that um

780
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,300
uh can't would be would figure in an

781
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,820
active inference project there is a link

782
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,180
uh between active inference and Kant and

783
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,700
it runs through the the celebrated 19th

784
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,119
century uh German engineer Hermann Von

785
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,500
ham Holtz

786
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,079
he was a disciple of Kant and he

787
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,180
developed the theory of visual

788
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,940
perception that operationalized Khan's

789
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,220
epistemology and in fact it anticipates

790
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,820
predictive processing uh in 1995 uh

791
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,359
Peter Dane and Jeff Hinton uh developed

792
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,460
the elmholz machine name is in his

793
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,440
Hunter

794
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,119
um and it is a type of artificial neural

795
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,920
network that's trained to create a

796
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,740
generic model uh from an original set of

797
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,599
data and it can account for the hidden

798
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,060
structure of the data

799
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,520
so there's a as you see there's a

800
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,280
there's a link which is uh discussed and

801
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,320
elaborated in this paper which is very

802
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,599
very interesting paper

803
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,900
all right so

804
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,180
close parentheses so we've looked at the

805
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,740
perception engine uh from the

806
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,140
perspective of philosophy

807
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,940
so uh

808
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,740
now let's look at it through the lens of

809
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,260
machine learning

810
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,099
um

811
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,500
we the observations that constitute a

812
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,260
training set it's a very small one

813
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,180
and the application engine is uh the

814
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,180
learning algorithm and what is learned

815
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,660
the output is a causal Theory

816
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,320
um so the the learning process is is

817
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,000
unsupervised logical inferencing and the

818
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,420
um the output is a human readable logic

819
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,260
program

820
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,400
so we see here that there's there's some

821
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,060
profound differences with uh the more

822
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,859
popular form of machine learning in that

823
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:11,579
the training set is really small

824
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:16,380
um that uh the uh the product of uh the

825
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,859
the learning the uh is actually a human

826
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,920
readable artifact in this case a logic

827
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,339
program

828
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,500
so this is the training set

829
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,839
um uh as as inputted lights

830
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,700
led a

831
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,460
turned off

832
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,900
at time one B turned on at time one a

833
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,780
term on at time two be turned off at

834
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,180
time two etc etc

835
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,440
so that's the training set

836
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,380
and you feed this into the um uh

837
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,500
Obsession perception engines algorithm

838
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,720
and out comes a uh causal uh Theory so

839
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,420
in in a little bit more details uh what

840
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,960
the algorithm is and does first it

841
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,980
extracts

842
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,880
um the uh observed object extend objects

843
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,160
the object types and predicates from the

844
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,280
observations so we have on we have

845
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,339
object a object B we have led as an

846
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:24,960
object type so that's all part of the

847
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,760
observations and that becomes part of

848
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,520
the extent vocabulary

849
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,579
then the opposition engine

850
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,020
imagines

851
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,320
uh unobserved objects types and and

852
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,680
predicates uh for the relationships and

853
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,020
properties and that becomes a latent

854
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,420
vocabulary so there's a a step of

855
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,420
imagination then using the combined

856
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,820
vocabulary you know the both the extent

857
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,880
and and latent vocabulary combined it

858
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,000
looks for a unified causal Theory a set

859
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,920
of constraints rules and initial

860
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,839
conditions that uh obey the um the rules

861
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:04,740
of

862
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,780
um the constraints of uh synthetic uh

863
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,420
Unity of our perception

864
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,640
um once it has this causal Theory and

865
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,619
with initial conditions it applies the

866
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,960
causal Theory to these conditions and

867
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,339
produces a Trace

868
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:23,220
uh it recreates observations if you want

869
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,099
and and augments them and and extends

870
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,480
them to the Future

871
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,820
uh now it looks at this trace and

872
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,900
Compares it with the initial

873
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,780
observations for coverage and decides if

874
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,660
this is a good causal Theory or not then

875
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,240
it also looks at the causal Theory

876
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,280
complexity how many rules how complex

877
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,660
are the rules

878
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,300
Etc and um measures for complexity so if

879
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,720
we have a choice between two uh causal

880
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,140
theories of equivalent coverage

881
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,540
um the app reception engine will uh

882
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,420
select the least complex one using

883
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,980
Occam's razor

884
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,839
now if you look at this algorithm you'll

885
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:05,040
see that the the the boxes in green are

886
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,579
um not uh deterministic that's this is

887
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,560
where search happens we can posit

888
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,619
different kinds of objects we can find

889
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,839
different kinds of rules so this this

890
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,380
was this is where search happens

891
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,520
now

892
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,280
our perception is implemented using

893
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,119
logic inference actually it uses uh

894
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,579
three forms of logic inference there's

895
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,260
the one that we're more familiar with

896
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,800
which is uh deduction where given rules

897
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,579
and causes we we infer the effects then

898
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,859
there's uh induction where given causes

899
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,020
and effect we look for the rules this is

900
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,660
what science does right looking for

901
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,119
rules that would account for uh effects

902
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,380
given the causes

903
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,319
then there's abduction where given the

904
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,359
rules and given what we observe the

905
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,000
effects we're looking for the causes in

906
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,500
this case we're looking for the latent

907
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,960
objects the latent or relationships

908
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,880
between these objects

909
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,000
and then you can combine both abduction

910
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,640
and induction where you're given effects

911
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,079
essentially observations and you're

912
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,839
looking for both causes and rules which

913
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,420
is what the app reception engine does

914
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,940
and this is where in the um in the

915
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,099
algorithm uh these kinds of inferences

916
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:21,900
uh are at Play

917
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,300
so positing latent objects that's that's

918
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,160
a form of abduction

919
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,160
uh imagining causes finding the rules

920
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,280
well it's clearly a a form of induction

921
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,900
and then applying the rules to uh uh of

922
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,940
a causal Theory to

923
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,460
um some initial conditions to create a

924
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,200
trace well that's that's deduction when

925
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,060
we have the causes the initial

926
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,980
conditions we have the rules causal

927
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,800
Theory and then we produce a trace the

928
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,079
effects so that's that's deduction so

929
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,079
the app reception engine uses all forms

930
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,319
of logical inference

931
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,440
and and now just a reminder that um the

932
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,740
output of the perception engine that is

933
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,960
what is learned is actually human

934
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,480
readable uh you may want to compare that

935
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,619
to a a large

936
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:17,940
array of floating points uh produced by

937
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,240
a traditional the more uh popular form

938
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,400
of machine learning nowadays so here

939
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,740
this is what's actually produced by the

940
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,200
app reception engine as it runs on a set

941
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,079
of observations it produces

942
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,440
um a logic program that is human

943
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,180
readable the only when you look at it

944
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,400
the only thing you need to to kind of

945
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,619
guess is what does the what what is

946
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,480
meant by pred one and if you think well

947
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,460
maybe it means connects to maybe the

948
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,520
lights are connected underneath uh a

949
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,460
board out of sight of um

950
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,319
of the Observer

951
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,240
but finding a unified causal theory is

952
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,020
hard so we have to guess what the latent

953
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,359
objects and predicates are what what are

954
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,420
the hidden uh lights what are the hidden

955
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,060
relationships between lights and we have

956
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,099
to discover what constraints might apply

957
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,260
on the predicates

958
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,000
um and what are the initial conditions

959
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
from which we want to recreate a trace

960
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,160
uh what are the static rules that apply

961
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,099
to a simultaneous observations and then

962
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,119
what are the causal rules that given uh

963
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,520
observations at time T will predict

964
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,280
observations at time t plus one

965
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,260
this this is hard

966
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,780
as a matter of fact it's a non-polar

967
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,660
polynomially hard uh the search space

968
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,300
grows exponentially with the size of the

969
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,819
input which is the the the the the size

970
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:47,160
of the uh accident extent and latent

971
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,500
vocabularies and

972
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,780
so just like in chess you can't uh

973
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,599
predict to the end the consequence of a

974
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:56,660
move because of common neural explosion

975
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,579
with the perception engine you cannot

976
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,920
systematically Traverse the entire space

977
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,500
of possible causal theories to find a

978
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,720
good one because it's impossibly large

979
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,359
so the job of the aposition engine is to

980
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:15,000
find a causal theory in a ridiculously

981
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,700
large haystack

982
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,319
how to do this

983
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,280
uh in my implementation I follow the uh

984
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,839
the the the recommendations in in uh and

985
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,300
and I follow also the implementation in

986
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,359
Richard Evans paper by breaking the

987
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,480
search space into uh chunks

988
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,599
first I there's a region and the region

989
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,680
says

990
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,540
um so how many latent object types

991
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,520
objects and predicates will we allow so

992
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,500
what is the limit of imagination of the

993
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,480
cognition actors that is trying to uh

994
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,420
perceive a causal Theory what are the

995
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,339
limits of its imagination and within

996
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,740
that region

997
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,319
um of bounded imagination

998
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,300
um we

999
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,420
carve it into templates where we say

1000
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,819
okay we're going to use these latent

1001
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,300
objects types these latent objects and

1002
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,579
uh so basically what vocabulary specific

1003
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:16,680
vocabulary we're going to be using we're

1004
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,119
going to use object one we're going to

1005
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,540
use object uh thread one on top of the

1006
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,280
uh observed on uh predicate and observed

1007
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,460
A and B lights and we're going to set

1008
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,460
the maximum complexity on the rules and

1009
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,220
see if within uh we can find causal

1010
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,740
theories that fit this template so this

1011
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,079
is a carving up of the search space

1012
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,920
and having broken the search space into

1013
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,660
regions and templates

1014
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,920
uh

1015
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,440
we have Scopes in which to apply

1016
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,760
heuristics now why heuristics because

1017
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,579
the systematic traversal and it cannot

1018
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,160
be done in reasonable time there's just

1019
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,579
too many uh candidate causal theories to

1020
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,640
to look at to find a good one so we use

1021
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,740
heuristics we find

1022
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,220
we we find ways of maybe getting to a

1023
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,740
good solution faster at the risk of

1024
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,700
missing it but at least uh we'll have an

1025
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,339
answer or no answer in a reasonable

1026
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,200
amount of time and there's a number of

1027
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,780
of heuristics that I have implemented in

1028
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,880
my implementation of the perceptron

1029
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,660
engine

1030
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,940
well there's time boxing at some point

1031
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,800
you'd spend no more than this amount of

1032
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,740
time looking into a region or into a

1033
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,060
template

1034
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,339
oh there's multitasking well the problem

1035
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,260
is actually as they say embarrassingly

1036
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,660
parallel you can explore multiple

1037
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,160
regions and multiple templates in

1038
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,740
parallel and so make good use of a

1039
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,500
multi-core uh computer

1040
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,119
uh you want to make sure you don't

1041
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,700
repeat yourself so you don't want to uh

1042
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,339
Traverse the same region uh twice or

1043
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:58,500
look at the same puzzle Theory twice

1044
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,280
you want to satisfy you may be a good

1045
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,380
enough theory is just fine we don't want

1046
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,599
to look for the perfect one necessarily

1047
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,119
we may not have time

1048
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,220
um you want to fail early if you're in a

1049
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,380
region where nothing good is found you

1050
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,440
may want to leave it uh quite quickly at

1051
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,960
the risk of maybe not finding the a good

1052
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,720
one that is just over the horizon but

1053
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,520
you want to be impatient

1054
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,460
you want to throw the dice you may want

1055
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,640
to kind of mix it up so that every time

1056
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,260
you run the Apple Citron engine on the

1057
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,780
same problem uh you may find a solution

1058
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,920
a a different solution first

1059
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,440
um you want to uh go for The Simple

1060
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,780
Solution first you may not want to try

1061
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,119
everything to sample sum you want to

1062
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,300
start with the the easiest uh part of

1063
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,760
the the search space first be judicious

1064
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,980
and so forth and so on and most

1065
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,280
importantly be selective so reject any

1066
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,579
uh causal theory that would fail the the

1067
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,200
the constraints of unity of our

1068
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,339
perception

1069
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,720
with all these in place

1070
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,520
um the running my interpretation of the

1071
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,619
app reception engine gives pretty good

1072
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,680
results so here I I did a run this is

1073
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,839
not cherry pick that's decided to do one

1074
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,859
a series of seven runs uh and collect

1075
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:24,180
the data and show it and in this run I

1076
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,980
set up the app position engine to only

1077
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,520
accept a perfect causal Theory one that

1078
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,460
would uh produce a trace that totally

1079
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,300
covers the observation so and I did

1080
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,420
seven runs uh the first one succeeded

1081
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,220
founded in four seconds

1082
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,160
uh the second one it took 102 seconds so

1083
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,020
there's there's some randomization in in

1084
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,700
the order in which things have searched

1085
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,579
is luck is involved as I said

1086
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,619
um the third one one second that was

1087
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:56,280
that was pretty cool the the the fourth

1088
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,819
one wall took 204 seconds

1089
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:04,440
and then 96 12.99 so uh what a a good

1090
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,880
distribution here

1091
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,920
now I said okay I'm gonna I'm gonna run

1092
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,500
the perception engine again on the same

1093
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,900
uh training set that I showed earlier

1094
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,339
those two lights

1095
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,460
but this time I said um I'm gonna be uh

1096
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,700
I'm going to accept the theory that has

1097
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,579
at least that has at least 80 that has

1098
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:27,660
85 or more coverage so it it predicts it

1099
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,480
it it recreates the the the observations

1100
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,160
well enough but not perfectly and I uh

1101
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,200
time boxed it to 30 seconds so you have

1102
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,839
30 seconds to find It Go

1103
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,960
um the first run it signed a a causal

1104
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,920
Theory with 75 percent uh accuracy uh

1105
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,040
immediately then the same accuracy same

1106
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,160
coverage 10 seconds 11 seconds it hit 80

1107
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,140
29 seconds it found a perfect one then

1108
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,720
11 it found 87 coverage and stopped

1109
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,240
right there that's good enough 75 again

1110
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,240
100 is the first one it found above 85

1111
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,200
in 18 seconds and 75 zero seconds so a

1112
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,359
good distribution again so we're getting

1113
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,280
into a reasonable times we're not

1114
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,599
talking about hours here we're talking

1115
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,599
about seconds and I'm I'm hoping to um

1116
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,700
do further optimizations and bring it

1117
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,359
down to something even smaller so that a

1118
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,480
cognition actor can say uh uh I want to

1119
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,700
make sense of these observations

1120
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,200
uh

1121
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,839
query the perception engine and get an

1122
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,020
answer a causal Theory within uh maybe a

1123
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,460
couple of seconds That's My Hope

1124
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,020
now something interesting sir it so

1125
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,059
happens that what makes it hard for the

1126
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,619
app perception engine to find a good

1127
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:49,619
causal theory is formally equivalent to

1128
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,660
what makes cognitive science as a whole

1129
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,700
hard and that's this paper here makes

1130
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,339
the case and proves the case quite

1131
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:58,440
quotiently

1132
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,940
um so uh

1133
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,480
cognitive science wants to find models

1134
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,099
functions or algorithms that

1135
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:12,960
explain account for

1136
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,099
um situated behaviors so you you feed in

1137
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:20,339
uh you feed into this this the cognitive

1138
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,900
science machine

1139
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,780
um pairs of situations and behaviors and

1140
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,300
you want to come out of it a a model an

1141
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,140
explanation a a function or an algorithm

1142
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:33,300
that accounts for it

1143
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,440
well the the paper makes the case that

1144
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,040
if if if the explanation is is to be

1145
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,520
bounded in size then the the the the the

1146
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,260
problem is computable

1147
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,180
but is not tractable in the Senate

1148
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,319
meaning that it's come naturally

1149
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,420
explosive but once you have a solution

1150
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,020
it is uh computable and tractable to

1151
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,900
verify that the solution is good that it

1152
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,619
accounts for the um the uh the data that

1153
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:04,079
you're trying to understand well this is

1154
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,819
this is equivalent formerly equivalent

1155
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,440
to what the app reception engine is

1156
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,619
doing

1157
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:11,400
um

1158
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,160
my implementation was done in prologue

1159
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,220
uh I will not go into the details it's

1160
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,260
about a thousand lines of prologue I'll

1161
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,660
just say that prologue is a programming

1162
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,660
language uh that use uh deductive

1163
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,119
inference as its model of computation

1164
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,880
with backtracking

1165
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,680
um so essentially it searches it

1166
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,400
searches for a solution and will

1167
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,859
backtrack if it took the wrong

1168
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:40,680
um Branch if you want it and and and

1169
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,020
we'll look for a different way of

1170
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,819
satisfying a a uh a line of the program

1171
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:50,700
um so let's just say that it it makes

1172
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,000
traversing a search space uh it gives we

1173
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,380
get traversing the search points for

1174
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,260
free when we program in prologue I won't

1175
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,940
go into any more details but you can see

1176
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,300
some prologue code here and it's uh the

1177
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,020
fun thing is that um a a prologue

1178
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,960
program is akin to a logical description

1179
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,059
of the problems trying to solve

1180
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:14,460
I think it's very cool

1181
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,220
and the

1182
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,079
prologue environment was augmented by

1183
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,000
something called constraint handling

1184
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,640
rules which is an extension to prologue

1185
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,040
that adds abductive reasoning so

1186
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,020
basically in the program you can say

1187
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,359
assume this is true until proven

1188
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:34,800
otherwise and the uh the uh the rules

1189
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,319
the CHR rules

1190
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:40,380
um are there to uh verify if it can be

1191
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,180
proven otherwise

1192
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,819
so um again I'm not asking you to

1193
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,559
understand this quote at all but I want

1194
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,420
you to realize that this code is the

1195
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,059
code that actually executes a causal

1196
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,559
Theory

1197
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,420
um both the static and causal rules to

1198
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,119
build traces it is that small it's it's

1199
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,579
very powerful so combining prologue in

1200
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:01,380
CHR

1201
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,839
um I found extraordinarily uh powerful

1202
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,880
I'm very excited about it I'm a

1203
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,260
programmer

1204
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,940
next steps

1205
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,680
well next steps now that we've solved uh

1206
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,920
individual learning uh by cognitive uh

1207
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,119
actors

1208
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:21,960
well I want to move to uh beliefs from

1209
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,460
uh from the sensations and to policies

1210
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,640
to validate or eliminate beliefs

1211
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,200
um a lot of these beliefs actually fall

1212
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,119
out of our perception latent objects and

1213
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,980
latent relationships and properties are

1214
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,079
can be considered by as beliefs then

1215
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,339
there are other kinds of beliefs that

1216
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:44,700
can be uh obtained from uh what's been

1217
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,160
not perceived

1218
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,920
um they'll be introspective beliefs uh

1219
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,540
that uh uh communicate

1220
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,480
um how the cognitive cognition actor is

1221
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,300
doing in terms of competence

1222
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,920
predictionary rates

1223
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,640
um how well uh it's um its our

1224
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,059
perception is doing is and whether it is

1225
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,119
uh engaging with other cognition actors

1226
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,099
is it relevant

1227
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,980
I will have feelings which will provide

1228
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,099
normativity to these beliefs so if uh

1229
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:24,059
feelings are signals of uh risk to

1230
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:27,359
homeostasis loss of resources physical

1231
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,300
damage uh too many prediction errors so

1232
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,180
that's hunger pain and fear uh and

1233
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,640
feelings will take beliefs over time

1234
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,339
and

1235
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:40,280
tainted beliefs and Norm

1236
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,040
good beliefs bad beliefs will want to be

1237
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,299
eliminated or validated through policies

1238
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:49,859
um that will be synthesized by the

1239
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,540
cognition actor

1240
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,140
and each cognition actor Will emit uh

1241
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,059
make available to others

1242
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,020
um its API what what predictions can be

1243
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,700
made about the beliefs of this cognition

1244
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,660
actor what actions uh are available to

1245
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,140
others to be uh uh asked of the

1246
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,540
connection connection actor

1247
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,920
and then as cognition actors uh uh

1248
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,660
connect to one another

1249
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,960
uh as the connection actors formed the

1250
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,119
um belt of other cognition actors

1251
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,420
then uh the accommodation actor will be

1252
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,980
able to predict the beliefs of others

1253
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,400
will be able to

1254
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,319
compose policies made out of actions

1255
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,480
that are implemented by other cognition

1256
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,500
actors

1257
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,900
and eventually

1258
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,540
um we'll have a Society of Mind which is

1259
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:47,460
a bunch of intersecting uh uh Boon belts

1260
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,780
so um that's uh it

1261
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,140
um so I I see what uh the Society of

1262
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,480
mine is a complex system uh of

1263
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,520
collective theorizers

1264
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,160
and I'm gonna try going further this

1265
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,799
project to answer the question if uh

1266
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,900
Collective of theorizers can

1267
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,500
self-organize to actively sustain itself

1268
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,980
so thank you uh to the active efforts

1269
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,200
Institute for inviting me to present and

1270
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,119
for providing a home for this project

1271
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,220
and for the constant support and

1272
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,240
encouragement

1273
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,500
I'll see you later on Discord thank you

1274
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,640
awesome thank you JF just to conclude

1275
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,240
the session I'll I'll read two questions

1276
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,579
and let's maybe address them in an

1277
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:38,160
upcoming Robotics and embodied meeting

1278
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,079
so if you're excited about this project

1279
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,260
certainly we all are and about symbolic

1280
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,420
active inference join the Discord and

1281
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,040
participate in the Robotics and embody

1282
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,200
it but I'll drop these two questions

1283
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,119
from David Williams in the chat who

1284
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,880
wrote One how important is conducting

1285
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,559
this work in Real World versus

1286
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,260
simulation and two what tools or

1287
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,940
components are missing in the robotics

1288
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,880
toolkit to make this research easier and

1289
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,740
better I know those are things you have

1290
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,480
a lot of thoughts on so I'll look

1291
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,460
forward to uh discussing with you more

1292
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,480
thank you JF

1293
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,619
thank you peace

1294
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,740
all right

1295
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,399
see you
