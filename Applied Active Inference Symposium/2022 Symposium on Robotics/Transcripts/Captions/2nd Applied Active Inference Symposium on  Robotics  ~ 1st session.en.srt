hello and welcome everyone to the second

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,520
applied active inference symposium

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,399
hosted by the active inference institute

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,360
it is july 31st 2022

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
and this is the first session of the

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,839
symposium

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
the focus of the symposium will be

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,039
robotics and the presentations will be

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
centered around that theme

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,760

are

58
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,640
ah there she is

59
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,400
oh she doesn't have any listed here

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,680
either

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,879
and then finally we have one hua chen

62
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
with the talk called dual control for

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
exploitation and exploration and its

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
applications in robotic autonomous

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,080
search

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
and that's it so

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
with pleasure i introduce tim schneider

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,839
uh please take it away

69
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
yeah thanks a lot for the introduction

70
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,519
i'm just

71
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
quickly going

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
to share my screen i hope you can see

73
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,599
that all right

74
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
yeah

75
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,439
so my name is tim schneider and today i

76
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
want to talk about our work on active

77
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,110
influence for robotic manipulation

78
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,640
[Music]

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
so i think we can all agree that

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
manipulation

81
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
so there's some noise on the background

82
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,440
sorry yeah it never went i think we can

83
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,918
all agree that uh manipulation is one of

84
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
these central abilities that we need in

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
our everyday life like be it cooking

86
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
writing or using tools and you can

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
obviously think of a variety of other

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
tasks that also require dexterous

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,040
manipulation

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
however despite

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
this significance

92
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
of manipulation in our everyday lives

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
robotic manipulation is still a largely

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
unsolved topic

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,600
and

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
i think one of the main reasons for this

97
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
is that

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
usually in classic robotics how we did

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
it for years we always assume that

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
everything is kind of known that we know

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
where everything is

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
how everything behaves

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
but in unstructured environments this is

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
usually not the case

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
and so what we need

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
is very adaptive policies that are able

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,440
to react to changes in the environment

108
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
and are robust to

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,560
to all kind of

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
perturbations

111
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
so

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,880
what my lab focuses on or at least

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
in part focuses on

114
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
is applying reinforcement learning to

115
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,639
robotic manipulation so learn these

116
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
skills instead of programming them by

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
hand

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
however this is also not super

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,320
straightforward in manipulation

120
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,240
and one of the central challenges here

121
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,120
is

122
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,639
to

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,960
to perform the exploration so in

124
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
reinforcement learning we always have to

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,759
explore a task before we can complete it

126
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
like for example here in this task um

127
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
this robot has to move up this little

128
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,199
ball into a target zone on this tilted

129
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
table and what we usually do and what is

130
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
done here is that we just apply some

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
random actions in the beginning and also

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
throughout the the entire optimization

133
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,479
procedure

134
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
and we just hope that this will give us

135
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
some useful insight into how the world

136
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,280
actually behaves and how we can create

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
a high reward in these settings

138
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
but i think in manipulation this is

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
usually not the case because if we just

140
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
apply random noise we end up dropping

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,240
the objects we are trying to manipulate

142
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
we end up maybe destroying even parts of

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
the environment

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
so i think this approach is simply not

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
feasible

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
for interacting with the real world in

147
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
manipulation

148
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,479
and if we look at how humans explore the

149
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,319
world we see a very different picture um

150
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,240
so this is a toddler that has obviously

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
the task of building the highest

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
possible tower of these other piece

153
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,479
blocks

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,560
and what we can see is that this toddler

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
is not simply applying some random noisy

156
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
actions

157
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,800
this kit has actually a fairly directed

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
way of exploring it has an idea of what

159
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
is useful to learn

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
what might bring it forward or maybe

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
maybe this is not as planned but more of

162
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
an intuition but

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
but certainly this exploration is much

164
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
smarter than what we are currently doing

165
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
in reinforcement learning

166
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
and so to summarize this

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,759
exploration is a very challenging task

168
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,880
in reinforcement learning for

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
manipulation

170
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
humans if we take them as an example

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
explore very actively and in a very

172
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
directed fashion and the question that

173
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,960
we want to ask in this in this work is

174
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
can we do this with robots too

175
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,199
and so this is where we started looking

176
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
into cognitive science and also came

177
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
across active inference

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
mainly because it uh it proposes a way

179
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,840
well it proposes a theory of explaining

180
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,720
curiosity in intelligent beings and the

181
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
question was whether we can translate

182
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,000
this on onto robots

183
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,440
so i just for completeness i want to

184
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,919
quickly go over the basics so in active

185
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,840
inference we assume that every agent

186
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,599
maintains some kind of model of the

187
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,720
world

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
which consists of observations o

189
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
hidden states x that the agent cannot

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
observe and some

191
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,680
actions or policy pi

192
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,919
and the objective is to minimize the

193
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,199
price which is the negative log

194
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,560
likelihood of the marginal observation

195
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,919
probability

196
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
under the model of the agent

197
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
and it has the agent has two ways of

198
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,039
doing this the first one is inference so

199
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,639
understanding the causes of the

200
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
observations it is making

201
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
this is done by applying variation

202
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,159
inference

203
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
to compute an upper bound of this

204
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,919
objective which is called variational

205
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,120
free energy

206
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
and then we minimize this which

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,679
corresponds to finding a variational

208
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,120
posterior

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,360
for hidden states given the observations

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
we are currently making

211
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
and the other avenue

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
which is what got us interested in the

213
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
topic is um the selection of actions in

214
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
order to minimize this free energy

215
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,040
objective

216
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
uh so if we want to do this we have to

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,160
make sure that we kind of plan ahead so

218
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
we have to take an expectation

219
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
of future states we might encounter

220
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,480
given that we choose some form of action

221
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
and we take this expectation of this

222
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,560
free energy term and what we get out is

223
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,040
fairly interesting namely

224
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
we get this kind of formulation here

225
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
which decomposes into an expected

226
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
information game term and an extrinsic

227
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
term

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
and the way this expected information

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,519
gain term works or what it

230
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
what it encourages is to take

231
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
informative actions because this term

232
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,399
becomes maximal when we take an action

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
which causes us to learn as much as

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
possible about

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
the current latent state of the world

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
so for example if you're in a very dark

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
room

238
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
a very informative action would be to

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
turn the light on it's not immediately

240
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
goal directed or anything but

241
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
it will at least tell you where you are

242
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
what your surroundings look like and

243
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
and so on

244
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
and then the second term is this

245
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,959
extrinsic term and here the agent

246
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,480
maintains a

247
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
preference distribution over

248
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
observations this is a bit of an

249
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
unorthodox thing for me as a

250
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
reinforcement learning person

251
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,399
we usually simply define a reward but

252
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
here this extrinsic preference is

253
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
defined in terms of

254
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
of this target observation distribution

255
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,000
but this is also exactly the point where

256
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
we can inject a target behavior into the

257
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
agent by basically saying okay this

258
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
agent should

259
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,320
prefer to observe some specific

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,880
observation

261
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
now taking a step back and going to the

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
reinforcement learning part of this talk

263
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,079
again

264
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,839
so the problem statement that we are

265
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
looking at is a

266
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,000
finite horizon mdp

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
which means that there are states

268
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
actions and rewards

269
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
we assume that these states fully encode

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
the entire state of the environment so

271
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,440
this is there's no hidden state in the

272
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,519
environment

273
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,680
and the objective of the agent is to

274
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,399
maximize its expected return for one

275
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,959
episode

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
and it's

277
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
the challenge here is that

278
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,800
the

279
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
dynamics and the reward distribution so

280
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
these two distributions here are

281
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,839
completely unknown um so the only way

282
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,160
the agent has to figure those out is to

283
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
probe the environment with different

284
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,959
actions

285
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,440
observe the outcomes and then learn some

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
kind of

287
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
model out of this

288
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
i mean obviously there are also other

289
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
ways of doing this this model doesn't

290
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
have to be learned but in our case it

291
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
will be learned

292
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
now we can see reinforcement learning

293
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,279
through the lens of active inference i

294
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,000
just wrote down this mvp again from the

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,839
previous slide here

296
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,079
the first thing we need is to define the

297
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
internal model of the agent and we do

298
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,959
this in a way that we say okay there's

299
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,600
two models the agent maintains one is a

300
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
model of the dynamics and one a model of

301
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,440
the reward distribution

302
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,279
and both of them are modeled as gaussian

303
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
distributions

304
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,079
conditioned on on neural networks so

305
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,079
these are neural networks theta being

306
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
the neural network parameters

307
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
and this

308
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,959
introduces a

309
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
latent state now into the environment

310
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,399
namely the

311
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,200
neural network parameters so

312
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
um what was

313
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
x before in in the inactive inference is

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,839
now here theta the only thing that the

315
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,079
agent cannot directly observe which is

316
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
what are the optimal parameters that

317
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
describe what is currently going on in

318
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,760
the environment what the agent is

319
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
currently observing

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,519
and the second thing we have to do is to

321
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,000
we have to make the agent desire a high

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
reward um and we do this here by making

323
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
the reward part of the observation

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
so now it's observing the the

325
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
environment state and the reward and

326
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
then we are setting this um desired

327
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
distribution in a way that

328
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,560
it prefers high rewards namely by

329
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,600
setting it to the exponential of

330
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
a scaling factor of beta times the

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
reward at time step t

332
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
and if we do this

333
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,839
we end up

334
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,839
the with the following planning

335
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,519
objectives so this is the expected free

336
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
energy now but uh

337
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
everything puts into its place

338
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
um and so the planning objective of the

339
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,880
agent is now according uh to the

340
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,200
expected free energy to maximize this

341
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
objective here

342
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
which consists for one of the extrinsic

343
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,279
reward which is just the sum of rewards

344
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,519
the agent expects to encounter by taking

345
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
some policy pi

346
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
and then there's also this intrinsic

347
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
term again

348
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
which in this case here becomes the

349
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
mutual formation between the neural

350
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,720
network parameters theta

351
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,440
and the observation the agent is making

352
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,519
so ideally the agent wants to make

353
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,279
observations that are both

354
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,680
good in terms of reward but also have a

355
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
lot of information about what the ideal

356
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
model parameters are going to be

357
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
uh i just said that

358
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
exactly and now we can do the use this

359
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,399
to forge an algorithm out of that

360
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,720
and it it works like this so

361
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,839
we take

362
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,279
so in every episode we start by

363
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
resetting the agent to some initial

364
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,079
state

365
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,079
and then in every step we have to solve

366
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
this planning objective of selecting

367
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,120
a sequence of actions

368
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
that minimize the objective function i

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
showed here in the previous slide

370
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,800
we execute this action obtain a new

371
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
state and reward we store all of that in

372
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
the replay buffer and then after the

373
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
entire episode is done

374
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,040
[Music]

375
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
we use this data in the replay buffer to

376
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
perform the infrared step of

377
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,959
of learning our models and adapting them

378
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,000
to the data we saw

379
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
now the challenging part about

380
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
about this is to perform this

381
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
optimization here and the first

382
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
challenge here is already to compute

383
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,279
this term even for for any given action

384
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
so computing

385
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
the expected reward for for a given

386
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,560
action is

387
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
has been done before in many works and

388
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
usually here monte carlo methods are

389
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,079
used so um just explain estimating this

390
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
expectation via monte carlo

391
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
but this intrinsic term which is the

392
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
mutual information

393
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
is known to be fairly hard to compute

394
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
and so there have been a variety of

395
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,639
methods proposed to

396
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,399
to compute or to approximate mutual

397
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,160
information many of them rely on

398
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,600
variational inference or amortization

399
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
but the issue is that we would have to

400
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,830
do variation inference over

401
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,680
[Music]

402
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,440
over the model parameter theta which is

403
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,600
a fairly high dimensional vector and

404
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
also we have to do this

405
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,600
potentially thousands of times in real

406
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
time while we are

407
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
yeah while we're optimizing this

408
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,199
function here

409
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
and so this is simply too expensive to

410
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,759
do anything fancy like that

411
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,839
so what we are left with is a nested

412
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,920
monte carlo approximation

413
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
and nested because we have an

414
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,399
expectation of a curl divergence

415
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,639
this means we have an outer expectation

416
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,560
and an inner expectation

417
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,079
and we

418
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,680
we apply monte carlo for both of them

419
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
and

420
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
the good thing about this is first of

421
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,880
all it's very fast and it allows us to

422
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,320
represent p of theta by a set of

423
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,120
particles because we just we now only

424
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
need samples so we can also

425
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,959
just

426
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,800
keep these samples and treat the entire

427
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,920
model as an ensemble

428
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
but the disadvantage is that

429
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
we require quite a lot of samples of

430
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,880
data in order to to get anything done

431
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,759
here

432
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,399
because um we have this outer and inner

433
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,199
loop for every sample that we draw from

434
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,400
for this outer estimator here for every

435
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,599
example

436
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,079
of theta we need to have

437
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
nj samples of this inner estimator here

438
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
of theta again and this means you can

439
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
quickly calculate if we take

440
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
five samples on this outer estimator and

441
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,760
five on the inner estimator

442
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,400
we already end up with 30 samples of

443
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,079
theta so we have in like a yeah and

444
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,720
a quadratic growth in in samples that we

445
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
need in order to compute the sum is this

446
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
this

447
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,720
mutual information approximation here

448
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
and what is also important to note is

449
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,640
that each of these samples is a full

450
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
neural network that needs to be trained

451
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,400
and maintained so this is simply going

452
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
to be very very expensive very quick

453
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
and so what we propose to do instead is

454
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,760
something that is a bit illegal in terms

455
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
of math

456
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
or at least it will lose us a lot of

457
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
formal guarantees

458
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
and that is to use the same samples on

459
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
the outer estimator as we used in the

460
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,679
inter inner estimator uh vice versa so

461
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,360
to use in the inner estimator the same

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
samples of the outer estimator that

463
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,320
means we draw a bunch of samples once

464
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,039
and then um we use all of these samples

465
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
except the one we just now used in the

466
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
outer estimator to perform this inner

467
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
estimation

468
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,640
and again as i said we lose some formal

469
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,799
guarantees because what usually is

470
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,520
assumed is that

471
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
these samples are iad this is not the

472
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
case anymore right now

473
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
but we found empirically that this

474
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
actually improves sample efficiency

475
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
a lot

476
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
so i mean here you see a little

477
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
comparison we did on a

478
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
discrete

479
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,240
like a randomly generated discrete

480
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
probability distribution where we could

481
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,559
compute mutual information uh

482
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,000
accurately

483
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
and

484
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
here you see a plot of the error of this

485
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,160
sample reusing estimator the second one

486
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
compared to the vanilla estimator that

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
doesn't reuse samples and this is over

488
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
the number of samples so the sample

489
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
efficiency is actually much higher

490
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
even though we are losing these formal

491
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
guarantees here

492
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
now

493
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,360
this means we now know how to

494
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
approximate or get like at least some

495
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,440
approximation of this

496
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
of this objective but what is still

497
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,320
unclear is how do we actually

498
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,480
maximize this objective

499
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
like what kind of optimization algorithm

500
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,919
we are using

501
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
and the first thing we tried here was to

502
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
simply use

503
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,480
a vanilla cross entropy method

504
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,840
this is a fairly common choice in

505
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
robotics to

506
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
to use this method because it's very

507
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,799
robust and

508
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,039
doesn't require gradients in anything

509
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,320
and it's also

510
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,160
considerably fast

511
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
it works in a way that you

512
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
initialize some some gaussian parameters

513
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
um so you you always maintain this

514
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
gaussian distribution of your current

515
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
action distribution you initialize it to

516
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
mean zero and one variance

517
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,120
then you sample a bunch of action

518
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,679
trajectories from this distribution for

519
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,799
each of these you evaluate the reward

520
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,280
and then you collect the end samples

521
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
that have the highest reward

522
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,159
and for those you fit

523
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,159
the parameters of the current gaussian

524
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,640
distribution you have over

525
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
over actions

526
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
in order to yeah to gradually shift this

527
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,240
distribution towards areas of f that

528
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
have a high reward and if you iterate

529
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,320
this for a while you usually end up with

530
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,360
a fairly

531
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,240
fairly good plan

532
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
now the issue is that this applying this

533
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
delivers fairly poor results

534
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,760
and the reason for this we quickly found

535
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,520
is something that is called

536
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,280
detachment or has been called detachment

537
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
in prior work i should say i don't think

538
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
this is an established uh term yet

539
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
um and the problem works a bit like this

540
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,400
so

541
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
consider you are in this completely

542
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
reward free environment right the only

543
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,240
thing that there is is intrinsic reward

544
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
like that leaves you out to explore this

545
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,600
environment

546
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
and you start in the middle here of this

547
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,080
maze and you can either go left or right

548
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,320
and in green is everything that is uh

549
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,240
intrinsic reward so everything that is

550
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
not explored has a lot of intrinsic

551
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
reward left

552
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
and so your agent decides maybe to go

553
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
for the left side first it explores it

554
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
for a while but at some point decides

555
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
that now the more immediate intrinsic

556
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,559
reward is towards the right side right

557
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,200
because this part has been explored now

558
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
so on the right side it's easier to get

559
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,720
intrinsic reward

560
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
so it might switch over to exploring the

561
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,799
right side first and remember this is

562
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
distorted episodic

563
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,000
so

564
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,679
after a couple of steps this agent

565
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,919
always gets reset to the middle and has

566
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,720
to do this over again

567
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
and so at some point the writers may be

568
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
completely explored or

569
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
whatever and

570
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
now we are in a bit of a tricky

571
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
situation because

572
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
we're again starting in the middle

573
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
but

574
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
the entire right set is explored and the

575
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
left side is so much explored that in

576
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,919
the immediate vicinity of this state

577
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,600
there is actually no intrinsic reward

578
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,640
left

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,440
and because many planners and

580
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,880
many planners that work well on high

581
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,039
dimensional problems rely on very local

582
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
optimization

583
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
we found that um

584
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
that these planners are unable to find

585
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,679
now a trajectory that leads all the way

586
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,960
into this

587
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
into this zone with high intrinsic

588
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
reward on the left

589
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
and the reason simply being that in

590
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
cross entropy method in order to reach

591
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
this zone you would have to randomly

592
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,520
sample a complete trajectory that goes

593
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,760
all the way around this maze and ends up

594
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
somewhere here in the middle or like at

595
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,320
least somewhere close to the border of

596
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,559
of the intrinsic reward here and this is

597
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,360
usually not happening

598
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,240
the solution for this we found

599
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,280
is to realize first of all that the only

600
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
reason there is no intrinsic robot left

601
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
in this area here is because we already

602
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
explored it so at some point in the past

603
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
we must have taken a trajectory that led

604
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
us all the way around towards the border

605
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,159
here and stopped somewhere here and so

606
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
what we can do is we can simply remember

607
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
all the past trajectories we took

608
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,039
and use those as an initialization for

609
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,360
the cross entropy method to start off

610
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,440
the planning from

611
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,240
so the way this looks like is that in

612
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
the end instead of simply returning the

613
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,280
plan

614
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,039
we store the entire plan together with

615
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,520
the current state in a memory buffer

616
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,840
and then when we plan for the next time

617
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
when we start the planning we not only

618
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
sample from this initial distribution

619
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
we also sampled from this memory buffer

620
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,600
take into account all the previous plans

621
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,559
we had

622
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,760
and start optimizing those as well

623
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,679
and we found that this usually leads to

624
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,840
behavior that is very well able to

625
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,720
escape this area of low intrinsic reward

626
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
yeah and that brings me to the

627
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
experiments we did

628
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,039
so this is a task we designed to be

629
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,039
specifically hard to explore

630
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,360
so the task is as i said before to move

631
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,520
this ball into this target zone the

632
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
tricky thing is that first of all the

633
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
table is tilted

634
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
if the robot loses the ball it ends up

635
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,000
somewhere here in the bottom and it

636
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,159
cannot be recovered anymore so the robot

637
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
has to wait for the end of the episode

638
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
to continue exploring

639
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,640
and also the reward is completely sparse

640
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
meaning the reward is zero everywhere

641
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
except for

642
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
if the ball is in this target zone

643
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
and this means that the robot has to

644
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
explore this entire environment purely

645
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
based on intrinsic reward and without

646
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
any extrinsic signal in the beginning

647
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,880
until it discovers this reward for the

648
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,120
first time

649
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
so if we apply just like as i told you

650
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
before this classical technique and

651
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,159
reinforcement learning of just applying

652
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,080
some random noise we can see that the

653
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
ball gets dropped immediately every time

654
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,600
and even after like 5 000 episodes will

655
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,799
soon see

656
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,640
we are not able to

657
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
reach even one third of this table so

658
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,440
here on the right is a histogram of

659
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
positions the ball has visited so far

660
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,960
and we are completely unable to leave

661
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,760
the start of this table

662
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
however if we use our method we can see

663
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,600
that we actually

664
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
explore this environment in a very

665
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
systematic manner and achieve a very

666
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
good state coverage

667
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
or at least ball position coverage and

668
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
our agent is quickly able to find this

669
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,320
reward here and

670
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,400
find a strategy that consistently pushes

671
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,679
it into the right location

672
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,200
this is also reflected in a learning

673
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,039
curve here's a comparison with a bunch

674
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,000
of baseline methods we ran one is pets

675
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
which is just a model based

676
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
reinforcement learning algorithm there's

677
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
also suck and mbpo

678
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,480
and neither of these methods manage to

679
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
to find the reward

680
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,640
in the given time

681
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,760
uh so we wrapped it up a little bit made

682
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,080
it this task a little bit harder so what

683
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,678
you see here are um

684
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,559
are sorry holes in this uh in this table

685
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,120
so now this becomes amazed there's still

686
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,080
no uh no extrinsic reward in the lower

687
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
area and also up until here um

688
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
so that means that again based purely on

689
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,520
intrinsic report the agent has to learn

690
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,000
to maneuver this wall like this is a

691
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
fairly tricky task right to maneuver

692
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
this ball around the corners of

693
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,840
of this maze into the target location

694
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
um and although it takes a bit long i

695
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
longer to train here obviously because

696
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,080
this task is much much harder oh it's

697
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,679
also important to know once the ball is

698
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,440
inside of this hole is lost and it

699
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,919
cannot be recovered

700
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,640
so

701
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,159
although this is much harder and it

702
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,240
takes a bit longer you can see that our

703
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
method is able to to solve this problem

704
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,000
and push the ball

705
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,799
into the target location

706
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,640
at the end

707
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
so this is a bit

708
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,799
of a slower version of of this policy

709
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,559
and you can see that it is actually

710
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
fairly tricky to maneuver around these

711
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,799
corners

712
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,960
there's a learning curve here

713
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
unsurprisingly the baselines did not

714
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
manage to solve this task but i mean

715
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,559
this expected since it's harder than the

716
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,720
previous one

717
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
and finally we also evaluate our system

718
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,159
or our algorithm on the real system uh

719
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,640
so we built this actually in reality

720
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
and trained it from scratch

721
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,159
so there's no transfer going on no

722
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,799
pre-training and simulation or anything

723
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,480
and you can see here the behavior is

724
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,399
similar the agent starts exploring the

725
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,080
environment more and more pushing the

726
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
ball systematically around

727
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
and uh ultimately um discovering the

728
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,600
reward on the top of the table and then

729
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
finding

730
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,360
a consistent strategy of moving it up

731
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,919
there's a learning curve for this as

732
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,880
well

733
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
but yeah this brings me to my conclusion

734
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
so we presented an algorithm based on

735
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,039
active inference

736
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,360
that is able to solve very challenging

737
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
sparse reward manipulation tasks

738
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,480
and at the core lies this augmented cost

739
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
function that is derived from

740
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,360
the expected free energy and this one

741
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,200
like encourages the agent to perform

742
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,240
very directed exploration while also

743
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,559
maximizing reward

744
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,600
and

745
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,080
we demonstrate that this method works

746
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
not only in simulation but also on a

747
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
real system

748
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,120
and so to give you a bit of an outlook

749
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
uh i think what

750
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,000
is very important to note is that if we

751
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,840
compare to to human haptic exploration

752
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,720
we humans rely very heavily on tactile

753
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
sensing for all of this exploration we

754
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
have developed a variety of different

755
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
strategies for

756
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
for actively perceiving using tactile

757
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,880
sensing for example like rubbing an

758
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,039
object to figure out the texture

759
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,960
or what you can see soon in this video

760
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
like grabbing it with our full hand in

761
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,120
order to to figure out the shape

762
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,799
can measure temperature there's all kind

763
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,200
of stuff we can perceive actively from

764
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,840
objects using tactile sensing

765
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,799
and

766
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,399
tactile sensing is also something that

767
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,880
is being actively researched in

768
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,399
in the robotics community there have

769
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,080
been a variety of new tactile sensors

770
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,279
coming out lately one of them is the

771
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,240
so-called digit sensor

772
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,760
you can see it here and it works in a

773
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,159
way that it has a gel that deforms upon

774
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
contact with something there's a camera

775
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,840
in the back and some leds

776
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,679
and if there's some contact you can see

777
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,840
the deformation of the gel in the camera

778
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,600
which is giving you some kind of like

779
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
local tactile feedback

780
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
and i think it would be very interesting

781
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
to see what we can achieve with active

782
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
inference on

783
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,640
using tactile sensors although there is

784
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,559
a variety of challenges that need to be

785
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,559
solved i mean this is a high dimensional

786
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,000
image

787
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,679
the contact dynamics are much more

788
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,200
complicated and

789
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,720
yeah there's a lot to consider but i

790
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,399
think this would be a very

791
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,559
very interesting avenue for future

792
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,799
research

793
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,279
and yeah this also brings me to the end

794
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,600
of my talk i want to thank you a lot for

795
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
your attention

796
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
i want to thank my collaborators as well

if you want you can check out our paper

799
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,320
here under this

800
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
qr code there is also a project page

801
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
which will soon contain an extended

802
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,799
version of this paper that has been

803
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
accepted to iros

804
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
but i haven't

805
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,799
uploaded it yet so i will do this within

806
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,440
the next one or two weeks

807
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
so if you're interested in more details

808
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,440
i recommend you to check this out but

809
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,360
again it's not up yet

810
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,679
and yeah there's my contact details in

811
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,080
case you have any more questions

812
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,679
so um

813
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,720
yeah

814
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,440
if i got that correctly before we do the

815
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,200
questions afterwards in the round table

816
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
is that correct

817
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,240
correct thank you very much tim

818
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,760
you may exit and re-enter the stream

819
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
when we

820
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
go to the round table

821
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,600
okay thank you very much

822
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,559
and there will be just a few seconds of

823
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,600
a break

824
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,399
and then we will be going to the next

825
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,480
talk which is tim verbellen robots

826
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,399
modeling the world from pixels using

827
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
deep active inference so we'll be right

828
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,480
back

829
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
hello

830
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,679
[Music]

831
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,720
all right here's tim verbellen's talk

832
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,799
robots modeling the world from pixels

833
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,320
using deep active inference

834
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,440
thank you

835
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,000
so unfortunately i could not

836
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,519
make it live

837
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,159
but i regarded this talk for you and i

838
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,919
hope you'll find it interesting

839
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,120
i'm going to

840
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
highlight a bit of our research like

841
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,480
sketching out the picture what we work

842
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,279
on and put it short basically what you

843
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,519
want to do is you have don't have robots

844
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,760
that can model the world they live in

845
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,480
from pixels but basically we can extend

846
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,559
it to any sensing modality

847
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,960
uh using the factory entrance

848
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,440
so why do we work with robots well

849
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,799
basically

850
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,240
we figured out that if we want to have

851
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
something intelligent to build something

852
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,360
intelligent that

853
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,760
is actually doing something relevant in

854
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,919
the real world then you need to do

855
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,440
action you need to interact with the

856
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,919
world you need some kind of embodiment

857
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,480
and that's why we work uh with all kinds

858
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,760
of robots we have manipulators that can

859
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,279
scatter around grouse projects and

860
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,360
directed objects we also have navigating

861
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,600
robots that can drive around and fly

862
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,320
around so you might be wondering yeah

863
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,120
why are you looking at both navigation

864
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,960
and manipulation and then everything

865
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,039
there whereas all over the world there

866
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,960
are labs that are dedicated on like

867
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
manipulation as like a single domain and

868
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
navigation as another domain and they're

869
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
like

870
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
distinct like problems well the thing is

871
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,600
that if we take it from another approach

872
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
if you look at it from an active

873
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,039
inference perspective then it's

874
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,880
basically the same thing you're doing

875
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,960
the same thing and that's why we're

876
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,919
trying to combine

877
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,000
all kinds of robotic

878
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,120
problems

879
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,080
from this single scope and see to what

880
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,000
extent we can kind of address it and

881
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
solve them and and to compare where are

882
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,000
we

883
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,159
compared to state of the art in robotics

884
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,279
let's say

885
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,399
that's like our overall objective

886
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,800
so in this talk i will talk a bit on

887
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
uh sketch out what is the general

888
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,520
approach we're taking and then some

889
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,679
current results in both navigation

890
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,320
manipulation and some of the work in

891
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,480
progress stuff that we're excited about

892
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,800
and working on right

893
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,879
so let's start off with what is active

894
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,079
inference

895
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,560
uh i guess most of you will know already

896
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
but just to set the scene and grow

897
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,119
for at least next 40 minutes on the same

898
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,879
page regarding location and what do we

899
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,960
mean with the terminology

900
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,280
uh so basically active inference just

901
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,079
means to us we have our agent or brain

902
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,159
that just built a genetic model of its

903
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,320
environment which we call the joint

904
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,879
probability over outcome so

905
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,440
actions a and then some hidden states as

906
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,079
so your agent is distinct from its

907
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,760
environment it can

908
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
interact with the environment by doing

909
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,640
actions it gets some observation then i

910
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,359
try to model with a hidden state like

911
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,119
how is this environment

912
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,400
generating me

913
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,560
generating my observations and can i

914
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,280
model this through these mistakes

915
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,800
we use

916
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
the the single principle of uh

917
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,400
optimizing this this this uh this thing

918
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
by minimizing circle figurity which is

919
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
like another bounce on surprise or a

920
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,320
prediction error and importantly

921
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,079
not only you use this to model the

922
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,920
system to build a model of the world but

923
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,960
you also use this to select the actions

924
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
that you will hold that will minimize

925
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,240
your expected ability in the future and

926
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,040
like

927
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,200
looking at everything from this angle of

928
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
minimizing your prediction error not

929
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
only for the pulse but only for the

930
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
future this basically gives you a very

931
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,599
powerful mechanism to

932
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,960
start doing robotics

933
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,680
so

934
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,560
just some mods uh equations uh that's

935
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,320
that kind of relates to this this

936
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
reality concept so basically minimizing

937
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,599
the energy entails having this kind of

938
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,680
complexity minimization so you want to

939
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
have the simplest model that explains

940
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,079
your world where on the other hand you

941
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,839
also want to have an accurate

942
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,400
description uh of how the world works so

943
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
you want to predict your outcomes from

944
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
your states this basically means that

945
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
you're having all the information that's

946
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
out there in the world you can actually

947
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,000
have this in the state representation

948
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,400
but at the same time you want to have

949
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,040
your explanation as simple as possible

950
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,079
according to fire and this is the list

951
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,480
it's basically the variational

952
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,920
uh i was here which is like saying i

953
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,040
want to be

954
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
able to reverse the model like if i have

955
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
some observations i won't be able to

956
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,480
infer

957
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
what is the most likely state that could

958
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,880
explain whatever happened to now

959
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,720
and then

960
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
if you look at the future then of course

961
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,520
we don't know the outcomes that will

962
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,839
come in the future so now it's basically

963
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,560
the

964
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,960
same formulation you can have like

965
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
the expectation also considers what

966
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,800
might happen in the future so what

967
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,920
outcomes might i create and then

968
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,880
your

969
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,960
your expected strategy

970
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
becomes again like two terms one is the

971
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,079
instrumental value it's just says how do

972
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,800
i think the outcomes that i witness will

973
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,119
actually realize what i expect to be

974
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,480
what i want to be like it's like

975
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,800
realizing uh preferences

976
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
and in a reinforced learning context you

977
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,359
might see this attack reward symbol but

978
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,680
rather having it's coming from the

979
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
environment it's now more like something

980
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,720
that's uh intrinsic that defines what

981
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,720
you are as an organism and then

982
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,680
is like um gain like

983
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,400
how do i think my beliefs will shift

984
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,480
for what i think now that will happen

985
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
versus what i think my state belief will

986
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,000
be if i supposedly i get these outcomes

987
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
and you're basically searching for the

988
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,280
observations that will give you more

989
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,760
information about uh what you're doing

990
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,720
so

991
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
automatically you get this on the one

992
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,520
hand gold direct behavior but on the

993
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,200
other hand your your agent is also

994
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,880
driven to find out um the development

995
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,640
observations find out information in

996
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,359
this environment

997
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,320
but of course um we have this kind of

998
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,160
deep active influence flavor where we

999
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,400
basically want to learn this model just

1000
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
by feeding it data basically and we use

1001
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,280
uh these deep neural nets that you you

1002
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
know uh from from the so-called

1003
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,240
artificial intelligence nowadays uh like

1004
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,920
it's basically a functional approximator

1005
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
where you give it some data and then you

1006
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,680
can you can match any function with them

1007
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,800
and we use these then to uh approximate

1008
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,720
the densities that were on the previous

1009
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
slides so how does it go we have our

1010
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,880
observations or actions we basically

1011
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,960
feed those to a neural net

1012
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,040
which then represents this approximate

1013
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,520
posterior so this outputs like means and

1014
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,280
standard deviations of gaussian

1015
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,119
distributions and these are there like

1016
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,040
your posterior distribution so it looks

1017
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,280
like a bunch of multivariate reductions

1018
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,040
and this is then your your state

1019
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,560
representation like what's happening

1020
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,480
right now given the

1021
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
observations i had until now

1022
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,560
then we have a

1023
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,839
new an additional neural nets that then

1024
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,440
like predicts the dynamics in the

1025
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
slaving stages like if i do these

1026
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,599
actions how will my state evolve in the

1027
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,400
future

1028
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,599
this now puts again uh parameters of uh

1029
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,760
gaussian institutions for example and

1030
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,599
this allows me to plan in this latent

1031
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,280
state space like what will happen if i

1032
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,640
do this or that

1033
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,720
and in order to kind of train them all

1034
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,959
from

1035
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
that then tries to predict the

1036
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,119
observations that you expect to see from

1037
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,040
the state and so the

1038
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,119
the trading mechanism is then minimizing

1039
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,440
the energy which entails it

1040
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
here you have your

1041
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,079
accuracy

1042
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,920
minimization so you minimize your

1043
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,079
constriction error but at the same time

1044
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,920
you minimize complexity with which

1045
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,440
basically boils down to the l divergence

1046
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,800
this thing and this thing is like

1047
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,319
what i expect

1048
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,960
to happen uh without observations i

1049
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,480
wanted to have it so as close as

1050
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,680
possible to what i expect has happened

1051
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,160
given that i saw the observations and by

1052
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,839
minimizing the scale divergence you

1053
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,440
basically of course small to have like

1054
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,920
very concise um

1055
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,280
encoding that allows you to imagine

1056
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
what might happen and at the same time

1057
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,040
emerging information coming from your

1058
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,520
outcomes but not

1059
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,440
more than as necessary so you don't want

1060
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,599
to necessarily model all the details in

1061
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,240
your in your pixels for example as long

1062
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,560
as you have enough information to

1063
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,520
predict uh sufficiently

1064
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,839
so that's like

1065
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,560
roughly at the approach

1066
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,119
and so now we look at some instances uh

1067
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,359
in in robotics cases and we'll start

1068
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,839
with the navigation so in this case we

1069
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,480
have roles like these

1070
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,640
you know but then with some

1071
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,400
additional sensors mounted on top of

1072
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
them so we can get get all kind of

1073
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
inputs we just drive them around this

1074
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,640
map environment where we have rex that

1075
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,960
simulate kind of a warehouse setup and

1076
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,240
then we just

1077
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,920
train these kind of models that just

1078
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,359
have to predict

1079
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,280
for example from camera images what will

1080
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,160
i see if i do certain actions and then

1081
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,319
after training such a neural nets then

1082
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,200
this is

1083
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,720
the kind of

1084
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,200
thing that we get so these are basically

1085
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,640
imagined views from uh from a viewpoint

1086
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,359
from from inside this lab environment

1087
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,119
and now you can say okay what do you

1088
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,720
think will happen if i do certain

1089
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,599
actions

1090
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,160
and this is the kind of thing that that

1091
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
it starts imagining

1092
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,720
and these are four different samples

1093
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,400
from this distribution so you'll see at

1094
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,079
the beginning they're they're all

1095
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,160
imagine kind of the same thing but as

1096
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
the further you go in the future the

1097
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,599
more they disperse in their kind of

1098
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
modeling all kind of scenarios what

1099
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,480
spikes happen in the future and you can

1100
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,920
also see that

1101
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,079
even though the model is trained on long

1102
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,720
sequences it doesn't really capture like

1103
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,920
long term

1104
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,359
dependencies or like very accurate uh

1105
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,240
location information like here if i turn

1106
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,720
it around i will be facing the wall

1107
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,319
whereas

1108
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,720
if i turn it around or just another

1109
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,400
part of the severe things i'm in the

1110
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
middle of the you know

1111
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,560
i'm at the edges let's say so it kind of

1112
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,880
all has this inside the model that these

1113
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,240
are all kind of scenarios that can

1114
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
happen

1115
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,680
but because we condition these these

1116
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,920
these models on the action we can also

1117
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,480
generate kind of uh action condition

1118
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,160
samples we can say what will happen

1119
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,920
so it actually encodes these dynamics

1120
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,040
inside

1121
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
this model and this is just training

1122
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,280
from data from just driving around and

1123
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,200
learning to predict what can happen

1124
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,839
so

1125
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,599
one of the things that we found out is

1126
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,920
actually by by training such a model we

1127
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,560
can then after effects that's that's at

1128
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,599
runtime compare always your prediction

1129
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,680
what you think will happen to your

1130
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,760
posterior belief what's what's actually

1131
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,079
happened given your observation and then

1132
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,000
what's the yellow version between the

1133
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
two which is one kind of a notion of of

1134
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,079
the basis size of the model and if you

1135
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,880
then put like a new object like you have

1136
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,040
this stable header there and if the

1137
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,359
robot drives over it then this kind of

1138
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,440
dynamic dynamics is it has never seen

1139
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,359
before which should result in like a

1140
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,119
huge spike in spike and the robot is

1141
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,280
like yeah what's going on here and in

1142
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,599
order to show that this is not just a

1143
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,599
measuring the difference in pixels we

1144
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,280
also have this scenario where there are

1145
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,760
people walking by the robots which also

1146
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,520
happens when you're recording the data

1147
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,800
so this is kind of an environment

1148
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,200
scenario and then actually the robot is

1149
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,800
like oh yeah this is something that can

1150
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
happen i see some next

1151
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,880
is nothing to be surprised about so here

1152
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,119
you can see that it's more than just

1153
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,800
learning pixel dynamics it actually

1154
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,640
captures like this is a normal state

1155
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,960
versus this is a weird kind of dynamics

1156
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,200
and one of the nice things from from

1157
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,280
using these learned models is that you

1158
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,240
can actually put in any sensor so we

1159
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,079
focus a lot on the pixels because that's

1160
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,680
also nice to visualize and you can

1161
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,800
relate to

1162
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,720
how it looks like but we can also give

1163
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,520
it like a bigger uh lights you can see

1164
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,040
the lighter computer

1165
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,119
sweep and there's some ranging and here

1166
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,520
we have like a rainbow which is a bit

1167
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,160
more expensive basically

1168
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,560
i mean the range axis like

1169
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,960
something

1170
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,599
it just means is something going towards

1171
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,240
me or is it going further for me and

1172
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
also here we can then have like

1173
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,400
imaginations of the model like what's

1174
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,640
going to happen in this state space you

1175
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,560
already saw the pixels it also relates

1176
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,960
like okay this is how lighter scans will

1177
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,599
be this is how radars will be if i if

1178
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,280
i'm looking at the air i see much more

1179
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
reflections in the radar damage stairs

1180
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,359
if it looks at the air

1181
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,400
it has like only a few uh reflections so

1182
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
it actually captures all these dynamics

1183
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,680
from any of these

1184
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,839
modalities in this in this latent space

1185
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,079
so that's one of the strengths of this

1186
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,280
work

1187
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,040
but as i told you

1188
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,280
it it has very a very narrow like

1189
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,119
temporal depth that can predict for a

1190
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,680
few seconds maybe one second maybe up to

1191
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,440
two seconds but then it becomes

1192
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,520
dispersed and blurry so you cannot

1193
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,119
really use it for like long-term

1194
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,280
planning so we figured out yeah what do

1195
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,599
we need to do in order to

1196
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
use the system but then like do

1197
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,480
something more uh relevant longer and we

1198
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
figured out that what we need is go a

1199
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,560
little higher and make like an article

1200
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,480
model that instead of predicting like

1201
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,680
the next sensory observation it can like

1202
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,280
predict uh

1203
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,359
which kind of state you expect like a

1204
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,440
bit further in the future and then we

1205
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,920
found in this kind of model where the

1206
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,680
blue board is actually what you saw

1207
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,599
right now but then the red part has

1208
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,440
cycle

1209
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,760
where we kind of combine some some ideas

1210
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,400
from engineering from slab right what is

1211
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,040
the thing that you expect to be like in

1212
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,079
minutes or a few seconds there and it's

1213
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,079
actually like okay i'll do that at a

1214
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,160
certain location right now and in a few

1215
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,920
seconds i'll be at a different location

1216
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,160
and this different location will there

1217
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,720
be more the kinds of observations and

1218
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,839
poses that i expect to be there so if we

1219
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,760
implement such a model it basically

1220
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,240
boils down to having on the one hand

1221
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,599
this is

1222
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,599
abstraction of the sensory inputs which

1223
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,319
is what you you saw before and then

1224
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,480
together some representation of the pose

1225
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,560
so if you turn around you keep track of

1226
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,960
it so you know kind of uh where you're

1227
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,800
heading and you have some sense of fault

1228
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,200
integration and then these two combined

1229
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,440
then build kind of a map which is then

1230
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,680
becomes your your model of the world is

1231
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,920
then traversing this fabrics

1232
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,839
and then we get something like this so

1233
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,160
here we go it's set up uh so here we

1234
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
have the camera now we have a late

1235
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,839
encryption nation from the sensory

1236
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,319
inputs here we have the odometry which

1237
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,480
is very nice you can see it go over the

1238
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,160
place but then

1239
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,400
by integrating both like this rough

1240
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,359
sense of where you are together with uh

1241
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,280
what you think it looks like and then

1242
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,480
combining like if this pose and you is

1243
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,319
pretty much the same as what i visited

1244
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,160
before then it's probably the same

1245
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,079
location and you merge the two and so

1246
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,400
then you see that it actually covers

1247
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,359
different nails in the um

1248
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,920
in the lab and it actually makes sense

1249
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,680
out of it and it and then you can

1250
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,680
basically use this model also predictive

1251
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,520
what is this looking like and then you

1252
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,920
can use this to like plan longer in

1253
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
longer term things

1254
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,040
so then we go to the more manipulation

1255
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,240
kind of uh

1256
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,200
use cases where we have like a robot arm

1257
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,480
and we didn't have a camera in the

1258
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,720
in on the wrist so it's actually getting

1259
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,880
information what is currently looking at

1260
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,960
you might think yeah this is like a very

1261
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,680
different use case but again the way we

1262
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,400
approach it it's just an agent that can

1263
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,119
move around and its main objective is to

1264
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,200
predict what will i

1265
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,800
move around and then use that to kind of

1266
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,280
figure out how this first world works

1267
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,440
but of course now it has much more

1268
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,680
degrees of freedom but other than that

1269
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,920
the concept stays the same

1270
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,640
so

1271
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,160
here we basically have been

1272
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,040
similar thing where it basically learns

1273
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,119
other viewpoints from the information

1274
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,440
government so first we give it back very

1275
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,839
it's straight looking at the enemy board

1276
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,839
the table twitter there's nothing and

1277
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,760
then it's regal's work for all kinds of

1278
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,440
business like instructions for all kinds

1279
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,520
of poses in the workspace which just

1280
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,760
figured out and it was trained on like

1281
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
simple cases with some blocks in front

1282
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,200
of it in simulation then if you start

1283
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,800
adding observations to the system you

1284
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
can see how all the different poses are

1285
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,559
kind of imagining ah there was a yellow

1286
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,960
cylinder there so in these few points i

1287
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,920
probably need to imagine a cylinder and

1288
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,079
this way you can kind of

1289
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,359
start building the world and

1290
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,040
reconstructing the world from all kinds

1291
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,119
of viewpoints

1292
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,760
um so it's always predicting the future

1293
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,319
observations from the information it got

1294
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,920
until then

1295
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,520
and the model is improving as

1296
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,440
information but then you can of course

1297
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,400
also use the model to kind of

1298
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,119
assess which would be a good viewpoint

1299
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,760
that i haven't seen before that gives me

1300
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,280
some new information

1301
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,920
and then basically what we do is uh we

1302
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,200
use our this

1303
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,480
expected energy term to then uh

1304
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,520
drive the

1305
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,760
and what we found is that by just doing

1306
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,079
this mechanism in this case we also give

1307
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,319
it like a preferred observation like

1308
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,520
this uh

1309
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,839
blue cube uh the current observation

1310
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,760
doesn't looking at that in space i want

1311
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
to found it a bit is actually it first

1312
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,920
goes all the way up because that it's

1313
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,839
what it figures out we'll give it more

1314
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,520
information and then it will start

1315
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,839
zooming in and scavenge for the

1316
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,520
preferred observation and then stay

1317
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
there it was a

1318
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
really cool effect to see from just this

1319
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,599
principle that it works right now it

1320
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,559
goes up to to have an overview and then

1321
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,960
once it's uh explored

1322
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,760
the workspace you can then kind of vary

1323
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,839
it in normal viewpoint so this is the

1324
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,240
imagination state of the robot arm

1325
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,319
wandering around like we had in the

1326
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,440
navigation scheme but now with the

1327
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,359
arm action stage

1328
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,359
so it's again the same principle but we

1329
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,400
get

1330
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,839
some similar

1331
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,200
results then of course we were thinking

1332
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,040
okay we need to throw a lot of train

1333
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,280
data like different scenes of different

1334
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,599
objects added before it could kind of

1335
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,160
start imagining these kind of scenes but

1336
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,720
if we look at how we learn how the world

1337
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,119
works how the world around us is then

1338
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,119
then bubblers are actually looking at

1339
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,359
objects and and and manipulating them

1340
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,800
and looking at a single object at the

1341
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,040
time and that's how they learn to figure

1342
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,000
out

1343
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,800
this is the better way to to learn in

1344
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,760
the

1345
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,000
scenario how the world is working so

1346
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,319
that's then what we did instead of like

1347
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,839
having uh

1348
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,000
trajectories of random scenes we just

1349
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,839
made the robot look at particular

1350
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,559
objects and then predicts other

1351
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,880
viewpoints that still from that same

1352
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,640
object so it's always looking at kind of

1353
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,640
the same location and predicting how

1354
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,800
will this thing look like from this side

1355
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,920
and then

1356
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,200
you basically get something where you

1357
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,359
can imagine for this particular object

1358
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,599
this is how the dynamics are for this

1359
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,640
object

1360
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,160
and then we take a similar model but

1361
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,640
then we trade it on a different object

1362
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,119
so now instead of having a huge

1363
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,760
model that has to learn about any object

1364
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,839
around we can basically compress this

1365
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,839
into a very uh

1366
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,920
well very it's maybe a little brave with

1367
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,960
a much smaller real net um and then we

1368
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,280
instantiate a new instance for every new

1369
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,839
object that we created so we can give it

1370
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:02,839
max

1371
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,160
our a can or a banana and it can start

1372
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,000
imagining how all these objects look

1373
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,240
like from other views

1374
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,760
but then again we can give it like a

1375
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,280
preferred view

1376
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,599
and then all of our air which would be a

1377
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,880
trajectory that brings you to the

1378
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,760
preferred view and that's then uh that

1379
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,359
is what you can see here so then the top

1380
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,280
view is like like the target you just

1381
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,200
randomly give it a viewpoint and it

1382
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,920
figures out how to move in this space

1383
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,800
just by imagining how um

1384
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,480
what this kind of objects you'd like

1385
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,200
from from different views

1386
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,880
then you can also use this to kind of

1387
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,319
specify objects because if we if we then

1388
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,000
have a

1389
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,640
a random object that it either had seen

1390
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,280
or never saw before it can use all the

1391
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,040
models and just

1392
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,079
very like

1393
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,240
which which model is actually matching

1394
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,319
my prediction for what i'm seeing right

1395
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,319
now and this then gives you like an idea

1396
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,640
like it showed me that object and you

1397
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,240
can see here that for an initial view

1398
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,559
it's already pretty good at knowing what

1399
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,680
it is

1400
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,920
but in some cases you have like a very

1401
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,920
ambiguous viewpoint you cannot really

1402
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,880
distinguish the two objects and then you

1403
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,040
uh you can just have another view and

1404
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,880
that will then resolve the ambiguity and

1405
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,559
that's exactly exactly what you see here

1406
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,119
so the energy agent will look for the

1407
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,200
most informative view and then for the

1408
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,760
node objects it reaches like 100

1409
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,040
accuracy and then

1410
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,319
and for this particular case it's not

1411
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,640
100 accurate and why is it because there

1412
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,040
are objects that might be very related

1413
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,920
so for example if no it knows it knows

1414
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,480
about spoons and then you give it a fork

1415
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,520
and it's like

1416
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,680
yeah it's kind of looking like a spoon

1417
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,319
so i'm i'm i'm not sure but and these

1418
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,079
are the errors it makes but these are

1419
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,079
like sensitive because actually the

1420
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,240
dynamics of the objects are very much

1421
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,559
matching an object i know before and

1422
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,280
then if you query it like what would be

1423
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,520
a the next view you would like to see

1424
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,119
you typically want one with a low

1425
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,960
expected free energy

1426
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,280
but if we ask it like what would be a

1427
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
view that you don't want to see then you

1428
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,839
get this kind of uh uh

1429
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,960
imagination in the in the the

1430
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,880
rightmost flow where it's not like

1431
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,880
foreign

1432
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,079
or this particular view it's very dark

1433
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,920
so i cannot really distinguish it from

1434
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,599
anything and

1435
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,079
the mystery bubble in bottom right like

1436
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,520
yeah this is kind of looking like a

1437
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,000
banana so this is not the viewpoint i'll

1438
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,200
i i'll choose to go next but in practice

1439
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,040
we saw because these objects are so

1440
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
distinct and a random agent is also good

1441
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,440
at just integrating information because

1442
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,440
the chances are low that you actually

1443
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,640
end up in this ambiguous viewpoint so

1444
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,599
in this scenario it's equally well just

1445
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,599
randomly looking around but the more

1446
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,799
your uh your objects become ambiguous

1447
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,880
the more benefit you have from actively

1448
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,640
sampling uh a particular viewpoint

1449
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,960
yeah for sure

1450
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,920
yeah exactly so so immediate like the

1451
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,960
same thing as as using radar and camera

1452
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,440
for navigation it's like using textile

1453
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,160
and

1454
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,920
visual information for

1455
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,520
for just

1456
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,160
inferring what this object is like to be

1457
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,680
uh as a as a robot

1458
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,599
we haven't done a particular experience

1459
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,839
yet on on tactile because it's also a

1460
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,319
bit more difficult to kind of uh yeah

1461
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,040
just to simulate and and but yeah

1462
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,359
it's on our minds to do this kind of uh

1463
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,359
things uh but yeah it's a very

1464
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,720
interesting route to take a

1465
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,240
and so finally

1466
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,960
uh what we can also do then uh is look

1467
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,440
at a c with different objects and then

1468
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,599
say okay i want to i'm going to open the

1469
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,040
gang so i need to have the top view

1470
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,520
this type of

1471
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,760
circular gray thing inside the gold

1472
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,680
image search the only thing it will do

1473
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,200
is like randomly search around he

1474
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
doesn't see something alive and then go

1475
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,079
to the target but in our case

1476
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,319
you know the the system

1477
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,920
like this thing

1478
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,880
is probably more related to the can

1479
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,720
rather than instead of the sugar box so

1480
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,200
it will draw its attention to the can

1481
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,799
and then also yeah this is more like a

1482
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,240
top view and this is more like a side

1483
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,240
view right so it can imagine like the

1484
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,760
the thing it should the the movement it

1485
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,920
should make to go to the top queue so

1486
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,040
this is exactly then for

1487
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,359
it directs its attention to the correct

1488
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,440
object and immediately finds out

1489
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,359
the movement it should make to kind of

1490
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,400
get to a similar um so that's kind of

1491
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,200
the real powerful uh system and you can

1492
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,440
see this kind of like adding another

1493
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,599
hierarchical layer on top it's similar

1494
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,079
to the the navigation where you where

1495
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
you then have like an abstraction of

1496
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,920
locations now you have like okay i have

1497
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,839
an abstraction of objects being

1498
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,839
somewhere spatially arranged then i kind

1499
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,240
of infer where they are and how it

1500
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,359
should move

1501
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,640
in this space in order to operate

1502
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,760
so then to end

1503
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,680
something that reflectively and actually

1504
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,839
get resectively working on this is

1505
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,160
basically okay

1506
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,319
we now have this system where we can

1507
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,240
build a model where we can relate action

1508
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,400
to what is happening but one of the

1509
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,480
difficult thing is still like

1510
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,599
the

1511
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,240
further the further in time you used to

1512
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,040
plan

1513
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,520
the your your your potential of

1514
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,760
trajectories explodes it's like yeah you

1515
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,480
cannot plan using all these these fine

1516
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,440
grain actions so can we figure out like

1517
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,240
new

1518
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,119
sensible actions or skills that we that

1519
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,880
we can use to explore

1520
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,359
and so one thing in order to

1521
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,640
avoid this explosion of options is to

1522
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,000
amortize

1523
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,200
a policy to now betray again a function

1524
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,040
that is then more kind of habit policy

1525
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,720
that given the state gives you the

1526
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,240
action but instead of using a reward

1527
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,400
signal as done in reinforcement learning

1528
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,040
you basically give it an uh

1529
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,760
an objective that's more like related to

1530
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,119
the expected free energy so in

1531
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,200
in particular here we

1532
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,760
use what we call latent asian surprise

1533
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,920
which was like terminally invented to

1534
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,040
relate more to the oral community but it

1535
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,040
is just like the information game on

1536
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,520
your expected states basically and then

1537
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,359
we found that it actually found out to

1538
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,079
play these video games just purely from

1539
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,640
an intrinsic motivation and also if it

1540
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960
compares to other like terms that they

1541
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,480
add in the url 18s to get this this

1542
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,640
intrinsic drive we actually found that

1543
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,079
our method was

1544
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,559
either on bar or slightly better than

1545
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,680
others and especially in cases where we

1546
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,319
had some noise in the states so if if

1547
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,040
the observations are kind of noisy or

1548
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,680
ambiguous the more methods still up then

1549
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,520
it was it was more easy to outperform

1550
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,880
the others because

1551
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,599
they were like okay the noise is like

1552
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,160
very interesting so we're dropping noise

1553
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,319
observations although maybe they they

1554
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,799
don't give you extra information so that

1555
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,240
was um

1556
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
something interesting before and now

1557
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,760
we're actually expanding that like

1558
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,520
instead of having this is more like

1559
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,240
having an exploration policy but now

1560
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,240
we're thinking more like okay if we want

1561
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,319
to plan maybe we just won't have like a

1562
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,119
few distinct options that make sense to

1563
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,359
explore like can we

1564
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,119
can we kind of find some elementary

1565
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,079
skills that are worthwhile to explore so

1566
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,040
in this case we have again a robotic r

1567
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,400
and here we need uh we again explore

1568
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,559
using this this uh

1569
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,200
intrinsic drive for information gain but

1570
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,799
then we give it like 32 potential slots

1571
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,520
to learn policies and just have to

1572
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,040
find out which ones are uh good

1573
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,839
trajectories that in total allow me to

1574
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,599
explore the state speed together and

1575
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,839
then we ended up with like a manageable

1576
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,920
set of skills that we can then find for

1577
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,000
particular tasks uh

1578
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,520
and that's actually what the some of the

1579
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,119
things that we're working on right now

1580
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,119
so with that uh i

1581
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,760
thought thank you all for listening i

1582
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,000
hope you enjoyed it should you have any

1583
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,079
questions you can always reach out via

1584
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,880
email or via twitter

1585
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,599
and hope to see you soon

1586
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,760
the next location

1587
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,760
thanks

1588
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:58,559
all right

1589
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,680
that was tim verbellen's presentation

1590
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,319
robots modeling the world from pixels

1591
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,799
using deep active inference the next

1592
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,480
presentation is going to be by ben white

1593
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,319
artificial empathy

1594
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,839
active inference and collective

1595
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,839
intelligence

1596
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,359
hello everybody my name's ben white i'm

1597
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,839
a first year phd philosophy student at

1598
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,920
the university of sussex and i want to

1599
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,599
start by saying a really big thank you

1600
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,520
to the organizers for inviting me here

1601
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,319
today to share this research with you

1602
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,079
it's a real pleasure to get to do this

1603
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,119
even if

1604
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,839
it's just in a pre-recorded format

1605
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,559
um i want to say right now at the outset

1606
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,319
that this is very much a collaborative

1607
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,559
and ongoing project it's work that i've

1608
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:51,440
been

1609
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,200
doing with mark miller and daphne

1610
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,839
demacus and it's very closely related to

1611
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,440
the kinds of things that i do here at

1612
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,359
sussex

1613
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,000
so i'm interested in looking at the

1614
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,240
relationship between human human

1615
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,280
well-being and material environments

1616
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,200
i'm interested in things like ambient

1617
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,280
smart technology

1618
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,039
social media

1619
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,799
augmented and

1620
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,400
virtual reality

1621
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,720
and affective computing which is what

1622
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,799
i'm going to be talking about today

1623
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,880
and because this is an active infant

1624
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,520
symposium i'm going to afford myself the

1625
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,839
luxury of not going over the basics of

1626
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,280
the framework

1627
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,720
and instead i'm going to jump straight

1628
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,039
in and i'm going to tell a fairly broad

1629
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,640
stroke story

1630
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,799
about how we think active inference

1631
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,280
might be able to shake things up in

1632
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,400
affective computing

1633
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,440
so affective computing is a research

1634
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,000
program which as many of you will know

1635
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,960
uh aims to build computing devices

1636
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,839
uh capable of interacting with human

1637
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,319
users on an emotional level by

1638
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,960
uh identifying categorizing and

1639
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,319
responding appropriately uh to emotions

1640
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,880
in human users

1641
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,440
and just to give some examples we have

1642
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,440
the paper in the top right from the mit

1643
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,079
computing lab and this

1644
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,960
project aimed to put affective

1645
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960
interfaces into cars

1646
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,680
because any of us who drive know

1647
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,440
that there are certain emotional states

1648
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,839
we can sometimes find ourselves in that

1649
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,240
probably hinder our decision making

1650
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,280
progress sorry decision making process

1651
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,200
and that can have some pretty negative

1652
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,599
outcomes and so this project was really

1653
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,559
geared towards increasing road safety by

1654
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,359
intervening uh in the emotional states

1655
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,039
of drivers

1656
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,520
the two devices at the bottom so the

1657
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,400
screen on camera in the bottom center

1658
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,799
and the rectangular headed guy

1659
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:52,720
who's yellow these are jibo and robot

1660
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,119
respectively and these are therapeutic

1661
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,799
interventions that use facial

1662
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,880
recognition technology emotion

1663
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,839
recognition technology

1664
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,200
to

1665
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
learn about their users and then make

1666
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,400
suggestions for certain tasks or games

1667
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,280
or even clinical interventions that are

1668
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,200
geared towards supporting the emotional

1669
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,839
well-being of the user

1670
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,599
but as you can imagine

1671
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,200
these are not the

1672
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
dominant deployments of affective

1673
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,880
computing

1674
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,200
we mostly find affective computing now

1675
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,680
in industries like uh recruitment and

1676
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,200
marketing

1677
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,960
so for example

1678
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,839
uh companies like unilever and many many

1679
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,480
others use emotion recognition devices

1680
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,799
in their hiring process

1681
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,119
in order to analyze certain non-verbal

1682
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,000
responses and facial expressions which

1683
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,640
they say are indicative of certain

1684
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,039
desirable or undesirable uh character

1685
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,880
traits relevant to

1686
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,960
the job

1687
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,359
however um you won't be surprised to

1688
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,680
know that this has come in for fairly

1689
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,839
heavy criticism so there are certain

1690
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,000
kinds of worries about this technology

1691
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,880
um

1692
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,599
the first worry is that it is simply not

1693
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,520
functional uh that it's based on bad

1694
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,280
science and that it doesn't do what it's

1695
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,480
supposed to do

1696
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,799
and closely related to that to that is

1697
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,160
the um various kinds of ethical concerns

1698
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,559
uh mainly that these systems are in

1699
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,799
danger of propagating certain kinds of

1700
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,240
biases and prejudices

1701
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,359
so lisa feldman barrett for example who

1702
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,079
is a major leading light in affective

1703
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,440
neuroscience

1704
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,119
has come out uh fairly heavy against

1705
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,839
this kind of technology uh she's labeled

1706
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,240
it neophrenology and said that it's

1707
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,200
there's simply no way that it can do

1708
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
what the people who make it say it can

1709
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:45,920
do

1710
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,760
and this is because she says it's based

1711
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,400
on a very outdated theory of emotion

1712
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,880
which states that humans have six to

1713
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,640
eight basic emotions

1714
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,520
um things like anger fear disgust

1715
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,760
surprise and so on

1716
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,520
and that these emotions are expressed

1717
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,599
through sets of facial expressions which

1718
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,720
are universal uh across different

1719
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,880
cultures and different contexts and

1720
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,400
anybody familiar with lisa feldman

1721
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,240
barrett's work will know exactly what

1722
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,640
she thinks about that theory of emotion

1723
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,480
uh she's not a fan of it at all

1724
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,079
and the ethical concerns um

1725
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,119
have been raised by ai ethicists like

1726
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,760
berber biharni

1727
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,599
who's argued that basically the fact

1728
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,200
that these systems are trained on very

1729
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,680
very large data sets mean that they are

1730
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,079
inherently conservative and this is why

1731
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,240
they propagate certain kinds of biases

1732
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:38,960
so

1733
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,960
the two pictures of the hand holding a

1734
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,480
device you can see on the right hand

1735
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,680
side

1736
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,880
in this case it's google's vision cloud

1737
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,559
in the top picture with the dark-skinned

1738
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,720
individual that device is

1739
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,599
identified as a weapon and on the bottom

1740
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,839
that light-skinned individual it was

1741
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,839
identified as some kind of electronic

1742
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,920
device and there are other studies as

1743
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,359
well that have shown that emotion

1744
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,760
recognition technology just works

1745
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,079
completely differently on non-white

1746
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,119
individuals and so

1747
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,440
with technology like this making such

1748
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,359
consequential decisions for people's

1749
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,480
lives

1750
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,559
it's really really important that we

1751
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,480
start to get this right and we don't

1752
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,240
have these kinds of outcomes that we

1753
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,119
have in the current program okay so we

1754
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,119
need the strongest most up-to-date

1755
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,720
theoretical underpinnings that we can

1756
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,480
get

1757
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,240
and we think the place to start with

1758
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,359
that by

1759
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:32,880
the place to start in updating the

1760
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,559
science is to recognize that these

1761
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,799
devices are very problematically

1762
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,599
disembodied they're very superficial and

1763
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,599
they are inactive in the sense that they

1764
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,319
don't perform any actions and this of

1765
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,160
course is a million miles away from the

1766
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,160
way human beings interact socially and

1767
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,480
emotionally

1768
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,839
and we've known this for a very long

1769
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:55,440
time so we've known for example

1770
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,520
this example from luis pizza's work that

1771
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,480
emotions are not simply um partitioned

1772
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,880
off from the way human beings think or

1773
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,760
act actually cognition and affect are

1774
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,760
very very closely intertwined okay

1775
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,079
there's no discrete separate brain areas

1776
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,920
that only do emotion and only do

1777
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,280
cognition

1778
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,240
and

1779
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,839
furthermore

1780
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,399
research paradigms in

1781
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,120
cognitive science so embodied cognition

1782
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,880
for example

1783
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,560
tells us that actually we need to go

1784
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,799
even further than that and recognize

1785
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,359
that embodied action is an integral

1786
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,759
constituent part of how we think and

1787
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:32,799
feel

1788
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,040
and then the other ease that make up for

1789
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,759
e cognitive science so in activism

1790
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,600
activism

1791
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,359
extended cognition and embedded

1792
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,679
cognition have come together with niche

1793
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,120
construction theory in really

1794
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,719
interesting ways to tell us that

1795
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,439
actually we also need to consider

1796
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,960
how elements of our external

1797
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,880
environments can scaffold the way that

1798
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,279
we think and feel

1799
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,640
so

1800
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,399
this is where active inference comes in

1801
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,880
because we think that if we're serious

1802
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,759
about designing these kinds of devices

1803
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,279
taking into account these most

1804
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,279
up-to-date theoretical developments then

1805
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,520
active inference basically brings all of

1806
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,560
that in with it so active inference is a

1807
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,799
theory that really elegantly

1808
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,000
kind of intertwines action perception

1809
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,399
thinking um cognition and affect

1810
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,439
together

1811
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,679
under the unified imperative of

1812
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,920
minimizing an agent's surprise

1813
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,359
so that's the first thing that it gives

1814
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,759
us off the bat it gives us this

1815
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,000
unified computational

1816
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,719
unified conceptual framework that can be

1817
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,319
shared by researchers in different

1818
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,520
fields but mainly as the name suggests

1819
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,439
active inference really puts action

1820
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,198
front and center it's not some

1821
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,120
afterthought or just some kind of

1822
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,279
bolt-on gimmick

1823
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,040
and i think it's worth reflecting for a

1824
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,920
second just on how central actions are

1825
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,080
to the way that we interact socially and

1826
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,320
emotionally okay so human beings are

1827
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,360
very far

1828
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,159
from being a passive uh classification

1829
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,719
device we're constantly sampling the

1830
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,440
world and probing the world in order to

1831
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,600
get more information so that we can

1832
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,960
update our models of the world

1833
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,560
so imagine

1834
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,800
the following scenario which happens to

1835
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,199
me fairly often uh imagine you're on

1836
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,040
public transport and somebody's giving

1837
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,199
you a weird look or maybe they're

1838
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,440
scowling at you in some way

1839
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,840
we tend to not sit there and just look

1840
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,520
at their facial expression to try and

1841
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,920
work out what's going on we have other

1842
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,960
avenues um open to us so we might look

1843
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,880
behind us to see if they're actually

1844
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,199
looking at someone else we will probably

1845
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,280
look at the broader scene for some

1846
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
context to see if there's something

1847
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,040
going on that can tell us more about

1848
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,920
that scowl or depending on our mood we

1849
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,239
might even scour back at them or flash

1850
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,640
them a smile and see how they respond to

1851
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,080
that

1852
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,520
and i think

1853
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,360
another scenario that really brings this

1854
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,120
intuition out very strongly is to think

1855
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,600
about the peculiar kind of tension that

1856
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,320
comes in a job interview

1857
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,719
so i think that tension is the result of

1858
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,360
a confluence of two things firstly very

1859
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,280
high uncertainty

1860
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,120
uncertainty that's really important to

1861
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,920
us and also the fact that our usual

1862
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,719
embodied epistemic resources have been

1863
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,159
straightjacketed by social convention

1864
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,520
because it's the case that in a job

1865
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,600
interview even though we want to know a

1866
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,360
lot about what the other people are

1867
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,960
thinking and feeling

1868
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,040
social convention dictates that we can't

1869
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,080
ask them

1870
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,719
we can't prod them and we can't really

1871
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,320
sample the scene in ways that are going

1872
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,159
to give us more information we're kind

1873
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,760
of stuck to the chair we just have to

1874
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,360
wait and see

1875
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,679
and that's an unusual situation to being

1876
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,480
because so much of uh human

1877
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,040
social and emotional interaction relies

1878
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,679
on active states to use active inference

1879
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,960
terms so

1880
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,960
speaking listening

1881
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,920
prodding smiling scowling raising an

1882
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,480
eyebrow all of these things are embodied

1883
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,679
actions

1884
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,159
that we take to learn more about social

1885
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,679
setting

1886
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,199
and i think the thing to emphasize is

1887
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,000
how important context is as well so the

1888
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,320
ability to kind of actively survey a

1889
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,719
scene to drink in context

1890
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,360
but also the way we learn about the

1891
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,840
relevance of that context is um

1892
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,159
something that's built up and scaffolded

1893
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,719
through action and uh different kind of

1894
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,719
patterns of practice

1895
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,400
so if you think about the scala on the

1896
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,239
bus again there's a

1897
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,080
high degree of uncertainty around that

1898
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,600
facial expression

1899
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,440
but if you imagine that same facial

1900
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,719
expression transported into

1901
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,320
the onto the face of somebody on the

1902
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,400
other side of a boxing ring

1903
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,719
all of a sudden the uncertainty around

1904
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,120
that facial expression is minimized

1905
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
because the context of

1906
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,280
boxing ring tells you everything you

1907
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,880
need to know about why that person is

1908
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,960
scowling at you

1909
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,640
and this emphasis on context is

1910
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,560
something that's badly missing

1911
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,120
um in current iterations

1912
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,120
and the active inference community is

1913
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,679
already producing really cool work

1914
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,000
premised on these kinds of insights

1915
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,679
so there's this paper thinking through

1916
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,520
other minds by samuel vasiere and

1917
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,320
colleagues and this paper highlights

1918
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,239
just how it is that we come to

1919
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,960
understand our socio-cultural niches

1920
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,880
through precisely this kind of active

1921
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
social foraging so it's really

1922
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,760
emphasizing the importance of context

1923
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,679
and the fact that we come to learn about

1924
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,199
context through action

1925
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,840
and there's an example

1926
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,640
um of where we see a gap between

1927
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,760
artificial systems and humans

1928
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,920
when dealing with context is how

1929
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,080
artificial systems and humans compare

1930
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,520
when

1931
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,159
performing selective attention to in

1932
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,840
regards to some tasks

1933
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
so it's a really pervasive problem in

1934
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,520
artificial systems that they don't tend

1935
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,120
to look at the same places that human

1936
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,800
beings do

1937
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,719
when human beings are surveying a scene

1938
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,239
for some kind of task

1939
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,880
relevant information so the question is

1940
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,400
how do we get

1941
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,040
artificial systems to drink in context

1942
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,360
in the same way that humans do and then

1943
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,159
how will that improve the performance of

1944
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,560
emotion recognition devices

1945
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,719
so selective attention is all about

1946
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,199
filling in epistemic gaps it's about

1947
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,320
filling in gaps in your knowledge with

1948
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,719
information from a scene that may or may

1949
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,920
not be task relevant

1950
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,960
and

1951
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,560
one of the reasons humans are so good at

1952
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,000
this is because obviously we have this

1953
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,159
huge knowledge base of

1954
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,960
uh what different contexts mean we live

1955
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,199
in the world we've always inhabited

1956
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,600
socio-cultural niches and so we have a

1957
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,280
lot of experience

1958
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,840
but as i said before it's important to

1959
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,600
emphasize that the way that we learn

1960
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,080
about context is about sampling

1961
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,239
different contexts it's about

1962
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,640
the fact that we have our entire lives

1963
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,440
been actors in the world not passive

1964
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,640
observers

1965
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,480
and i think this work by moser and

1966
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,159
colleagues that you can see on the slide

1967
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,000
here

1968
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
it's really interesting because it shows

1969
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,679
that active inference is capable of

1970
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,239
modeling selective attention

1971
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,840
in ways that give us much more

1972
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,800
human-like results so they used certain

1973
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,360
kinds of internal precision dynamics and

1974
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,360
they demonstrated that these precision

1975
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,679
dynamics can map accurately covertly um

1976
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,840
task relevant and task irrelevant

1977
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,360
features of a scene

1978
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,560
and then update precision estimates in

1979
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,960
in relation to that information which

1980
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,679
then drives overt actions which then

1981
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,920
serve to update the system's model so

1982
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,600
it's this very close relationship

1983
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,400
between

1984
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,440
covert attention and overt tension which

1985
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,960
i think is really interesting on this

1986
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,199
account

1987
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,120
and i think active inference is a really

1988
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,960
powerful framework for recognizing

1989
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,760
addressing context generally and for the

1990
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,520
importance of action in learning about

1991
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,760
context so the models that i just

1992
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,000
outlined they provide the tools for this

1993
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,239
very elegant top-down

1994
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,560
first principles approach to selective

1995
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,760
attention

1996
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,360
which is based on these internal

1997
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,719
precision weighting dynamics but also on

1998
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:13,280
uh embodied action perception cycles

1999
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,960
and of course one nice side of side

2000
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,679
effect is this side effect of this

2001
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,080
is that systems based on this would be

2002
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,920
able to autonomously

2003
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,560
select the data from a scene which is

2004
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,640
going to give them the most epistemic

2005
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,199
payback and this means that they can do

2006
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,520
away with the very very large data sets

2007
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,920
and long training times which ai

2008
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,760
ethicists have said are probably the

2009
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,760
root cause of a lot of the ethical

2010
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,360
concerns that i talked about earlier

2011
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,760
and so from a practical standpoint this

2012
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,280
means that we need to think about

2013
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,280
building affective computing devices

2014
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,120
which are not merely

2015
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,440
inner lumps of plastic we need to start

2016
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,000
thinking about approximating something

2017
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,400
much more like a fully embodied agent

2018
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,480
one consequence that's really

2019
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,960
fascinating about the kind of active

2020
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,120
social learning that scaffolding

2021
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,920
scaffolded through other minds um that i

2022
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,280
was talking about earlier with the

2023
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,520
thinking through other minds paper

2024
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,480
is that active inference agents can come

2025
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,360
to enjoy a degree of synchrony between

2026
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,920
their internal states

2027
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,040
so

2028
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,360
this paper by carl fristen and chris

2029
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,360
fifth a duet for one

2030
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,840
it utilized simulations of songbirds to

2031
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,880
show that quote generalized synchrony is

2032
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,960
an emergent property of coupling active

2033
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,360
inference systems that are attempting to

2034
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,120
predict one another

2035
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,120
so in rough terms what they demonstrate

2036
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,920
is that according to active inference

2037
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,000
meaningful communication between two

2038
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,040
agents

2039
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,760
requires that they are sufficiently able

2040
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,920
to model one another in a kind of

2041
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,560
infinite regress so what it is is me

2042
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,120
modeling you modeling me modeling you

2043
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,960
and that by doing this by making and

2044
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,120
testing these kinds of predictions we

2045
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,159
essentially ultimately converge on

2046
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,800
model model synchronization

2047
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,600
and this is a core part of the paper the

2048
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,000
original paper by daphne de mekas that

2049
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,640
she did with um fristen and parr

2050
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,640
which has already suggested that if we

2051
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,560
take active inference as a starting

2052
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,560
point for building affective computing

2053
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,920
devices

2054
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,560
then what we have is the prospect of an

2055
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,199
artificial system which can potentially

2056
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,480
sync internal states with the user and

2057
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,080
that's obviously going to hold an awful

2058
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,280
lot of promise

2059
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,840
for um certain applications of effective

2060
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,239
computing and i would say to anybody

2061
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,760
interested in the kinds of things i'm

2062
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,520
talking about now to go and start with

2063
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,360
this paper by daphne

2064
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,640
because i think it's a really

2065
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,080
interesting and wonderful starting point

2066
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,040
but

2067
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,120
one thing that we want to say is that

2068
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,880
for this sort of deep

2069
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,040
affective synchrony between artificial

2070
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,080
devices and users

2071
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,080
it means that the artifact itself will

2072
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,400
need to have some kind of interroceptive

2073
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,320
signals

2074
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,400
some kind of internal affective dynamics

2075
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,679
of its own

2076
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,520
and it needs to be able to act in ways

2077
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,679
that expresses those signals so so far

2078
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,199
i've been talking about

2079
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,440
acting in ways to express those signals

2080
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,040
and acting in ways to sample the

2081
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,600
environment

2082
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,840
but i want to say something now about

2083
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,080
the prospect of active inference devices

2084
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,320
which actually have their own

2085
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,199
internal affective dynamics because i

2086
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,400
think that the active inference

2087
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,920
framework has already shown the

2088
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,000
potential to provide this

2089
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,360
what i'm talking about here is some

2090
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,880
fairly recent developments in the

2091
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,520
framework called aerodynamics

2092
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,640
um and using aerodynamics we can start

2093
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,199
to understand how embodied affective

2094
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,480
states are an intrinsic part of

2095
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,600
the motivational drive for curiosity and

2096
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,719
epistemic foraging

2097
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,960
so one of the really elegant famous

2098
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,880
strengths of active inference is that it

2099
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,520
has the power to dissolve

2100
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,159
this opposition between explore and

2101
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,280
exploit

2102
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,800
and while there are there have been

2103
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,639
numerous strategies for building the

2104
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,960
motivation to explore into artificial

2105
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,120
systems active inference has the

2106
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,440
potential to put embodied activity and

2107
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,480
emotion

2108
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,800
right at the center of solving that

2109
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,560
problem and so this is obviously going

2110
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,880
to be relevant if we want to build

2111
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,360
emotional recognition devices that are

2112
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,000
intrinsically motivated to probe the

2113
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,760
internal states of their users

2114
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,239
so i think it's worth taking a second to

2115
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,480
refresh how active inference accounts

2116
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,599
for emotion and effect

2117
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,199
so

2118
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,440
the first attempts to understand

2119
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,000
um interoception and active inference

2120
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,120
were

2121
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,880
they beared a lot of resemblance to the

2122
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,400
way that we were thinking about

2123
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,360
perception under active inference

2124
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,840
um so it was about um

2125
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,520
predicting um signals

2126
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,679
hidden states in the world except that

2127
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,360
the signals that the brain was trying to

2128
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,520
predict were internal signals they were

2129
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,520
coming from inside their own body

2130
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,719
um so gastrointestinal

2131
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,760
respiratory circulatory signals

2132
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,840
and feelings like hunger thirst

2133
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,920
temperature pain these were seen as

2134
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,000
top-down predictions about the hidden

2135
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,639
causes that underlay those physiological

2136
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,120
changes

2137
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,280
but it was the case that researchers

2138
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,639
that were working in affective

2139
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,280
neuroscience so people like lisa feldman

2140
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,320
barrett uh neil seth and mika allen they

2141
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,840
were quick to add that these

2142
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,120
interoceptive predictions probably held

2143
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,920
a kind of special prioritized place

2144
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,159
in terms of the overall system because

2145
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,239
they were likely to ground other

2146
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,840
predictions predictions about the

2147
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,400
external world in terms of what really

2148
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,320
matters which fundamentally is

2149
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,040
maintaining the homeostatic states of

2150
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,360
one's own body

2151
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,080
but more recently than this affective

2152
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,719
states have been hypothesized to fill

2153
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,400
another role within the active inference

2154
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,159
framework

2155
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:08,840
which

2156
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,760
is essentially says that felt bodily

2157
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,159
states things like mood and other

2158
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:17,520
affective states valence bodily states

2159
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,360
they reflect a kind of second order

2160
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,440
information within the dynamics of the

2161
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,520
active inference system and that

2162
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,520
information is essentially tracking the

2163
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,679
rate at which surprise is being

2164
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,880
minimized relative to the expectations

2165
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,159
of the system

2166
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,480
so according to aerodynamics affective

2167
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,520
states

2168
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,080
are essentially uh just the subjective

2169
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,960
level feedback about how the system is

2170
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,440
doing at minimizing surprise at keeping

2171
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,920
itself within expected bounds

2172
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,320
relative to the expectations that we had

2173
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,080
going into that scenario

2174
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,159
the second order information doesn't

2175
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,639
just it's not superficial in the sense

2176
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,239
that it just reflects that kind of

2177
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,560
information but it actually plays an

2178
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,480
intrinsic role in modulating the

2179
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,280
internal precision dynamics over action

2180
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,199
policies

2181
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,120
so from a phenomenological perspective i

2182
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,679
think this makes really intuitive sense

2183
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,080
so when we're doing better than expected

2184
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,920
at a certain task we tend to gain

2185
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,480
confidence we might take more risks

2186
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,199
and when we enter a certain scenario or

2187
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,199
task with a particular action policy

2188
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,120
which doesn't work out the way that we

2189
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,560
expected it to

2190
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,880
we would be very quick to switch things

2191
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,360
up and try something else

2192
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,760
and in this sense aerodynamics can be

2193
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,600
said to keep agents

2194
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,239
flexibly attuned to the opportunities

2195
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,400
for success within their environment as

2196
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,400
they learn and develop new skills and

2197
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,239
abilities

2198
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,080
and the thing to notice is that agents

2199
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,400
that are outfitted with a sensitivity to

2200
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,600
aerodynamics and naturally curious

2201
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,639
because

2202
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,040
finding new um

2203
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,760
uh new surprise in the environment which

2204
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,520
can be successfully minimized it

2205
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,800
literally feels good to us um and the

2206
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
places where um

2207
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,679
we find surprise that we can minimize um

2208
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,880
in the greatest amount is at the edge of

2209
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,440
our skills and abilities and this is why

2210
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,520
we like to find scenarios that are kind

2211
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,120
of

2212
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,280
maximally challenging without being

2213
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,440
frustratingly challenging without being

2214
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,840
too hard so we like to occupy areas that

2215
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,239
are neither too well known nor too

2216
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,719
complex

2217
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,719
and aerodynamics also plays a role in

2218
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,560
helping us to direct and enhance

2219
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,840
learning so um surprise and its

2220
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,320
reduction rates signal the expectations

2221
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,080
about the learnability of particular

2222
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,800
situations so that helps to guide our

2223
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,120
attention and prioritize certain areas

2224
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,679
or certain tasks where we know we can

2225
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,000
find the most success

2226
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,880
and we've already seen this kind of

2227
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,239
optimal

2228
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,280
surprise minimization show up in robots

2229
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,120
in terms of curiosity

2230
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,000
so there's this work here by odoya and

2231
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,800
smith where their robots were trained to

2232
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,760
seek out optimal levels of complexity

2233
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,719
where the most learning can take place

2234
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,480
and specifically

2235
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,080
now there have been active inference

2236
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,760
approaches that have begun to use

2237
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,960
aerodynamics in real world robotics

2238
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,760
so this is really exciting and this is

2239
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,159
kind of real world proof of concept in

2240
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,000
the work of skelassi lara and syria

2241
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,159
and these researchers have actually

2242
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,199
built robotic systems that make use of

2243
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,400
this internal

2244
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,120
aerodynamics

2245
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,120
machinery

2246
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,199
so their work has shown that robots that

2247
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,040
are equipped with aerodynamics are

2248
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,040
actually better able to manage

2249
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,080
uncertainty um by fluidly selecting

2250
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,320
adaptive actions in an environment

2251
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,239
compared to more traditional and

2252
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:55,199
traditional approaches

2253
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,520
so artificial agents equipped with

2254
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,480
internal aerodynamics are better able to

2255
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,360
learn um and then autonomously select

2256
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,639
the proper

2257
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,880
surprise minimization strategies in any

2258
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
given situation

2259
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,639
and they do this by allowing their

2260
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,120
valence states that second order

2261
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,440
information about performance relative

2262
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,960
to expectation

2263
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,360
to weigh the selection of the most

2264
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,840
suitable behavior so in other words by

2265
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,760
allowing that second order information

2266
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,880
to have a direct impact on the internal

2267
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,159
precision dynamics over action

2268
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,560
and this work showed that this kind of

2269
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,880
internal aerodynamics also provided a

2270
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,600
way for artificial agents to navigate

2271
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,880
the temporal aspects of goal selection

2272
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,719
so basically what that means is these

2273
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,800
agents were very

2274
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,199
knowledgeable about how long they should

2275
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,920
persevere with a certain task and when

2276
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,080
they should give up which is obviously

2277
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,080
something that even human being human

2278
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,760
beings struggle with a lot of the time

2279
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,639
so

2280
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,120
thinking in terms of aerodynamics

2281
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,760
it shows us that affect is intrinsically

2282
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,440
linked to goal selection

2283
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,199
and we want to suggest that

2284
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,679
by introducing these aerodynamics into

2285
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,000
affective computing devices we would

2286
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,719
start to see devices that are

2287
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,320
not only motivated to kind of

2288
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,040
exhibit a kind of curiosity

2289
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,760
in implementing new policies for action

2290
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,400
but we'd actually start to see a real

2291
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,480
paradigm shift in the affective

2292
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,120
computing program to a much more

2293
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,000
biomimetic approach so instead of just

2294
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,560
having classification devices

2295
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,280
in lumps of plastic or in smartphones

2296
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,920
we'd start to see embodied devices that

2297
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,480
can actively engage with the world

2298
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,480
and that have their own internal

2299
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,280
affective dynamics based on

2300
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,840
what we think is going on in living

2301
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,360
systems so this is really exciting

2302
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,360
and this new wave of affective computing

2303
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:08,719
devices would not only um

2304
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:11,199
be able to perform much better but we

2305
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,639
think it might go some way to um

2306
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,480
addressing some of the ethical concerns

2307
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,639
that i was talking about earlier

2308
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,880
but the thing to be really clear with we

2309
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,639
don't want to a kind of disclaimer at

2310
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,320
this point is we are certainly not

2311
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,000
saying that an affective

2312
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
sorry an active inference approach to

2313
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,760
affective computing

2314
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,800
is a replacement for thinking about all

2315
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,719
of the kinds of social justice issues

2316
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,159
that come with the implementation of

2317
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,320
this technology we are just kind of

2318
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,639
speculatively saying that it's on first

2319
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,639
glance it certainly appears like some of

2320
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,400
the ethical concerns might be addressed

2321
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,239
by this new approach

2322
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,239
um but we think there are going to be a

2323
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,320
lot of benefits of this new approach so

2324
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,679
first

2325
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,199
if you think about the kind of model

2326
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,400
synchrony

2327
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,400
um that i was talking about earlier and

2328
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,159
think about that within the context of

2329
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,480
therapeutic intervention

2330
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,639
we think that when we get this degree of

2331
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,199
model synchrony um

2332
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,840
any any dysfunction in the user's

2333
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,760
internal dynamics is going to be

2334
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,639
mirrored in the internal dynamics of the

2335
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,600
artifact and so this is going to be make

2336
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,600
the device very well placed to make

2337
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,920
suggestions about potential

2338
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,080
interventions and this is essentially

2339
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,040
what cbt already attempts to do so this

2340
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,199
will be building on approaches that have

2341
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,960
already been proven to be

2342
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,440
effective

2343
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,320
and the next thing is to think about

2344
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,239
the fact that so far when we've been

2345
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,760
talking about action

2346
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,280
i've been talking essentially about

2347
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,480
epistemic foraging um but once you have

2348
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,040
the possibility of humans and artifacts

2349
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,480
establishing this kind of model

2350
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,800
synchrony and you have these artifacts

2351
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,560
that are properly embodied and able to

2352
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,960
act in the world it might be possible

2353
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,120
for the artifact to begin to install

2354
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,800
prior preferences

2355
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,760
uh about what states in the agent are

2356
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,440
actually preferable

2357
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,600
such that the artifacts may actually be

2358
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,760
able to steer

2359
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,080
with a degree of autonomy the emotional

2360
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,960
synchrony between it and its user to

2361
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,719
specific ends so when we have this uh we

2362
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,360
have these active inference theories um

2363
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,440
beginning to emerge of depression and

2364
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,400
anxiety

2365
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,400
and other kinds of disorders

2366
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,400
with that full understanding coupled

2367
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,840
with the kind of model synchrony i've

2368
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,080
been talking about we start to open up

2369
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,800
avenues for the device itself

2370
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,880
steering the user away from these kinds

2371
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,840
of dysfunctions

2372
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,600
now it might be the case that these

2373
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,840
active inference devices come with their

2374
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,239
own set of worries and ethical concerns

2375
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,560
i think it's very plausible that they do

2376
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,000
and it's something that we're going to

2377
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,679
be thinking about as we go forward in

2378
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,199
this research

2379
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,159
but i don't have time to explore it here

2380
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,400
but i think the last thing to say is

2381
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,960
most speculatively is that this active

2382
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,199
inference approach also sets the stage

2383
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,679
for beginning to address the well-known

2384
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,080
value alignment problem between humans

2385
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,199
and ai devices

2386
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,840
basically what we have here to our mind

2387
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,800
is

2388
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,440
a initial and very speculative building

2389
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,840
blocks of building artificial systems

2390
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,560
that have a degree of genuine empathy

2391
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,920
with their users

2392
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,400
so these devices would not merely be

2393
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,560
simulating empathy or passively

2394
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,880
categorizing human emotion they would

2395
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,800
generally have genuinely have their own

2396
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,520
internal dynamics that would synchronize

2397
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,520
and match with the internal dynamics of

2398
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,239
a user and this is going to be a bedrock

2399
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,080
for much more interesting and much more

2400
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,360
rewarding human ai collaboration into

2401
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,440
the future

2402
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,679
and that's the end uh i wish i could be

2403
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,000
there to answer questions um

2404
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,480
unfortunately i'm not uh i'm pretty sure

2405
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,000
mark miller's going to be there with you

2406
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,400
so maybe he'd be happy to answer some

2407
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,120
questions but i would also encourage you

2408
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,360
to get in contact with myself i'd be

2409
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,280
really happy to hear from anybody that's

2410
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,199
interested in this kind of stuff

2411
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:06,000
um you can see my email there be white

2412

a real pleasure to get to present this

2418
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,880
work

2419
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,440
thank you very much

2420
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,040
all right

2421
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,520
um should i start

2422
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,639
we're back

2423
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,239
and yes

2424
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,960
please this is the presentation of north

2425
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,440
sajd learning agent preferences thanks

2426
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,239
north for joining and take it away

2427
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:27,199
brilliant thank you um daniel um

2428
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,199
so just before we get started i just

2429
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,679
wanted to thank daniel and the active

2430
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,960
inference um conference i guess um for

2431
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,560
inviting me to give a talk on this

2432
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,600
project um i'm really excited about that

2433
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,639
um so just to introduce myself i'm noor

2434
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,440
i'm a current phd student at the welcome

2435
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,600
center for human neuroimaging

2436
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,600
with carl fristen um this is some work

2437
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,520
that we've been uh thinking about over

2438
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,480
the last

2439
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,239
uh year or so

2440
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,360
um

2441
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,520
feel free to i don't know how well so do

2442
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,000
we have questions that um sorry do we

2443
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,880
have questions throughout the

2444
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,280
presentation or are they at the end

2445
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,760
um but if there are any questions

2446
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,280
we'll be uh

2447
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,440
taking questions in the live chat and

2448
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,840
then the round table will be bringing

2449
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,760
them

2450
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,159
directly during your presentation

2451
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:19,280
okay um yeah no worries

2452
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,520
okay so the project is focused on

2453
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,560
learning agent preferences and it's from

2454
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,000
my perspective is super interesting

2455
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,119
because that

2456
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,960
sort of changes the dynamics of how you

2457
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,960
consider the problem setting and that's

2458
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,880
what i'm going to start off with

2459
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,960
but before i do that um

2460
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,880
i just wanted to highlight my wonderful

2461
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,960
co-authors that i'll be uh sort of

2462
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,600
presenting the work on behalf of uh so

2463
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,320
we've got panus alexey

2464
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,440
zaff lance and carl um and the project

2465
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,960
so the work i'm presenting is based on

2466
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,159
two different projects and i'll

2467
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,440
highlight the

2468
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,320
the different work as we go through

2469
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,520
um so my print okay so i'm trying to

2470
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,639
flip okay let's yeah so the the way the

2471
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,080
presentation's going to be structured is

2472
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,400
just i'm going to briefly motivate the

2473
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,560
the problem setting um and then describe

2474
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,159
the problem setting in a bit more

2475
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,960
technical details and then really drill

2476
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,880
down into exactly how we can learn these

2477
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,159
preferences

2478
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,159
that we can equip the agent with and

2479
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,960
then some experiments and

2480
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,440
remarks

2481
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,159
so what i wanted to highlight is that

2482
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,000
when we learn agent preferences there's

2483
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
usually a bi-directional association

2484
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,679
between the the agent and the

2485
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:30,800
environment

2486
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,880
and what i mean by that um is something

2487
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,639
that you can see in this graphic really

2488
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:37,520
clearly so you've got uh the main part

2489
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,239
that the agent would have taken um

2490
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,480
as it was um walking down this

2491
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,280
particular route uh when hiking

2492
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,800
but as

2493
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,639
perhaps many

2494
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,800
other people are joining along the agent

2495
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,360
ends up um walking along the shorter or

2496
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,719
maybe the more

2497
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,080
smaller part

2498
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,320
um so what this highlights is that

2499
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,840
agent preferences are essentially

2500
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,760
dictated by the environment that it's

2501
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,239
surrounded by right so

2502
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:05,920
depending on the constraints so for

2503
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:08,159
example other agents maybe an animal or

2504
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,320
something else happening on the road

2505
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,719
would mean that the agent um ends up

2506
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,960
taking the second part instead of the

2507
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,320
first one

2508
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,719
and as a consequence of that it changes

2509
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,400
the environment so as more and more

2510
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,040
agents do the same thing um the the

2511
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,119
shape or the construct of that part

2512
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,119
becomes more prominent and it becomes

2513
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:29,040
part of that environment and what i'm

2514
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,520
really interested in as part of my work

2515
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,280
is this sort of bi-directional

2516
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,960
association between how the agent

2517
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,199
changes the world and the world changes

2518
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:38,560
the agent's preferences because it

2519
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,000
constrains the

2520
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,159
the the actual state space that it

2521
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,920
exists in

2522
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,239
um but as part of this project and the

2523
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,080
work i'll be presenting we're purely

2524
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,880
focusing on how the agent's preferences

2525
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,880
or the how the agents uh i guess

2526
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,719
objectives are changed as a consequence

2527
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:57,679
of the environment constraints

2528
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:01,520
um but before i do that i really um

2529
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,960
i wanted to highlight what preferences

2530
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,800
actually are because a lot of the time

2531
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,800
um we're not really aligned

2532
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,400
on what that means um so i'll just

2533
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,480
briefly uh describe how we are

2534
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,639
considering preferences so preferences

2535
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,440
here are usually a subjective assessment

2536
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,520
of what agents would like to experience

2537
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,280
and this can be continuously learned or

2538
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,000
modified even in the absence of external

2539
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,080
feedback so there might be some internal

2540
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:27,360
motivations or some um objectives that

2541
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,520
the agent is learning internally

2542
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,600
that shape exactly how the agent wants

2543
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,000
to behave in the world so in the

2544
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,560
previous example when we were looking at

2545
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,239
the case of

2546
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,400
going between the two parts depending on

2547
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,239
the constraint of the environment it's

2548
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,480
essentially the agent's subjective

2549
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,320
preference because it could have taken

2550
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,239
another route which uh so for example

2551
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,119
maybe

2552
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,600
here um and that could have also shaped

2553
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,520
the environment as well um

2554
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:56,960
okay

2555
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,639
um so let's motivate this problem

2556
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:01,199
setting slightly more formally

2557
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,679
um so we're going to be working um

2558
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:06,000
as part of um

2559
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,679
and the idea that these agents that

2560
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,280
we're interested in have an internal

2561
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,239
model

2562
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:13,199
and this internal model is um

2563
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,239
composed um really briefly of uh three

2564
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,159
important components um so three

2565
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,840
important random variables and then one

2566
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,520
deterministic variable so let me just

2567
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,600
qualify that a little bit more so we've

2568
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,800
got our

2569
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,199
outcomes so this is something that the

2570
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:28,719
agent is

2571
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:31,280
exposed to in the environment

2572
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,239
and

2573
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:37,040
for example um the the actual i guess um

2574
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,520
constraint in the instance of the the

2575
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,520
hiker being having to choose between the

2576
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,400
two parts for example um it might see a

2577
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,199
hindrance or it might um

2578
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:50,000
like have some grass or um some

2579
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
some other agents that are exposed to

2580
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,159
and it needs to that's the data coming

2581
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,560
through and it needs to then identify

2582
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,960
whether it wants to choose uh one part

2583
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,639
or the other part

2584
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,840
um

2585
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,320
so that would be based on the its own

2586
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
inferences about what that outcome

2587
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,880
actually means and so that's denoted by

2588
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,239
s here

2589
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,639
and then based on that it needs to then

2590
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,880
decide what action to take um and that's

2591
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,679
denoted by the a here

2592
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:18,639
um

2593
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,320
and at the same time the agent is

2594
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,840
keeping track in this particular

2595
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,159
formulation of the the agent's model or

2596
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,679
the general model that we're interested

2597
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:26,480
in

2598
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,400
which is denoted by this deterministic

2599
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,880
variable h2

2600
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,760
or h3 depending on which

2601
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,320
time point we're interested in that is

2602
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,639
essentially this deterministic recurrent

2603
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,040
model that we have um that's encoding

2604
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,239
all the prior history um the the actual

2605
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,400
states uh sorry the actions and the

2606
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,080
states that the agent has been exposed

2607
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,679
to sorry

2608
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:50,960
in the past

2609
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,239
and that encodes what is the

2610
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,639
the updates that are then used to select

2611
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:59,360
the the posterior estimates uh for the

2612
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,440
the next time point

2613
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,440
um then you've got your

2614
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,760
in this particular model you've got your

2615
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,560
latent state and prior and and we're

2616
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,280
just

2617
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,440
calculating them in really a specific

2618
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,679
way so your prior is defined as

2619
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,440
categorical distribution and this

2620
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,360
becomes really important for us because

2621
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,080
this allows us to use some conjugacy

2622
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,719
rules to update the way the agent's

2623
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:24,800
preferences are land and i'll come back

2624
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,960
to what i mean by preferences in this

2625
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,040
technical setting a little bit more

2626
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,280
on the next slide

2627
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,560
and the state posterior here is again a

2628
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,480
categorical distribution that the agent

2629
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:39,280
is estimating based on the history and

2630
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,800
the current observation it's been

2631
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,199
exposed to

2632
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,360
then we've got the standard formulation

2633
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,360
if you're working within a mdp

2634
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,119
formulation where we've got a transition

2635
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,520
function so this is denoted again as a

2636
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,600
categorical distribution conditioned on

2637
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,840
the history of the agent that's what the

2638
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,159
agent is encoding and then we've got an

2639
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:01,360
image predictor um that determines

2640
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,880
exactly what would be the next um time

2641
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,480
point oh sorry what would be the next

2642
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,000
observation given the history and the

2643
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,440
state

2644
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,920
um so the idea with this gender model is

2645
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,080
that you have an encoding of how the

2646
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,719
agent is representing the world it tells

2647
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,320
you exactly how this

2648
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,360
outcomes

2649
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,440
are then um

2650
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,159
inferred as particular states that then

2651
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,639
allows the agent to evaluate particular

2652
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,840
actions but i haven't really um defined

2653
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,400
how the actions are selected um so we

2654
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,199
work in a standard uh active inference

2655
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,440
setting where the

2656
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,480
actions

2657
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,880
are defined as um

2658
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,800
being sampled from some probability

2659
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,719
distribution a so the actions we saw

2660
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:49,679
before which is calculated as the arg

2661
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,360
max of minus g over a so what is that

2662
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,800
exactly

2663
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,880
um so for our work um we were interested

2664
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,199
in essentially extending the minus the

2665
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,679
expected free energy um with a conjugate

2666
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,400
prior and so the expected free energy in

2667
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,400
standard terms would be something where

2668
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,400
you have an extrinsic

2669
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,880
imperative you have a salience

2670
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,040
formulation and you have novelties

2671
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,520
extrinsic imperative is something that's

2672
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,400
contained by the environment saliency is

2673
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,719
when you want to have accurate belief

2674
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,719
updates and novelty is when you want to

2675
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:25,840
be able to estimate your world

2676
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,480
appropriately given the the parameters

2677
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,000
of the model that you've been able to

2678
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,320
learn um

2679
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,280
and

2680
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,040
when we extend it for the preference

2681
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,800
learning setting um and this is

2682
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,560
something other folks have done

2683
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,600
um maybe introducing it as part of uh

2684
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,400
prior over the outcome space um so we're

2685
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,320
looking at as part of a prior over the

2686
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,920
state space so

2687
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,800
um

2688
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,880
sorry um

2689
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,040
let's see if i can get the color to

2690
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,000
change okay so this is the

2691
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,800
the prior and we're conditioning it on a

2692
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,800
categorical distribution d which i

2693
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,199
highlighted before and that allows us to

2694
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,440
take him to um i guess

2695
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,800
i'm sorry

2696
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,440
use uh some of the conjugation rules of

2697
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,919
interest

2698
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:16,800
so now i'm gonna um

2699
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,360
go to the next bit so um sorry just

2700
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,960
going back here so

2701
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,440
um what do we have so far um before we

2702
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,280
move on to how do we actually land this

2703
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,360
um d that we were interested in the

2704
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,639
previous slide

2705
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,880
so we have an agent who's equipped to

2706
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:31,840
the model

2707
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,400
the agent is interacting with the world

2708
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,800
and based on this interaction the way

2709
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,199
the agent is learning its preferences

2710
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:40,719
can shift

2711
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,600
and the way is shifted is a consequence

2712
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,920
of the type of actions it's making that

2713
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,840
we had using the expected free energy

2714
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,679
so how do we learn um preferences um

2715
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,679
so in the literature there's been um

2716
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,040
well at least in the psychology

2717
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,280
literature and some of the

2718
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,080
the spiking neural networks and other

2719
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,159
formulations um there's been a few

2720
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,480
different ways it's been proposed how

2721
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,719
agents are learning preferences

2722
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,639
um so one of them is mere exposure

2723
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,800
effects so the idea that when you're

2724
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,600
seeing something quite frequently

2725
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,639
that that pairing is more absurd sorry

2726
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:21,119
more preferred than if you want um

2727
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,360
seeing that

2728
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,760
and this can be uh categorized as a

2729
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,960
heavy plasticity learning rule

2730
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,800
then you've got attention mechanisms

2731
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,480
where when you're attending to an option

2732
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,280
um it becomes more preferable so maybe

2733
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,639
you're selectively looking at x or y

2734
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,960
and based on that you've filtered out

2735
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,400
all the other data that you've been

2736
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,440
exposed to um and that's what becomes

2737
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,360
more uh something that you as an agent

2738
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,719
would prefer

2739
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:49,679
um

2740
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:52,000
and if you were to think about a more i

2741
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,639
guess um biological construct of that

2742
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:56,639
that might be a consequence of some

2743
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,119
synaptic gaiting that can encourage the

2744
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,520
enhancement or some sort of suppression

2745
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,840
of the data or the noise that you are

2746
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,320
exposed to

2747
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,000
another formulation could be the

2748
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,920
contextual effects where

2749
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,600
an option is only preferred when it's

2750
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,119
compared to some other options so

2751
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,880
there's this relative

2752
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,080
comparison happening and based on um

2753
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,480
that in particular in certain settings

2754
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,199
you would want to do x instead of y and

2755
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:26,639
here x could be taking the path uh the

2756
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,679
longer route sorry the wider route route

2757
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,440
in comparison to the

2758
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,920
maybe the the tinier route that we saw

2759
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,480
in the hiker picture and that could be

2760
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,880
on you you only prefer the wider route

2761
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,480
when you don't see an animal some

2762
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:43,280
blockage there

2763
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,280
and this encodes some behavior relevant

2764
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,400
signal selection for the agent

2765
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,480
um so now what i'm going to do is i'm

2766
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,159
going to go through

2767
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:54,400
some rules um and some formulations that

2768
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,920
we've been thinking about in terms of

2769
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,080
encoding preferences

2770
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,679
and they

2771
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,600
are um

2772
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,800
the way we've um sort of privatized the

2773
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,639
the learning of those preferences it's

2774
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:07,600
it

2775
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,239
is aligned with some of the um i guess

2776
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,159
things people in psychology have also

2777
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,000
been thinking about

2778
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,560
so the first one is learning preferences

2779
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,480
from your exposure

2780
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,320
so we start off with extending the

2781
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,000
agent's gender model with a conjugate

2782
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,320
prior over the prior beliefs and what

2783
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,400
that simply means is that we take the

2784
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,560
categorical distribution

2785
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,000
that we've

2786
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,159
conditioned our prior state on

2787
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:37,600
and then we introduce a prior over that

2788
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,239
um and that allows us to take into

2789
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:42,800
account some of the the conjugacy up to

2790
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,040
update rules that we're interested in

2791
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,880
um because our

2792
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,920
categorical distribution is oh sorry our

2793
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,880
prior distribution over the state space

2794
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,400
is d

2795
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,199
um

2796
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,880
which is a categorical distribution we

2797
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,000
can now define a directional

2798
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,280
distribution as a conjugate prior

2799
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,600
which is denoted here

2800
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,600
and we've just got two different

2801
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,159
formulations here of how you can update

2802
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,360
that

2803
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,719
so essentially

2804
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:14,960
as you're exposed to more data you are

2805
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,280
introducing um you're counting your suit

2806
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,520
accounts over the summation of all the

2807
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,639
suit accounts in that particular um

2808
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:26,000
factor that you you're interested in

2809
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:26,880
so

2810
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,119
taking this into account we can do have

2811
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:30,639
been learning um

2812
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,880
rule which we do using online

2813
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,639
interactions through preference

2814
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,199
preferences so the way it works is that

2815
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,440
given your

2816
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,239
hyper prize in the time point before you

2817
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:46,080
can update those based on um

2818
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,320
some alpha sorry some learning rule

2819
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,600
alpha and also the belief um

2820
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,600
updates you've had in the past so this

2821
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,480
is denoted by the s for that particular

2822
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,360
um

2823
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,920
pseudo counts or the territory um

2824
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,639
primatizations uh for this current time

2825
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:05,520
point and you add all of this together

2826
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,440
and that gives you the updated

2827
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,880
preferences

2828
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,719
um so the way this particular

2829
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:12,480
formulation works is that the more you

2830
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,440
see something the more you're going to

2831
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,840
prefer it because

2832
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,920
there's a very simple

2833
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,159
learning happening here

2834
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,880
and in the simulations and the way we

2835
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,040
formulated at the moment

2836
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,199
we've got alpha set as a static

2837
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:31,280
parameter equal to one so you can

2838
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,080
manipulate that and the way you uh you

2839
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,400
can manipulate it where if you

2840
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,639
have it alpha going to

2841
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,280
uh greater than one um

2842
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:44,159
you will then wait the new data coming

2843
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,320
in a lot more in comparison to if you

2844
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,239
had it out for less than

2845
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,960
one um then you're not taking into

2846
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,520
account the the weight of the new data

2847
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,400
coming in as much

2848
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,599
and what this allows us to have is

2849
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:02,239
accumulation of particular contingencies

2850
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:05,840
or the way we are privatizing our prior

2851
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,639
and these dictate the land preferences

2852
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,360
um

2853
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,199
okay

2854
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,119
the next formulation of learning

2855
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:17,679
preferences i wanted to speak about was

2856
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,360
how we can learn by attending to

2857
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,119
preferred options

2858
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,119
so here we're going to slightly change

2859
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,280
the model um

2860
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,280
by introducing us

2861
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,960
an additional preference learning

2862
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,440
component so we again are extending the

2863
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,280
agency enter model with conjugate price

2864
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,239
over the

2865
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:36,080
prior release so the hyper price so this

2866
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,880
is exactly the same as before but the

2867
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,080
the

2868
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,400
the different thing that we're adding

2869
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,280
here

2870
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,280
is the synaptic gate scene code

2871
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,960
preferences and these just are

2872
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,560
computational homologs that we've

2873
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,080
introduced um

2874
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,199
and

2875
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,119
in terms of the actual

2876
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:54,480
uh

2877
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,719
biology of like the the formulation i

2878
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:58,960
think that's open to interpretation but

2879
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,280
these allow us to have an attentive

2880
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,960
mechanism which is what we're interested

2881
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:03,760
in

2882
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,960
and we do this to a two-step procedure

2883
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,000
so first we encode memories and how that

2884
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,599
how that works is we

2885
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:13,520
take a sample of all the data that the

2886
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,880
agent is

2887
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,159
interested in

2888
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:21,360
um sorry the the agent has actually um

2889
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,639
um

2890
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:25,440
okay sorry um so the way the way the

2891
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,679
encoding of preferences is working is we

2892
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:30,719
have two components um which we're then

2893
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:33,040
um combining together the first

2894
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,280
component is the the online exchange

2895
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,520
that the agent has had so by online

2896
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,719
exchange i mean

2897
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:42,239
um the agent is selecting its um actions

2898
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,880
based on the expected free energy and

2899
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,199
that's allowing you to

2900
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:48,960
essentially gather data about all the

2901
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,239
different trajectories it follows

2902
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:52,719
depending on what action is taken and

2903
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,639
it's got the data and its posterior

2904
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,400
estimates given that

2905
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,040
the next um so this would be the the on

2906
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,040
policy

2907
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,520
um

2908
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,599
the second bit that we have is the

2909
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,560
imagined interactions so this is when

2910
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,599
the agent is offline in the sense that

2911
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,239
it's no longer being exposed or given

2912
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:17,679
outcome with outcomes uh based on its

2913
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,080
imagined or the way it's interacting

2914
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,280
with the world

2915
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,840
and the only thing it's getting is the

2916
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,599
the updates in the states

2917
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:27,760
uh the latent states depending on what

2918
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,520
actions it's selecting and this is the

2919
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:32,719
imagination part

2920
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,840
um

2921
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,320
so what we're doing is we're combining

2922
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,840
this together

2923
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,760
and we take 30

2924
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,960
of this

2925
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:47,119
and all of this um so these are 10 steps

2926
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,560
into the future

2927
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,320
um and then we're essentially

2928
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,239
interleaving them together and that

2929
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:55,199
gives us an encoding of the memory

2930
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:58,639
um the reason for only using 30 is to

2931
01:52:58,639 --> 01:52:59,920
allow for

2932
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,560
um the imagined interaction of the new

2933
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,159
percep things that the agent is

2934
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:06,639
considering to be taken into account

2935
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:07,920
and

2936
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,159
and the the idea with the interleaving

2937
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,639
is that we're allowing for but the the

2938
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,320
real experience and the imagine

2939
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,159
experience so the the reel is here the

2940
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:19,440
on policy experience to be um used to

2941
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,719
shape the way the agent is um

2942
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:25,199
encoding its perception of what has

2943
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:27,360
happened in the past

2944
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,800
um and then using the encoded memories

2945
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,760
we then encode the preferences using um

2946
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,320
a selective attention process so this

2947
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,719
memory buffer that we have here

2948
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:41,360
is what i showed in the previous slide

2949
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,599
so this is the memory buffer

2950
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:46,880
um and then using this we essentially um

2951
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,520
encode the preferences using two gating

2952
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,119
mechanisms so the first one is an

2953
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:53,679
attention block and the second one is a

2954
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,280
gating block

2955
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,000
the attention block um

2956
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,960
essentially weights some part of our

2957
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,679
distribution slightly higher and then

2958
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,280
the gating block

2959
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,000
constrains or restricts that data out by

2960
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,840
filtering it

2961
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,159
and we are optimizing these

2962
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,679
two

2963
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,320
blocks using maxim entropy and the idea

2964
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,040
with

2965
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,280
optimizing through maximum entropy is to

2966
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,520
allow for

2967
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,159
some shifts in what's happening

2968
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:25,840
um

2969
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,760
and by shifts i mean to have a more

2970
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,520
flexible representation because we're

2971
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,760
trying to maximize the entropy of the

2972
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,760
distribution

2973
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,760
okay and this formulation allows us to

2974
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,760
encode filter contingencies that can

2975
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,760
dictate land preferences this is a

2976
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,440
slightly different formulation built on

2977
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,920
the same bayesian updates but we're

2978
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,000
introducing this uh selected memory

2979
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,360
component

2980
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,199
um okay so i'm going to quickly go

2981
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:51,280
through the experiments

2982
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,159
um so we evaluated this um the two

2983
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:58,000
algorithms in a 16 by 16 by 10 grid

2984
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,360
world um so an example grid is here so

2985
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,199
the agent is presented with this image

2986
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:05,119
including its own location at each time

2987
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:07,360
step and we've got four distinct states

2988
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,639
so we've got red we've got blue we've

2989
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,040
got the light green and the dark green

2990
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,320
as well

2991
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,480
and in this particular formulation

2992
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,639
we have no reward or score outcome

2993
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:21,119
modality so the agent is learning purely

2994
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:23,199
on um

2995
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:26,159
its um motivation to understand the

2996
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,840
world and if there are questions about

2997
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,159
that we can talk about it

2998
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:32,880
um and the grid is change every k steps

2999
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,040
and and the k determines how volatile

3000
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:38,080
the environment is and at each uh

3001
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,560
episode the agent is initialized in some

3002
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,960
random applications so maybe here or

3003
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,840
here

3004
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,679
and that constrains how it interacts

3005
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:47,199
with the world

3006
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:51,040
um so for sake of time i might skip this

3007
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,119
this bit um but

3008
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,119
essentially uh the tables are

3009
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,960
highlighting exactly what the training

3010
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,800
parameters were and they were fairly

3011
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,599
consistent um actually exactly the same

3012
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:04,000
between the two algorithms so the pepper

3013
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,520
formulation where we have had been

3014
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,679
plasticity and the north formulation

3015
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,280
we're doing um

3016
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,679
non-reinforced um updates using

3017
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,440
selective attention

3018
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,199
and then the preference uh learning

3019
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:17,679
parameters um that like how long the

3020
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:20,159
planning horizon was um so it was 15 and

3021
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:23,280
we have an episode length of 100 and we

3022
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,400
do this for 50 episodes and we reset so

3023
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,199
k

3024
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,400
so k

3025
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:32,719
is reset every 1 25 50 75 and 100 steps

3026
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:34,719
and this gives us a nice way of

3027
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:36,719
evaluating what's happening

3028
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:37,920
um

3029
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:38,880
so then the first thing we were

3030
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,480
interested in was evaluating how the

3031
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,320
preferences are shifting in a static

3032
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,440
setting

3033
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,000
um so this is one where we have hebbian

3034
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,360
so this is

3035
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,400
learning

3036
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,719
um and this is where we have the

3037
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:52,719
attentive um

3038
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:55,280
gating measure here and with the heavy

3039
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:58,239
and we can see the um so this is the on

3040
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:01,360
the x-axis we have the states dimensions

3041
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,000
and the y-axis we have the epochs or the

3042
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,960
time consideration and this is the same

3043
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,280
for both uh the figures that we've seen

3044
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,719
at the moment

3045
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,880
and we can see with the hebian one that

3046
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,639
um

3047
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,360
as we go further down it becomes more

3048
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,679
concentrated and there's no really shift

3049
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:22,320
here whereas for this um for the the

3050
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,800
attentive uh preference planning um

3051
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,360
measure we've got these random blocks

3052
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,840
that appear that once they're before uh

3053
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,920
but they also disappear so it's quite

3054
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,440
interesting that over time the

3055
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,920
preferences are shifting as a different

3056
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,760
measure compared if you're doing a

3057
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:39,760
qualitative assessment of the comparison

3058
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,400
between the two

3059
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,960
um and then the content and our post

3060
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,840
talk uh analysis of trying to actually

3061
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,679
understand what is happening

3062
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,880
quantitatively we compared the heavy

3063
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:56,080
learning formulation with the attentive

3064
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,480
selective attention preference uh

3065
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,639
formulation and then we compared it with

3066
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:02,639
the baseline which is the expected free

3067
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:03,920
energy of g

3068
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,280
here

3069
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,599
and on the y-axis we have the

3070
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:09,760
environment volatility again this is the

3071
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:13,760
k percent k but just denoted as percent

3072
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,760
and then we on the y-axis we have

3073
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,080
preference satisfaction and exploration

3074
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:20,320
trade-off that we're using as orthodox

3075
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,880
distance and this is just evaluating how

3076
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,719
far particular trajectories have shifted

3077
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:29,360
so what we're comparing um is

3078
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,440
whether there's an increase exploration

3079
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,599
or not depending on which preference

3080
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:36,080
metric we're using because based on our

3081
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,760
qualitative assessment that we saw

3082
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,400
before there is this shift um between

3083
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,719
the different uh encoding of preferences

3084
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:43,840
given the

3085
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:46,159
the the preference measurement sorry

3086
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,480
formulation that you're using

3087
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,360
so we can see that when we get to 50

3088
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,719
volatility there is this shift from

3089
01:58:53,719 --> 01:58:56,960
exploitation to exploration um

3090
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,760
for

3091
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,480
the pepper algorithm and so we see that

3092
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,840
here

3093
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,520
based on this

3094
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,520
nice

3095
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,880
mode of the distribution that we're

3096
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,639
seeing here whereas for the the new uh

3097
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:13,840
formulation is slightly um

3098
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,000
expanded out but it's not as

3099
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,320
exploitative as the

3100
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,000
pepper formulation

3101
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:20,800
um

3102
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,119
and then when we are looking at extreme

3103
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:25,119
ends we can also see that there is this

3104
01:59:25,119 --> 01:59:27,760
shift from exploration exploration to

3105
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,199
exploitation

3106
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:32,320
um for

3107
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,960
the pepper formulation but we don't

3108
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,800
necessarily see it for the more

3109
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,520
formulation so at the moment

3110
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,599
there is some quantitative differences

3111
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:44,480
in the way the two agents are evaluating

3112
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,440
um

3113
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,360
encoding preferences and how that shapes

3114
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,920
the behavior

3115
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:52,080
and this is just an example of the north

3116
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,679
formulation in terms of how much it's

3117
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,360
exploring the path

3118
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,520
and the the way it's interacted with the

3119
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,480
environment

3120
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,320
so these are the grid worlds and this is

3121
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,800
just a heat map of that

3122
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,199
exploration trajectory

3123
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:06,639
um then i'm just going to quickly do

3124
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,000
some takeaways

3125
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,080
um so both of the formulations that we

3126
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,440
have even though

3127
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,520
quantitatively and qualitatively they

3128
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,760
are providing different ways of encoding

3129
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,159
preferences they do have a tendency to

3130
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:19,679
influence the agent behavior that's

3131
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,360
different to the baseline or the

3132
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,199
expected free energy where you didn't

3133
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:26,080
allow for this change uh preference

3134
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,360
assessment

3135
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,599
and um if we are to compare with the

3136
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:31,760
standard reinforcement learning setting

3137
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,000
we are here casting what is preferred to

3138
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,840
an agent instead of the environment or

3139
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,679
the designer and it's particularly

3140
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:40,480
important in a robotic setting where you

3141
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,239
want to be able to

3142
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:46,800
go back and allow the agent or a robot

3143
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,040
to be able to shape some of its own

3144
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,280
goals and objectives

3145
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:52,880
purely if it's working in a more

3146
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:55,360
creative setting maybe in

3147
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,360
one in settings where it has to do a

3148
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,199
really specific task this type of

3149
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:01,920
formulation might not be the best

3150
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,159
um but this does provide a flexible

3151
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,080
formulation um where we're only

3152
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,679
modifying the

3153
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:09,679
the preference learning component and

3154
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,560
using the same gender model so the the

3155
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,199
initial general model that i defined for

3156
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:16,960
the agent is kept consistent for both

3157
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,920
the pepper and the normal formulation

3158
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,000
but the behavior that we're getting is

3159
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,920
through this additional component that

3160
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,199
we add

3161
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:26,960
um

3162
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,280
but the the key thing to note is that

3163
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,920
these preferences are a consequence of

3164
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,000
learning suitable um learning a suitable

3165
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,239
gender model so if your gender model

3166
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:38,080
isn't that good then the way you would

3167
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,920
learn the preferences themselves might

3168
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:42,159
not be the best so there's a slight

3169
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:44,800
trade-off um because whoever's designing

3170
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,800
this formulation or working with this

3171
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,639
foundation needs to take into account

3172
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:50,719
how well the the gender model has been

3173
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:54,159
encoded or launched by the gen agent

3174
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:56,480
um and on that particular note i'm just

3175
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,599
going to end the presentation um so

3176
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:01,840
thank you so much everyone for listening

3177

this great work and my funders and i've

3179
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:10,880
got the the qr codes for both the the

3180
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:14,480
papers if you're interested

3181

you can

3187
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:29,520
depart the room and you can rejoin for

3188
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,199
the round table if you'd like otherwise

3189
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:33,199
thanks again for joining

3190
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:34,800
thank you so much have a good day bye

3191
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,920
bye see you bye

3192
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,599
awesome

3193
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:42,159
all right the next talk is going to be

3194
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,400
by wen hua chen

3195
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,719
do a control for exploitation and

3196
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,119
exploration and its applications in

3197
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,119
robotic autonomous search

3198
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:55,400
just one second

3199
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,599
hi there yo

3200
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:11,080
hi

3201
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,159
one

3202
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:17,040
all right we're back we're back with

3203
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,560
with wen huachen

3204
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,480
thanks again for joining and please take

3205
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,879
it away

3206
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:25,840
okay thanks for uh you want me to this

3207
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,800
uh

3208
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,560
particular meeting uh it's quite

3209
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,000
interesting for me

3210
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,760
and as we are not

3211
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:35,199
i'm not always operating this particular

3212
02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:38,320
community so thanks for providing me

3213
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:40,639
this uh chance to share my working

3214
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,079
experience with you

3215
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:45,760
so my talk is about how to uh develop a

3216
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:48,000
autonomous search strategy for uh

3217
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,280
robotics

3218
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,840
and investing at a context about a

3219
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,000
chemical biological and other

3220
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,199
interesting

3221
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:56,880
dispersion

3222
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,520
so the approach i'm there is called due

3223
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,280
control for exploration exploitation

3224
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:06,320
and as you will see is actually a lot of

3225
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,079
similarity with

3226
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:10,719
the active influence

3227
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:12,159
theory

3228
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:13,840
so i came from uh loughborough

3229
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,159
university i'm working

3230
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:18,719
in the airspace and automotive and union

3231
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:20,800
department so i have quite a strong

3232
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,000
engineering

3233
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,760
and background but not on the

3234
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:26,400
neuroscience

3235
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,199
so this is the best outline of my talk

3236
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:31,040
and you can i can show you some

3237
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,679
background about the application and

3238
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:34,400
also

3239
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,000
discuss

3240
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,639
design method and then talk about the

3241
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:42,079
simulation and experiment results

3242
02:05:42,079 --> 02:05:44,159
and also particularly i'm interested to

3243
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:47,520
share with you about my thinking about

3244
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,000
what are the relationship between the

3245
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,119
the approach we discussed here and also

3246
02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:55,040
the active influence reinforcement

3247
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,440
learning and other similar kind of area

3248
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,599
and then talk about what is the way move

3249
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:01,679
forward

3250
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:04,239
so and let's talk about the autonomous

3251
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:06,639
search as the case study

3252
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:08,639
so this is a

3253
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:10,320
so basically they can why they found it

3254
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:13,599
in the natural environment and for the

3255
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,520
the polar bear if they try to find the

3256
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:16,960
prey or the food

3257
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,440
and they need to use a small audience

3258
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,920
and also similarly you can find insects

3259
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,400
if they are such mating and other food

3260
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,560
they can use similar kind of strategy

3261
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,119
the idea here is and by

3262
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:31,599
making use of the sensors they are near

3263
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:34,880
to reasoning about where the food or the

3264
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:37,599
soil might be then think about it what

3265
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:41,040
is the best strategy in order to find it

3266
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,040
and particularly interesting for us is

3267
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:45,440
how to convert this um

3268
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,679
in kind of intelligence from natural

3269
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,880
world into the engineering area so we

3270
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,560
are able to teach robots or uavs try to

3271
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,199
search and be chemical marriage and

3272
02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:00,239
resources and also and in the future you

3273
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:01,679
can be using for

3274
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:04,560
environmental uh force uh

3275
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,040
enforcement for example and try to fund

3276
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,920
the protein aware resources and many

3277
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,800
many other applications so basically you

3278
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,199
can think about it the idea here is

3279
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:18,159
somehow like you try to develop

3280
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:20,880
a small dog which can slip around them

3281
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,440
try to find the drugs and other

3282
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:27,320
endangered materials

3283
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:29,599
this is not a new area there are lots of

3284
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:31,199
research in the area and particularly

3285
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:34,239
bio inspired a lot of research

3286
02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:36,480
people can be using and the campbell

3287
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:38,560
texas or and

3288
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:39,679
the other

3289
02:07:39,679 --> 02:07:42,400
reactive strategy like you fly down the

3290
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,400
wing if you found something you try to

3291
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:47,520
follow the trace in order to search the

3292
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,960
resources

3293
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:51,440
another mainstream uh

3294
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:54,000
working this area is based on we call

3295
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,880
the information theory approach which is

3296
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:59,280
uh you treat this kind of process

3297
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:02,320
as a information game process

3298
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,560
somehow at the beginning you don't know

3299
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,800
where are the sources and you have high

3300
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,719
level of anxiety then during your search

3301
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:13,199
you drive the level also in the lower

3302
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:15,599
and lower so this is actually is that

3303
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:19,440
you can think about it this is a

3304
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,599
information game and then you can using

3305
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:24,320
the reward function like entropy like

3306
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,920
the uh

3307
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,040
k or divergence of many others to

3308
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:30,239
measure

3309
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:32,719
the success of your search and then

3310
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:34,960
based on that you can derive the

3311
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:37,840
strategy to driving to do this but now

3312
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:40,719
we're not we're looking to another angle

3313
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:43,360
and we treated it as a control problem

3314
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,159
and then think about how to

3315
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:49,520
link this with a active interference

3316
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:51,760
the same kind of work

3317
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,440
so when we

3318
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:57,440
try to search the uh

3319
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:58,960
a source and you don't need any

3320
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,440
information so basically on the robot

3321
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,239
you have a chemical or biology agent gas

3322
02:09:04,239 --> 02:09:05,840
sensors

3323
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,159
and then based on that every time you

3324
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:10,320
need to reason where you need to move

3325
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:11,599
your robot

3326
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:15,040
in order to have best chance to find

3327
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:17,119
the source so there is a strong

3328
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:19,280
interaction between the robot and the

3329
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,840
environment and the environment rover

3330
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:23,679
and also they have a strong impact

3331
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:25,520
coupling between the

3332
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:26,960
the perception

3333
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:29,760
and uh and any decision making so

3334
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,159
basically if you decide to go to

3335
02:09:32,159 --> 02:09:34,079
different location and then you will

3336
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:36,400
take a different kind of chemical sensor

3337
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,480
maybe this will

3338
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:41,199
affect your belief about where the

3339
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:42,880
source might be

3340
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:45,599
and this will also change your cause of

3341
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,440
action because based on that you need to

3342
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:49,440
decide where you want to move in the

3343
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,840
next step so there is a strong covering

3344
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,520
between the perception

3345
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,639
and

3346
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,000
the planning or action

3347
02:09:58,079 --> 02:10:01,119
so and this is also a typical example of

3348
02:10:01,119 --> 02:10:02,079
the

3349
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:04,639
cycle that you need to trade off between

3350
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:07,599
the exploitation exploration so you need

3351
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:10,800
to maximize your chance

3352
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,480
so a lot of people in this field are

3353
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:14,480
much familiar with this kind of trailer

3354
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:16,079
i will not go into the

3355
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:18,880
detail now i will try to explain to you

3356
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,960
about the strategy uh whether we have

3357
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:23,040
development

3358
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:24,719
so and now we try to formulate the

3359
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:26,480
problem and uh and there are some

3360
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,520
methods here and you can ignore that but

3361
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,119
they try to understand the high level

3362
02:10:31,119 --> 02:10:33,520
understanding and what the the math here

3363
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,079
is each time we have a x which is a

3364
02:10:36,079 --> 02:10:39,760
state of the agent of the robot and also

3365
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:42,719
you have a variable set of action you

3366
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:45,040
want to take and which is basically try

3367
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,520
to make the robot move forward backwards

3368
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,760
or left and right to move to different

3369
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,360
direction with different

3370
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,360
step size

3371
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:55,040
and also you have the moments the

3372
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,679
measurements in this case is you are

3373
02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:00,320
first is your gas magnet on the on on

3374
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,560
the sensor you can have chemical sensors

3375
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,960
on the on the robot and also you have

3376
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:07,040
send the moment about your position or

3377
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,119
your location with respect to the

3378
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:11,040
environment

3379
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:13,280
and the other things that we have is the

3380
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:16,560
unknown information about the source and

3381
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:18,239
also about the environment

3382
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:20,239
and which will include the location of

3383
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:21,599
their source

3384
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:24,960
and also include that

3385
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,560
constant environment like the wind

3386
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:28,159
direction and the speed which will

3387
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:31,040
significantly affect the dispersion of

3388
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:35,040
the chemicals or any uh audio

3389
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:38,159
so and the idea here is you take the

3390
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:40,480
connect all the data during the process

3391
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:43,119
and which is included anytime the action

3392
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,119
you take which is you

3393
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,679
and also the sensory sensor measurement

3394
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:49,679
but which is that here

3395
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:51,760
so you add all together give you

3396
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,320
something we call the information state

3397
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,880
which is a connection about all the data

3398
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,400
you have so far

3399
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,719
and then we decide what is a cost

3400
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:03,360
function or reward function it should be

3401
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,760
and in the simplest way what do you

3402
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,639
think about okay and my aim is to try to

3403
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:11,679
move my robot position close to the

3404
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:14,960
source location as close as possible

3405
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,360
which is quite a sensible uh

3406
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:20,000
the mayor but the problem now is i don't

3407
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,239
know where the source is location

3408
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:24,639
resolves it so what is this is why the

3409
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:27,360
condition on all the data is connected

3410
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:28,960
so far

3411
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,639
so it conditions this one trying to

3412
02:12:30,639 --> 02:12:32,960
minimize this cost function

3413
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:35,280
which is a typical way and in our

3414
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,040
control community and there is a

3415
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,440
particular name called the stochastic

3416
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:42,800
mtc model for the control

3417
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:45,520
and but what we want to do is move away

3418
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:48,320
from this just doing this we want to uh

3419
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,239
to further and because this will move

3420
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:53,280
further this is actually beautiful link

3421
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:56,880
with the active inference

3422
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:00,079
so what we do is now okay we're not just

3423
02:13:00,079 --> 02:13:02,560
the conditional on the other data we

3424
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:05,520
connect so far but also we connected on

3425
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:06,480
some

3426
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:09,119
virtual data so what is the basically is

3427
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,280
we also added the future

3428
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:14,079
all the the actions and what are the

3429
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:17,119
future outcomes so somewhat because you

3430
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:19,520
have a model he said oh if i do this

3431
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,280
what is going to happen what kind of

3432
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,599
moment i'm going to get if i do another

3433
02:13:23,599 --> 02:13:26,000
thing what can moment i'm going to get

3434
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,119
and how this man will affect my belief

3435
02:13:29,119 --> 02:13:31,599
of the world of the environment

3436
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:34,960
so that it means i now condition on not

3437
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:38,880
only on the ik but also condition on ik

3438
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:43,199
plus one and here and we need to have

3439
02:13:43,199 --> 02:13:44,400
taking into account

3440
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,280
the

3441
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:47,679
contraction on our future measurements

3442
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:49,920
and how future amendments will affect

3443
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:51,280
our belief

3444
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:54,000
okay but you know before i introduce the

3445
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
uh the detailed mathematics a little

3446
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,639
more method i try to give you uh some

3447
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:00,480
definition of mutation

3448
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,719
so suppose any time you have the

3449
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:05,040
probability density function of any

3450
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:07,360
unknown parameter theta you want

3451
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,360
estimate this is a

3452
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:12,079
pdf for b density function of that and

3453
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:14,880
if we take the the mean the expectation

3454
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,639
of that this will give you something we

3455
02:14:16,639 --> 02:14:19,199
call the nominal estimation

3456
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:21,199
okay use the mean of that as your

3457
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:23,920
nominal estimation and you try driving

3458
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:26,960
europe maybe to the nominal estimation

3459
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,400
location

3460
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,800
as a matter okay but also we have to

3461
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:34,159
quantify how the uncertain level of this

3462
02:14:34,159 --> 02:14:36,239
estimation

3463
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:38,800
so how reliable this your estimation

3464
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,560
about the environment so basically we

3465
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:44,800
define the error between them and then

3466
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,960
the nominal one and from any

3467
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,480
measurements then this will actually

3468
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:51,440
give us as a variance it will define the

3469
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:52,840
variance of this

3470
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,079
one so uh and once we

3471
02:14:56,079 --> 02:14:58,960
have this notation we can simplify the

3472
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:01,280
cost function we had before like like

3473
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:04,159
here but now is the condition around i k

3474
02:15:04,159 --> 02:15:07,119
plus one and it can simplify it into two

3475
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:10,239
terms the first term is about okay

3476
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:11,840
so

3477
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:14,800
we it may be the uh the active inference

3478
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,320
we call

3479
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:19,520
extrinsic value the second one is the

3480
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,480
intrinsic value the first part is okay i

3481
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:25,920
want to move my robot location to that

3482
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,079
believe the source location which is

3483
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:31,440
denoted by the normal estimation of your

3484
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,199
as a targeted

3485
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:35,679
location you want to make this error as

3486
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:38,079
close as possible so this is the task

3487
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:39,840
you want to perform something to

3488
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,079
basically move your robot close to where

3489
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:44,400
you believe it might be

3490
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:47,760
the second is how reliable disbelief

3491
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:50,880
and we quantify here by using the

3492
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:53,599
variance and initially remember those

3493
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:55,840
two relationship is derived from the

3494
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,280
very best

3495
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:59,360
the cost function there's no weight

3496
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:01,360
between the u2 is naturally this is the

3497
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,679
optimal way if you minimize this

3498
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:06,000
naturally the optimal way to do it

3499
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,239
so that that this the cost functions

3500
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:12,719
consist of two terms here which is uh

3501
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,239
the task of the objective you want to

3502
02:16:14,239 --> 02:16:16,560
perform and the uncertainty of your

3503
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:19,520
belief so you have that extrinsic and

3504
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,199
also interesting values

3505
02:16:21,199 --> 02:16:24,960
and optimal to combine them together

3506
02:16:25,119 --> 02:16:26,880
okay so now we can go to a little bit

3507
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,880
more detail about the equations and i

3508
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,480
will not go into too much but it

3509
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,160
basically is somehow like this is the

3510
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:35,120
best agency equation like as a next time

3511
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:37,280
the robot position depends on the your

3512
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,679
actions and also you have the dispersion

3513
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:41,920
model which is somehow like a ghosting

3514
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:44,240
model but it also depends on a number of

3515
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,959
parameters which is uh the wind speed

3516
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:49,040
wind direction what kind of chemicals

3517
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:52,160
you have they have some lifetime uh in

3518
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:54,240
the in the in the state in the air and

3519
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,478
then some other uh parameter associated

3520
02:16:56,478 --> 02:16:57,359
with the

3521
02:16:57,359 --> 02:16:59,439
location of the source

3522
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:02,398
but also we try to model the sensors and

3523
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:04,718
you should we should know that in the uh

3524
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:07,040
in the environment the chemical and also

3525
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,359
those viral agents their kind of changes

3526
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:12,318
are really low and many times it may be

3527
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:14,398
not able to detect anything

3528
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:16,398
but also you should also know they have

3529
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:18,718
lots of local turbulence which upset

3530
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:21,599
your sensor so that it means a lot of

3531
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:24,000
time you couldn't follow the gradient

3532
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,240
method try to say oh i fold the gradient

3533
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:28,638
i found the maximum

3534
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:30,718
concentration no it didn't work this is

3535
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:33,120
maybe what it looks like after the

3536
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:35,439
true dispersion fields you can see the

3537
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:38,000
concentration change quite dramatically

3538
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,558
so that's a challenging so we also need

3539
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:41,359
to

3540
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:43,840
model in the sense of behavior

3541
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,120
somehow like

3542
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:47,519
when the sensor you can have a reading

3543
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:49,599
so it's true reading plus some sensor

3544
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:52,160
noise whether many times you don't have

3545
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,679
sensor reading

3546
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:55,599
and so you just have purely have a

3547
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:57,840
background noise of your sensor so this

3548
02:17:57,840 --> 02:17:59,280
is another point

3549
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,920
and once we do that and we have the uh

3550
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,318
try to try to see what are the unknown

3551
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:06,318
parameters about the environment of our

3552
02:18:06,318 --> 02:18:08,879
source one estimate so basketball

3553
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:10,879
include the wind speed and the direct

3554
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:13,040
direction and and other things

3555
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:14,959
associated with the chemical components

3556
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:17,760
or i know them that parameters

3557
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:19,439
associated with the target i think it is

3558
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:22,160
the source location the release rate and

3559
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:25,200
then we can be using uh in our framework

3560
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:27,840
we're using basic uh inference uh to do

3561
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,840
to do it uh try to estimate those

3562
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:32,000
parameters

3563
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,558
so this is what the diagram looks like

3564
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:36,799
and so basically you have two parts one

3565
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:39,120
is about the reasoning another part is

3566
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,920
about the planning or control action in

3567
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:44,478
the rhythm every time it takes a new

3568
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:46,398
measurement and you based on the prior

3569
02:18:46,398 --> 02:18:49,040
information and the and the model you

3570
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,519
have this way more and you try to update

3571
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:53,760
your kind of visual estimation and then

3572
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,240
you build up a previous map about your

3573
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,558
local environment and then you fit this

3574
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:01,519
into your planning uh that here you try

3575
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:04,318
to estimate if you take any con action

3576
02:19:04,318 --> 02:19:06,240
what's the influence about your belief

3577
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:08,959
and always how to make your uh agent

3578
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:10,959
close to the source so you do the

3579
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:13,280
planning here and is this somehow like

3580
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,679
this red box is somehow like that you

3581
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:18,638
tried using your virtual or

3582
02:19:18,638 --> 02:19:20,959
a moment to do the reasoning and repeat

3583
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:22,879
this again and give you a dedication and

3584
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:26,398
then just keep doing this

3585
02:19:27,519 --> 02:19:29,840
and so you can do some simulation study

3586
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,920
about this for example if we start from

3587
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:34,160
here this is source this is a kind of

3588
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:36,558
changing and then we can put the source

3589
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:38,959
in different locations and as a agency

3590
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:40,638
different location to see how they are

3591
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:43,120
performed and then try to understand

3592
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:45,760
the behavior performance and what we can

3593
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:47,439
see is that

3594
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:49,680
if we quantify the performance in two

3595
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:52,399
ways one way is we call the successful

3596
02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:55,200
rate which is a and if we run the

3597
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,520
simulation 100 times or excellent 100

3598
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:00,399
times uh what's a successful rate so for

3599
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:02,560
the new approach you can achieve about

3600
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:03,680
100

3601
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:06,160
and for the uh some entropy based

3602
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:08,160
original hour method you can achieve

3603
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:10,479
about eighty percent chance found that

3604
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:12,479
if we're using uh classical model free

3605
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:14,479
control you always have about around

3606
02:20:14,479 --> 02:20:16,960
eighty percent of chance to found this

3607
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:19,520
another uh the mayor is about how

3608
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:22,880
quickly your conversion move to the the

3609
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,359
true source location which is denuded by

3610
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:29,520
distance uh from the agent to the

3611
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:30,880
source

3612
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:32,640
in terms of the root mean square because

3613
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:34,880
you run it many times and what you can

3614
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:38,880
see uh the our approach is actually can

3615
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:40,720
decrease very convergent to the source

3616
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:43,120
very quickly and but others is open

3617
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:46,640
slowly converge into that

3618
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:48,560
and we also can do the experiment this

3619
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:50,080
is exciting bit you can put on the

3620
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:52,720
physical uh robots try to let it wrong

3621
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:55,120
and then you can do that

3622
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:57,280
using the software to

3623
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,359
implement your high level argument at a

3624
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:01,680
low level you also have a control loop

3625
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,160
try to command your robot try to follow

3626
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,880
drive it and follow your high level uh

3627
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:09,040
the division to see where you want to

3628
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,720
move that really will follow that we're

3629
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:14,240
using the sensors and also and

3630
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,040
some level control to do it so here's

3631
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,560
some uh

3632
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:21,120
explaining result you can see it's very

3633
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,439
turbulent and the conditions change

3634
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:25,760
quite quickly the robot starts from any

3635
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:28,560
points and there's a purple point

3636
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:30,319
giving your idea about is that believe

3637
02:21:30,319 --> 02:21:32,160
where the source smile being represented

3638
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,160
by particle filters you can see with the

3639
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:37,200
time goes they're concentrating too uh

3640
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:38,479
closely and

3641
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:42,319
then to the um the location of the soil

3642
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:44,880
source and this is uh after that you can

3643
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,640
measure the area give you the idea about

3644
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,720
the concentration uh in this particular

3645
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:51,600
area and also we can do that in flight

3646
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:53,680
outside using your implement all the

3647
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:56,880
strategy on the uavs and the real test

3648
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:59,040
you can have the uh chemical sensors

3649
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,280
here this is a and

3650
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,680
all the other gps the cameras and all

3651
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,840
the sensors and you have a low level uh

3652
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:09,840
the ground control station are here

3653
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,920
and then you can do all the experiment

3654
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:14,000
outside they can this is a trial on the

3655
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,840
chemical plants they have a leakage of

3656
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:21,160
the gas and then what even happened and

3657
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:24,960
you can see uh the test and we did it

3658
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:26,160
and then

3659
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,319
and

3660
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:30,640
the industrial side and the uav taking

3661
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:32,960
off and they got the chemical sensors on

3662
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:35,359
that and they they don't lose and where

3663
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:36,960
are the sources they're based on that

3664
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:39,280
they give up some search strategy when i

3665
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:40,800
first started with we didn't do the

3666
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,040
intelligent research we just let the uav

3667
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,920
to fly around try to pick up the data

3668
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:47,760
and then we moved to intelligent

3669
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:50,960
research and try to demonstrate that so

3670
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:53,200
that pretend someone died because the

3671
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:54,560
the chemical

3672
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:56,560
leakage and then you need to send the

3673
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,240
uav to

3674
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:01,040
to identify where the uh the problem and

3675
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:03,680
then first respond can take a proper

3676
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,280
action

3677
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,760
to this

3678
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:12,319
so then we can map in the area this is

3679
02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:13,920
not the intelligent such one but it

3680
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:16,160
justify wrongly to connect the data

3681
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,000
beautiful understanding you can say

3682
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,880
where are they are but then we move to a

3683
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:24,080
fully uh intelligent search and then is

3684
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,760
somehow like hands off we don't have

3685
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,840
anyone that's that is fully that you're

3686
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:30,319
able to decide where to find to connect

3687
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:33,120
the data and them and and the child

3688
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,640
understand where they're so smiling

3689
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:37,119
could it be

3690
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:40,479
and this is another scenario i can see

3691
02:23:40,479 --> 02:23:42,319
here and you have

3692
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:44,560
the car here maybe this is simulated

3693
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:46,960
environment you have vehicle involving

3694
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:48,720
the accident whether you have any uh

3695
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:50,800
petrol a liquid to that because this

3696
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,760
might be it means you have a risk of the

3697
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,840
explosion under them if you send the

3698
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:58,479
first responder to this area that were

3699
02:23:58,479 --> 02:24:00,399
under the higher risk so if you could

3700
02:24:00,399 --> 02:24:03,520
have an agent to be there try to search

3701
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,720
uh where have any uh potential and

3702
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:09,520
leakage of gas under the um

3703
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:11,120
where there might be then you found

3704
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,120
found them

3705
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:14,640
so that's uh

3706
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:16,800
and there's some idea about it and doing

3707
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,520
the this kind of research and

3708
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,600
and then we also and

3709
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:23,200
develop this extent this one to more

3710
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,960
broad applications a particular one we

3711
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:27,680
call the self optimization control that

3712
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:31,359
the idea is for any uh or mozart

3713
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:33,920
system you want to maintain it operate

3714
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:37,120
in best possible way

3715
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:38,720
which can change with the environment

3716
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,720
because the way the environment changes

3717
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:42,560
the best possible operation way for the

3718
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:45,359
changes however you want you are

3719
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:48,080
you have a consistent and by taking the

3720
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,720
same idea as we already talked about

3721
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,399
they're able to explore the environment

3722
02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:54,720
influence on them they understand how to

3723
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:57,040
best operate themselves so somehow like

3724
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,439
here just change your environment and

3725
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:02,399
reward the function you just try to

3726
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:05,120
follow that and then try to do the best

3727
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:07,520
so there's many many applications i just

3728
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:10,080
talked about one this is a situation

3729
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:12,000
where we have you is about reliable

3730
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,200
energy you have a pv farm uh the energy

3731
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:18,000
and the aim is very simple

3732
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,240
you try to harvest as much energy as

3733
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:22,479
possible but the problem is the optimal

3734
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:24,160
operation is changing with the

3735
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,000
environment with the sunshine the

3736
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,080
temperature the the

3737
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,560
the sonar insulation has changed your

3738
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:31,600
operation

3739
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:34,800
optimal operation so what we developed

3740
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,040
is a strategy no matter what kind of

3741
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:38,399
weather condition you always can

3742
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:41,120
maintain the solar farm open in the best

3743
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,760
possible way it could be so the red one

3744
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,600
is ideal one

3745
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:46,800
the

3746
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:50,399
green one is actually what we uh

3747
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:52,399
the blue one is what we did you try to

3748
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:54,399
follow the optimal this is optimal

3749
02:25:54,399 --> 02:25:56,800
operation we always try to follow

3750
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,040
so that's some examples not only for the

3751
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,319
autonomous search but we can use

3752
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:01,760
australia

3753
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:04,640
to solve much wider range of problems

3754
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,399
now we talk about that relationship with

3755
02:26:06,399 --> 02:26:08,640
some others uh

3756
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:10,960
existing work one is sunday is a due

3757
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:12,560
country concept

3758
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:14,000
why we call dew control because the

3759
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,120
control action is not only changing your

3760
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:19,280
physical behavior of the u.s

3761
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:21,600
system but also changing your belief of

3762
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,600
the world of the environment so this is

3763
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:25,280
why you call it due control but it

3764
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,840
however is not complete new con concept

3765
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:30,240
in the control community we did this

3766
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:32,560
before but many on the dynamic system

3767
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:35,600
are estimate your own state how to

3768
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:38,240
understand some of your own parameters

3769
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:41,120
the idea now is try to extend from uh

3770
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,520
uav for example itself

3771
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:45,040
understand itself it's more to the

3772
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:46,640
environment because we think about it

3773
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:47,359
for

3774
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:50,560
autonomous driving for the uavs we have

3775
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:53,040
all those information about ourselves

3776
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:56,000
what we really need is the enviro

3777
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,439
information about the environment

3778
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:00,000
answering about the environment

3779
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,960
another link is uh with the uh

3780
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:05,920
the active uh in uh inference uh the the

3781
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:08,640
community and this is a very uh

3782
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,720
interesting surprise funding from me

3783
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,560
because when i developed a strategy i

3784
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:15,439
don't have any idea about this community

3785
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:18,080
and is that somehow like you can start

3786
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:20,399
from completely different area different

3787
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:22,160
angle but however you found that you're

3788
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,479
landing on the similar kind of idea or

3789
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,880
area so this is i think one of the most

3790
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:28,479
exciting things

3791
02:27:28,479 --> 02:27:29,359
in this

3792
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:31,680
research so so basically you can think

3793
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,399
about it is that uh that you control the

3794
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:37,200
idea is also about that your action will

3795
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,280
change uh

3796
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:41,840
your belief about the uh uh the

3797
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:44,080
environment and the you then connect the

3798
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:46,720
information this will again change your

3799
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:48,319
belief about that so there's the

3800
02:27:48,319 --> 02:27:50,800
interaction between the action and the

3801
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,800
perception and how they're connected

3802
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:55,438
with each other

3803
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:57,680
so i will not explain too much

3804
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,280
especially in this country people maybe

3805
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,439
must understand what i'm talking about

3806
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:03,840
and another is about it it's linked with

3807
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:07,280
us yeah it's linked with uh

3808
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:09,120
the world by the way there are some

3809
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:11,359
other research in this area another is

3810
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:13,439
about the reinforcement learning and

3811
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:15,439
this is my view about the link within

3812
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:17,520
reinforcement learning so basically the

3813
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:19,680
reinforcement learning is trying to make

3814
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:22,319
an optimal dedication for a given

3815
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:25,840
dynamic system and subject a

3816
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,160
reward function and then it proven

3817
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:30,319
itself converging to uh

3818
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:32,720
found a solution for a beyond equation

3819
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:34,240
basically

3820
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:35,840
and then what a reinforcement learning

3821
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:36,720
though is

3822
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:39,520
how to solve this problem by

3823
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:42,080
the optimal value function and also try

3824
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:44,720
to find the uh option uh personally

3825
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,399
found that

3826
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:49,520
optimal uh policy so idea you try to

3827
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,120
learn the strategy by through the

3828
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,800
iteration but what we do is that from uh

3829
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:57,120
the work i'm doing is developed from

3830
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,880
something we call that modal project

3831
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:01,439
control we try to solve the same problem

3832
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:03,920
but however with uh truncated the

3833
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:06,960
infinite horizon problem into uh

3834
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,640
finally the horizon problem so every

3835
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,960
time we try to solve uh find the horizon

3836
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:12,720
optimization problem find

3837
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:16,560
the uh optimal solution but uh

3838
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:18,560
reinforce them early and try to do using

3839
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:22,479
the iteration uh like uh uh

3840
02:29:22,479 --> 02:29:26,080
learning try to do that so basically and

3841
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:28,240
and the whole idea about link between

3842
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:30,399
them is actually explaining this paper

3843
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:32,880
and i just the publisher if anyone in

3844
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:34,640
the community interested in this and

3845
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:36,640
again please have a look this is my view

3846
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,399
about a link between those two and also

3847
02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:41,760
it's a link with active interference

3848
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,200
so and

3849
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,960
because the approach are different i

3850
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:46,800
just given the conclusion for the

3851
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:48,399
reinforcement learning they have three

3852
02:29:48,399 --> 02:29:50,720
major problems i think about it one is

3853
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:52,800
they need a lot of data to help them to

3854
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:54,399
learning the optimal strategy

3855
02:29:54,399 --> 02:29:56,960
opportunity function and the second is

3856
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:59,040
once if you learn from the simulation

3857
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:01,840
environment when the environment changes

3858
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:03,600
and oh there is a mismatch between your

3859
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:04,880
simulation environment the real

3860
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,720
environment the optimal strategy learned

3861
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:08,479
in a simulation environment will not

3862
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:10,960
work very well in real life and in

3863
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:13,760
particular in this case if i learn the

3864
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,359
try to search the

3865
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:16,399
sourcing

3866
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:18,560
based on this environment okay the wind

3867
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:20,560
comes to this direction speed i learned

3868
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:22,640
how to do it but if you come to real

3869
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:24,560
emergent situation the wing is actually

3870
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,560
blue to this direction

3871
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,160
the strategy you learn maybe doesn't

3872
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:31,200
work at all because it's not optimal

3873
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:34,640
another problem is actually that

3874
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,720
being frozen like black box is very

3875
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,319
difficult to prove the stability or

3876
02:30:38,319 --> 02:30:40,479
safety this kind of thing but we don't

3877
02:30:40,479 --> 02:30:41,280
have

3878
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,120
in the control we have a rich body of

3879
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,359
tools we are able to prove the stability

3880
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:47,120
safety and other things i think the

3881
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,760
first tool is able to solve by active

3882
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:53,040
inference as well like a new reducer the

3883
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:56,000
number of data required and also that

3884
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,439
have to deal with the unknown

3885
02:30:57,439 --> 02:30:59,600
environment but however that controls

3886
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:01,760
also have another uh office which is

3887
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:03,920
about safety

3888
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:07,200
about this so this is a quick try to

3889
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:10,000
think about how the link between the

3890
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,359
approach to talk about here and the

3891
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:13,280
reinforcement learning

3892
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:16,000
and and then we can discuss more itself

3893
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,359
for this particular talk then the the

3894
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:21,120
the kind of work whatever we are doing

3895
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:23,200
we try to

3896
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:25,439
move this from single step to multiple

3897
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:27,040
stack looking ahead and the final

3898
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,960
horizon but this will have a problem

3899
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:31,280
about a computational load because now

3900
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:32,720
we have to deal with a much higher

3901
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:34,399
capability how to reduce the

3902
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:36,960
combinational load is quite difficult

3903
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:39,600
and and last time when i talked with a

3904
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,840
car freeze it gave me some ideas about

3905
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:43,920
the team how to do it we are trying to

3906
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:45,920
learn from your community about how to

3907
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,200
reduce

3908
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:47,920
the

3909
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:49,840
computation alone

3910
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:51,680
another thing is what we are doing is we

3911
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:54,080
try to prove that a sense of rigorous

3912
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:55,840
properties for the

3913
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:57,760
approach somehow like to try to prove

3914
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:00,240
they can converge into the two sources

3915
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:02,479
and there if you do anything there your

3916
02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:05,439
belief can converge into true as a the

3917
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:08,080
external environment under them and and

3918
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:09,359
also and

3919
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:11,200
you are able to prove the safety of that

3920
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:13,200
which is particularly important for our

3921
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:14,880
area when we deal with cars and

3922
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:17,520
aircrafts we have to prove it is safe to

3923
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:20,560
do it so we are working on in those

3924
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:23,560
areas

3925
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:28,960
yeah so um yeah conclusion is uh

3926
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:31,840
we develop some new framework in our way

3927
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:33,280
and we try to

3928
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,200
make system cam operating on the

3929
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,520
environment by uh

3930
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:39,439
somehow like a trade-off between the

3931
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:41,840
exploitation exploration and try to

3932
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:44,000
understand the future action is

3933
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,200
influence on our belief so this is uh

3934
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:49,600
can deal with the coupling between the

3935
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:52,399
action and the belief and

3936
02:32:52,399 --> 02:32:53,520
and then

3937
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:55,520
our approach is not somehow like many

3938
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:56,880
other approaches they are saying about

3939
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:58,319
uh if you want to trade off your

3940
02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:01,439
artificial stitches uh uh interesting or

3941
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:03,840
extrinsic values together add some

3942
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,439
weight and it's actually this is

3943
02:33:05,439 --> 02:33:07,840
naturally it happened this is a

3944
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,080
it is optimal in some way

3945
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:11,920
and the particular center for us i think

3946
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:14,240
about it is we have a particular aware

3947
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,640
of the community of active experience we

3948
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:18,399
can learn a lot from there because they

3949
02:33:18,399 --> 02:33:19,600
have a

3950
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:21,520
community here people working in this

3951
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:23,840
area develop many good ideas and the

3952
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,680
question is how to send it to that how

3953
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:28,240
to promote more collaboration between

3954
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,479
those two communities i would think it's

3955
02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:33,920
one of the very interesting things to do

3956
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:36,000
so yeah that's all of my

3957
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,080
talk i think i very much come to the end

3958
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:40,720
of my time yeah it's 29 minutes now yeah

3959
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:44,279
so that's good

3960
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:59,120
okay yeah thanks yeah so i will join the

3961
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:03,000
roundtable yeah thank you

3962
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:06,800
yes okay thank you i will leave it first

3963
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:09,359
and we do join

3964
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:13,399
okay thank you

3965
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:32,640
all right well welcome back everyone

3966
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:35,359
so as it turns out

3967
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:38,560
we may or may not have any

3968
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:40,800
people join we will have just one

3969
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,240
join right now and then we'll see who

3970
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:45,600
else joins and

3971
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:49,520
so welcome back when what

3972
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:50,560
um

3973
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:53,920
was just saying that anyone who's in

3974
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:56,479
the live chat please feel free

3975
02:39:56,479 --> 02:39:57,840
to

3976
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:00,000
write any questions in the chat and

3977
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,880
we'll be looking at them

3978
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:05,200
when hua not sure who else will be

3979
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,439
joining us but i think actually this

3980
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:09,359
will be a a

3981
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:12,160
great opportunity just for as short as

3982
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:13,680
long as you'd like

3983
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:16,240
to talk a little bit about

3984
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:17,920
a little more about what you presented

3985
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:20,880
on and also connect to some threads that

3986
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:22,880
were happening earlier in the

3987
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,640
presentations how does that sound and

3988
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:27,519
we'll see who else joins

3989
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:34,199
sound good

3990
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:46,120
i actually don't hear you anymore

3991
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,040
okay one second we'll figure this out

3992
02:40:58,080 --> 02:41:00,319
yes

3993
02:41:00,319 --> 02:41:03,040
alright so we can hear you now um yeah

3994
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,200
okay sorry all right

3995
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,960
welcome so

3996
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:09,278
um

3997
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:12,080
we'll

3998
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:14,080
talk about some of the previous

3999
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:16,399
presentations not sure which ones you've

4000
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:18,000
seen and otherwise i'd like to pick up

4001
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,560
on a few threads in your presentation

4002
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:21,840
um

4003
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,439
and then we'll take any questions that

4004
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:24,800
people are asking live how does that

4005
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,960
sound

4006
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:28,479
yeah um

4007
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:30,479
awesome so

4008
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:33,520
one point that you highlighted was this

4009
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,439
notion of dual control

4010
02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:37,520
and how it brought you to some of the

4011
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:39,920
similar

4012
02:41:40,479 --> 02:41:43,279
places that active inference has arrived

4013
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:47,279
at so i'm curious what you think

4014
02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:48,720
led to that

4015
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,600
and

4016
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:52,000
what led to those vectors intersecting

4017
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,319
in a dual control

4018
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:57,040
and what is at that nexus or why does it

4019
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:59,760
exist that way and why is it coming

4020
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:03,439
clearer to the forefront at this time

4021
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:04,720
yeah thanks for that that's a very

4022
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:07,279
interesting question i know also i i

4023
02:42:07,279 --> 02:42:09,359
also think about it myself from time to

4024
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:10,240
time

4025
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:12,640
i think that there is a

4026
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:15,200
certainly those two areas i feel

4027
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,760
original was quite far away uh we have

4028
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:19,439
different strategies different way to

4029
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:21,600
think about the the world

4030
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:24,479
typically control we normally we are

4031
02:42:24,479 --> 02:42:27,840
interested in uh as i said the due

4032
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:31,040
control concept uh is not

4033
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:32,479
entirely new

4034
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:34,720
and uh the people in the in the control

4035
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:36,720
community already realized that many

4036
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:37,840
years ago

4037
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:40,800
somehow like if you take any action the

4038
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:44,479
action we are not a changing behavior of

4039
02:42:44,479 --> 02:42:47,200
a dynamic system but also maybe you

4040
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,160
could have

4041
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:49,439
some influence

4042
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:50,880
on

4043
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:53,200
the variables you are interested in in

4044
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:57,040
tragic traditional control this could be

4045
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:58,720
for a physical system there are some

4046
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:00,640
parameters yourself

4047
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:04,960
like a mess or a damping or other uh

4048
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:06,560
things that you don't know

4049
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,000
you by doing that will help you

4050
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,920
understand what you really are just like

4051
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:11,520
when you're driving your car you have

4052
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:13,520
some river you know what i mess or

4053
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,920
inertia my car have by doing some

4054
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,120
certain action

4055
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:19,920
so the people realized that uh before

4056
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:22,000
but the difference is now because we

4057
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,880
control the move from uh typical maybe

4058
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:27,760
can talk about low level automation now

4059
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:29,840
move to high level we call that

4060
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:33,600
intelligence or automation uh autonomy

4061
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:35,920
okay now you move to the more higher so

4062
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:39,040
then that means that you cheated that

4063
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,520
dynamics is like more like an agent in

4064
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:43,600
our way in our languages computer

4065
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:46,240
science or neuroscience is an agent so

4066
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:48,240
now we're more interested in not only

4067
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:51,040
about ourselves more interesting about

4068
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,680
the environment surrounding us the

4069
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:57,120
outside so my the work i think is now

4070
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:00,080
progress like what i did is move from

4071
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,760
you're concerned about your agent

4072
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,600
yourself more about what are the

4073
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:04,560
environment

4074
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:06,160
surrounding you how to explore the

4075
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,000
environment how to understand your

4076
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,720
behavior in the environment so by doing

4077
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:12,960
this i feel we bring the typical

4078
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:14,640
engineering heart

4079
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:17,359
sorry the control in feed into

4080
02:44:17,359 --> 02:44:19,439
this kind of natural water in this kind

4081
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:21,840
of biological kind of sense because now

4082
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,920
you're more interested in how to deal

4083
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:25,920
with coexisting with the environment how

4084
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:29,120
do we know so this is why i view on this

4085
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:31,120
and but on the other side this is also

4086
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:34,000
what i i reading on the on the active

4087
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,840
inference but suddenly this community

4088
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,880
have more say i feel traditionally

4089
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:40,960
before the due control people already

4090
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,600
have some idea about a treat human brain

4091
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,359
as a basing machine

4092
02:44:45,359 --> 02:44:47,040
so now he said okay i have prior

4093
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:48,880
information about the environment i have

4094
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:51,279
a new data coming helping you understand

4095
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:53,359
what is happening around me about the

4096
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:55,920
environment but i think what active

4097
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,200
interference

4098
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:59,040
for me i think about it

4099
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:00,720
suddenly the other wrong side of how we

4100
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:02,720
define the reward function and in

4101
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:05,120
particular talk about it using free

4102
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:07,439
energy to quantify that this is really

4103
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:09,600
wonderful to the world but also i think

4104
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:12,960
about it is key things here is

4105
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:14,399
is about

4106
02:45:14,399 --> 02:45:16,880
you now think about it i action the

4107
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:19,680
action is also linked with my uh

4108
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:21,200
understanding of the environment about

4109
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:23,920
perception so the carbon so using the

4110
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:26,240
action to explore uh

4111
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:27,680
the environment gives you better

4112
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,960
understanding

4113
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,800
so that it means you move from just that

4114
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:33,279
to the human as a passive way to receive

4115
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:34,800
the information from the environment

4116
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,399
nowadays that i can actively do

4117
02:45:36,399 --> 02:45:38,319
something helping me to better on the

4118
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:40,560
same one so i feel this may this is my

4119
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:43,279
understanding that the key feature of

4120
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:45,359
active inference so because this is the

4121
02:45:45,359 --> 02:45:47,279
reason you can see the naturally will

4122
02:45:47,279 --> 02:45:49,359
link with the control we talk about it

4123
02:45:49,359 --> 02:45:51,920
because the control normally talk about

4124
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:53,920
what is consequence of your action how

4125
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:55,760
to take the best action

4126
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:58,080
so this is why i feel those two areas

4127
02:45:58,080 --> 02:46:00,640
they from quite a different area

4128
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:02,319
gradually because the need for the

4129
02:46:02,319 --> 02:46:04,960
research and also

4130
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,640
something like a trend in the field they

4131
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:08,720
are now moved together

4132
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:10,479
in this particular area

4133
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:12,560
they come conversion

4134
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:15,200
to each other so this is

4135
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:17,840
what i'm thinking about

4136
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:20,319
awesome if i can just like

4137
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:21,920
pull out a few threads that i i thought

4138
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:23,760
were really insightful there

4139
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:24,479
so

4140
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:27,120
you you cited a paper from the 70s about

4141
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:29,359
this dual controlled notion the idea

4142
02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:31,439
that we had to have not just like a

4143
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:34,240
single imperative or have an imperative

4144
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,319
that contained epistemic and pragmatic

4145
02:46:36,319 --> 02:46:39,120
components and all that that entails

4146
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:41,920
like the unknown consequences of action

4147
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:43,760
so what we would have is like expected

4148
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:45,680
free energy as opposed to the

4149
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,479
variational free energy and then

4150
02:46:48,479 --> 02:46:50,000
you you described how there was a

4151
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,640
movement from lower level automation

4152
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:54,160
control systems

4153
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:56,640
the classical thermostat and other kind

4154
02:46:56,640 --> 02:47:01,120
of like um single variable yep single

4155
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:03,680
fixed point implementations

4156
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:04,640
and then

4157
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:07,279
as the implementation complexity

4158
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:09,520
approaches the multi-joint

4159
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:12,800
and way way way beyond how that

4160
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:15,600
multi-joint is going to be in a social

4161
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,520
context or

4162
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:20,319
a changing environment

4163
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:21,520
that

4164
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:24,800
system that's being designed

4165
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:27,600
comes to convergently require

4166
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:30,800
the same imperatives of a nervous system

4167
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:32,720
which is to say like the real-time

4168
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:35,279
integration of sparse

4169
02:47:35,279 --> 02:47:39,520
sensory data and also that is what

4170
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:41,200
authorizes

4171
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:44,240
the ecological stance and the embedded

4172
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:46,399
cognitive perspective which ties in with

4173
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:49,120
some other recent threads in

4174
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:50,800
cognitive science and neuroscience like

4175
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:52,640
the pragmatic turn

4176
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:54,880
and so it really is interesting how like

4177
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:58,240
from the technical capacity side

4178
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:01,120
the questions that were converged upon

4179
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:03,120
in terms of memory and forgetting and

4180
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:04,479
all these things

4181
02:48:04,479 --> 02:48:06,399
are like the challenges that natural

4182
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:08,080
systems have been involved in solving

4183
02:48:08,080 --> 02:48:10,800
for a long time

4184
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:13,279
yeah and that's absolutely right that's

4185
02:48:13,279 --> 02:48:15,279
a very very interesting part of their

4186
02:48:15,279 --> 02:48:18,160
technology develop but also there is a

4187
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:20,720
maybe demand from the society and

4188
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:22,399
because of lots of things like of the

4189
02:48:22,399 --> 02:48:24,960
traditional mechanical thermal kind of a

4190
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:27,840
simple control already while existing

4191
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:30,880
they help us to boost our productivity

4192
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:33,439
for many years but now we reach to the

4193
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:35,680
stage we want to further increase our

4194
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:38,479
productivity increase our efficiency you

4195
02:48:38,479 --> 02:48:40,560
have to develop a highly automatic

4196
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:43,680
system and which is able to deal with

4197
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,680
some unexpected events

4198
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:48,319
uncertainty and so in order to have this

4199
02:48:48,319 --> 02:48:51,040
kind of uh like capability

4200
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:52,720
they also require a high level of

4201
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:55,600
intelligence like our human or animal so

4202
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:57,439
this is actually another reason the

4203
02:48:57,439 --> 02:48:59,920
technology of the move is because

4204
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:02,399
the society and economic the demand for

4205
02:49:02,399 --> 02:49:05,920
this kind of thing to happen

4206
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:09,200
okay i have another question about your

4207
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:13,439
uh scenarios that you explored

4208
02:49:13,439 --> 02:49:14,479
how

4209
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:17,120
is explore exploit balanced

4210
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:19,920
automatically how can such a a large

4211
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:21,439
statement be made

4212
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:24,960
and how is it balanced when risk is in

4213
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:28,479
play like risk of going into a dangerous

4214
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:31,840
area so within the search task how is

4215
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:33,920
explore exploit

4216
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,600
uh mediated

4217
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:38,800
and then how does that become

4218
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:41,120
more complex or how is it integrated in

4219
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:43,680
the model when bodily injury is on the

4220
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:44,960
table

4221
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,800
yeah thanks for this yeah that's very

4222
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:49,920
interesting question and uh also we

4223
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:52,000
try to and think about this along

4224
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,479
ourselves for a while and the first i

4225
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:56,640
would like to say for just using the

4226
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:59,200
autonomous such this particular

4227
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:02,560
examples to illustrate the key ideas

4228
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:03,359
and

4229
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:05,760
the the fundamental objective for this

4230
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:08,479
particular task is very simple or clear

4231
02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:11,359
somehow like based on my understanding i

4232
02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:14,960
try to move our agent try to move close

4233
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:16,240
to

4234
02:50:16,240 --> 02:50:17,840
real life

4235
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:21,040
to resources okay so

4236
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:23,520
under them they will formulate this as a

4237
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:25,359
reward function or cost function somehow

4238
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:28,080
like you want to move your next times

4239
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,319
agent the location to

4240
02:50:30,319 --> 02:50:31,600
the source

4241
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:33,920
location as much as possible but however

4242
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:35,840
because you don't know that so there'll

4243
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:38,560
be conditional on all the information it

4244
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:40,080
connects so far

4245
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:42,880
so this is a the reward function your

4246
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:46,080
origin defined but from there we derived

4247
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:47,920
this particular function if

4248
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:50,880
formulating this kind of way and then

4249
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:53,439
and also try to introduce the

4250
02:50:53,439 --> 02:50:56,000
the note about it the action will affect

4251
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,279
our belief and then we'll naturally you

4252
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:01,200
found the cost function or the order

4253
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,479
function becomes

4254
02:51:02,479 --> 02:51:05,359
two terms won't consider two terms long

4255
02:51:05,359 --> 02:51:07,920
term is about the exploitation another

4256
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,880
term is about uh exploration so there's

4257
02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:13,439
a natural happening there is no like you

4258
02:51:13,439 --> 02:51:15,279
need to introduce some terms or they

4259
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:17,120
just naturally come together in this

4260
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:19,200
kind of way so this is why we think

4261
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:20,399
about is

4262
02:51:20,399 --> 02:51:21,920
maybe that is

4263
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:24,399
the best way to try to do that but also

4264
02:51:24,399 --> 02:51:26,399
you you you mentioned a very good

4265
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:28,960
question about the risk for example if

4266
02:51:28,960 --> 02:51:30,880
they naturally you're not only something

4267
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:32,880
like a target they want to follow but

4268
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:34,479
also during the process you need to

4269
02:51:34,479 --> 02:51:36,399
aware of kind of

4270
02:51:36,399 --> 02:51:38,399
risk there so

4271
02:51:38,399 --> 02:51:40,479
normally you have to deal with in our

4272
02:51:40,479 --> 02:51:43,439
framework in two ways one way is we have

4273
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:47,200
to add some constraints in our

4274
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:50,000
action generation it means for example

4275
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,319
one example is in our search if there is

4276
02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:55,200
a obstacle in some way if you command

4277
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:57,840
your vehicles or aircraft move to that

4278
02:51:57,840 --> 02:51:59,760
direction suddenly this risk because the

4279
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:01,439
client is going to collide with the

4280
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:05,040
obstacles we added the constraints in

4281
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:07,279
the search domain you said in this area

4282
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:09,600
you couldn't go this is one way to do

4283
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:11,840
that but also you can add some we call

4284
02:52:11,840 --> 02:52:14,000
it called softer constraints that means

4285
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,080
in the cost function you add some

4286
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:18,880
penalty in your cost function said okay

4287
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:20,399
there is some area

4288
02:52:20,399 --> 02:52:23,279
might have some risk you try to avoid if

4289
02:52:23,279 --> 02:52:24,319
possible

4290
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:27,439
and that when you generate or optimize

4291
02:52:27,439 --> 02:52:30,240
your uh your action you try to take this

4292
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:32,800
into account

4293
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:36,720
all right awesome i want to connect that

4294
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:38,960
to active inference and then ask a great

4295
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:40,880
question from dave

4296
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:42,800
so you mentioned

4297
02:52:42,800 --> 02:52:43,760
how

4298
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:47,279
various constraints could be provided to

4299
02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:49,840
prevent like situations of of risk or

4300
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:52,800
hazard to the entity

4301
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,640
and so that

4302
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:57,520
is uh what may work in practice and so

4303
02:52:57,520 --> 02:52:59,200
that's why it's been so interesting in

4304
02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:01,600
the presentations to see that

4305
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:04,240
most of them have featured at the very

4306
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:08,319
least um a laboratory robot

4307
02:53:08,319 --> 02:53:09,600
context

4308
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:14,880
and that kind of makes the full stack

4309
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:17,600
make makes uh increases our confidence

4310
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:19,680
that the full stack kind of touches like

4311
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:21,359
there's like a tesla coil like there is

4312
02:53:21,359 --> 02:53:22,800
a path through

4313
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:24,720
some implementation and then the

4314
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:26,560
question is how deep in the specifics do

4315
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:29,520
you have to go versus how um far up in

4316
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,120
the generalities

4317
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:33,920
and then there might be some

4318
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:36,240
situations where the constraint is

4319
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:38,880
applied in a very situational way

4320
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:40,240
but also

4321
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:41,200
as you

4322
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:43,200
laid out

4323
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:45,120
dual control and reinforcement learning

4324
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:46,880
you said reinforcement learning is not

4325
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:48,880
really amenable to being

4326
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:52,080
formalized analytically in practice

4327
02:53:52,080 --> 02:53:54,800
whereas um one active inference strategy

4328
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:57,600
that we've seen to balance like a task

4329
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:00,319
performance with survival is you say i

4330
02:54:00,319 --> 02:54:02,640
want to reduce my surprise about the gas

4331
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:05,120
cloud and i want to reduce surprise and

4332
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:07,359
have a high battery percentage

4333
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:08,399
so then

4334
02:54:08,399 --> 02:54:09,439
it will

4335
02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:12,160
just like balancing explore exploit

4336
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:15,760
within a drive like to detect the gas or

4337
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:19,840
to stay high battery it also can have a

4338
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:22,640
nested model that's balancing those

4339
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:24,160
drives

4340
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:26,319
and so there's also an

4341
02:54:26,319 --> 02:54:27,680
analytically

4342
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:30,080
simple and first principles way

4343
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:31,359
to

4344
02:54:31,359 --> 02:54:34,560
bring homeostasis and risk avoidance

4345
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:37,040
into very generalized framings of the

4346
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:38,960
active inference framework

4347
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:41,600
and then again in the specifics it might

4348
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:45,520
be useful to do different model uh

4349
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:48,479
variations closer to the edge but then

4350
02:54:48,479 --> 02:54:49,840
it's very interesting to think about

4351
02:54:49,840 --> 02:54:52,000
what it looks like when also there's

4352
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,080
something in the center

4353
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:57,120
that has a simplicity to it

4354
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,960
yeah yeah yeah thanks for that that's a

4355
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:00,560
very useful discussion

4356
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:01,359
uh

4357
02:55:01,359 --> 02:55:04,000
are different ways we can deal with the

4358
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,479
balance between the uh you want to do

4359
02:55:06,479 --> 02:55:08,080
what you want to do and also try to

4360
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:10,640
avoid any risk or beautifuls and then

4361
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:12,800
try to balance try to deal with

4362
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:14,960
particularly i think the problem here

4363
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:17,680
my feeling is called uncertainty

4364
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:19,359
because on sunday will have

4365
02:55:19,359 --> 02:55:21,040
affect all those things because if you

4366
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:23,359
think about risk how relia

4367
02:55:23,359 --> 02:55:25,520
how possible reliability this risk might

4368
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:28,479
be so there is a lot of things like this

4369
02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:29,680
and

4370
02:55:29,680 --> 02:55:30,800
my uh

4371
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:32,640
this will come back to my uh my

4372
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:34,720
fellowship my fellowship was funded by

4373
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:37,760
epsrc for five years i concentrated on

4374
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:39,840
this particular area the goal of my

4375
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:41,600
fellowship as we already somehow

4376
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:43,680
indicated we tried to increase the level

4377
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:45,760
of autonomy by if there's more

4378
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:48,399
intelligence arguing into the control

4379
02:55:48,399 --> 02:55:50,319
and and on other

4380
02:55:50,319 --> 02:55:53,840
field but one of the the idea for me is

4381
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:55,279
i we could

4382
02:55:55,279 --> 02:55:57,200
want to develop something we call that

4383
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:00,640
goal oriented control system it means we

4384
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:02,640
want to promote because high level of

4385
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:04,160
intelligence like us

4386
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:05,920
people or animals

4387
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:07,920
they are more have a goal-oriented

4388
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:10,479
behavior you rather than just people you

4389
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:12,240
said oh i give you the goal you try to

4390
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:14,399
figure out how to do it if you have a

4391
02:56:14,399 --> 02:56:16,080
next intelligent one he said oh i need

4392
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:18,240
to give you instruction every step about

4393
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:20,880
how to do things properly so the first

4394
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:21,600
is

4395
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:23,359
to promote the goal in the behavior i

4396
02:56:23,359 --> 02:56:25,359
said okay for this particular what is

4397
02:56:25,359 --> 02:56:27,520
the task what do we want to achieve what

4398
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:28,720
a requirement

4399
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:30,800
so then second things in the key

4400
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:32,880
integrating my framework is about the

4401
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:35,279
constraints the why the constraint is so

4402
02:56:35,279 --> 02:56:37,600
important because you try to avoid any

4403
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:40,479
like before any risk of things or

4404
02:56:40,479 --> 02:56:42,800
for example if you want to develop

4405
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:44,640
autonomous driving cars you have to

4406
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:45,920
follow the

4407
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:48,240
rule of the traffic at the road and they

4408
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:49,760
have to follow that and they have

4409
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:51,439
followed the traffic light and other

4410
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:52,560
things

4411
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,640
and they and you don't want to collide

4412
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:57,920
with any other vehicles or uh or hit any

4413
02:56:57,920 --> 02:56:59,760
potential so those are the constraints

4414
02:56:59,760 --> 02:57:01,920
you have safety concerns in this case

4415
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:03,359
but you also have a lot of physical

4416
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:05,279
constraints because if they have a

4417
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:06,720
maximum power

4418
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:08,960
maximum like temperature or pressure

4419
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:10,720
your system could have otherwise you are

4420
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:13,200
going to destroy yourself so constraints

4421
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:16,399
play a very key role here but the sunday

4422
02:57:16,399 --> 02:57:18,080
the question as you said four different

4423
02:57:18,080 --> 02:57:20,880
scenarios how to abstract formula this

4424
02:57:20,880 --> 02:57:22,880
constraints is a question but the whole

4425
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:25,840
idea is you have to for any decision or

4426
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:28,640
action you made you have to respect

4427
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:30,479
those constraints

4428
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:32,240
before you try to think about oh wow

4429
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:34,840
won't achieve any uh meaningful

4430
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:37,439
objective the another key

4431
02:57:37,439 --> 02:57:39,840
part of this one is uncertainty

4432
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:42,560
the onsen they came from many many ways

4433
02:57:42,560 --> 02:57:44,399
could be the environmental changes or

4434
02:57:44,399 --> 02:57:46,720
onsen we already talked about it but

4435
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:48,160
also could be answered about your

4436
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:50,160
information because you have a sensor

4437
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:52,319
sensor could have error or the sensor

4438
02:57:52,319 --> 02:57:54,399
range is not enough to pick up all the

4439
02:57:54,399 --> 02:57:57,120
information you need and there is a yeah

4440
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:59,520
so there are so and also you answer

4441
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:01,600
their body your belief of the world for

4442
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:03,439
example we talk about the

4443
02:58:03,439 --> 02:58:06,800
risk but how reliable this risk it'll be

4444
02:58:06,800 --> 02:58:08,000
could it be

4445
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,800
so that i will think about it and this

4446
02:58:10,800 --> 02:58:13,439
is my belief in the whole framework

4447
02:58:13,439 --> 02:58:15,359
for uh you control

4448
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:17,600
the key thing is about how to quantify

4449
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,279
the answer

4450
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:21,040
about your belief of the surrounding

4451
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:22,399
environment

4452
02:58:22,399 --> 02:58:24,560
this is driving you are you rewarded

4453
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:25,680
somehow like

4454
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:26,640
expert

4455
02:58:26,640 --> 02:58:28,800
exploration

4456
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:31,120
so those are the key things in my view

4457
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:34,160
and basically if what our idealization

4458
02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:35,680
is think about you talk about in the

4459
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:36,560
active

4460
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:39,040
inference we are able to formulate that

4461
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:40,960
in electrical way

4462
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:43,279
and then we are formulated in electrical

4463
02:58:43,279 --> 02:58:45,840
way we are able to using some tools or

4464
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:48,800
theory people developing the last 30 50

4465
02:58:48,800 --> 02:58:50,000
years in particular in the control

4466
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,399
community and other community we're able

4467
02:58:52,399 --> 02:58:54,960
to formally prove if we do it in this

4468
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:57,680
way we can make sure you are able to

4469
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:00,640
satisfy certain safety requirement it

4470
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:02,880
will not hit the some obstacles you'll

4471
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:04,880
not put yourself in the danger in the

4472
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:07,520
for example like you eat in the natural

4473
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:09,279
world either by other animals for

4474
02:59:09,279 --> 02:59:11,200
example so so

4475
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:13,840
you this is the dream we have some

4476
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:15,920
progress in this area we're already able

4477
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:18,560
to do some a very simple system we are

4478
02:59:18,560 --> 02:59:22,080
able to prove stability or safety of the

4479
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:24,720
uh that you control but however is and

4480
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:27,040
we want to do is try to extend a much

4481
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:29,200
wider world and therefore the free

4482
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:31,120
energy principle

4483
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:32,720
is much more difficult because the

4484
02:59:32,720 --> 02:59:34,880
energy the functioning level is quite

4485
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:37,680
complicated how to understand that is

4486
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:39,600
another level of difficult but however

4487
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:41,840
in principle we are able to work

4488
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:45,359
together to push this

4489
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:47,359
thank you there was really a lot in

4490
02:59:47,359 --> 02:59:50,479
there i'd like to make one remark on

4491
02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:51,920
active inference

4492
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:53,760
and then bridge to

4493
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:55,760
dave's question in the chat

4494
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:58,399
so you highlighted uncertainty

4495
02:59:58,399 --> 03:00:01,439
and that's of course a core aspect of

4496
03:00:01,439 --> 03:00:03,359
active inference with bounding surprise

4497
03:00:03,359 --> 03:00:05,279
using free energy and then you mentioned

4498
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:06,880
goals and constraints

4499
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:10,720
and that really seemed to me like a a

4500
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:13,359
common point with cybernetics and goal

4501
03:00:13,359 --> 03:00:15,600
orientation constraints general systems

4502
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:18,399
theory cybernetics branch but also

4503
03:00:18,399 --> 03:00:20,720
engineering and entrepreneurship and

4504
03:00:20,720 --> 03:00:23,680
innovation as your colleague stephen fox

4505
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:24,479
has

4506
03:00:24,479 --> 03:00:25,600
worked on

4507
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:28,479
and those perspectives on goals and

4508
03:00:28,479 --> 03:00:31,439
constraints of potentially nested

4509
03:00:31,439 --> 03:00:33,680
systems of organization like projects

4510
03:00:33,680 --> 03:00:35,840
within an organization

4511
03:00:35,840 --> 03:00:36,880
or

4512
03:00:36,880 --> 03:00:38,800
a firm within a market

4513
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:41,359
or a cyber physical system nested within

4514
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:43,040
a firm within a market

4515
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:45,439
yeah to have interfaces

4516
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:48,640
that can even just be described

4517
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:51,359
in an information partition way

4518
03:00:51,359 --> 03:00:53,359
and then you brought it back to safety

4519
03:00:53,359 --> 03:00:54,880
and to be able to have certain like

4520
03:00:54,880 --> 03:00:57,520
probabilistic or formal guarantees on

4521
03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:00,000
those kinds of arbitrarily composed

4522
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:01,200
systems

4523
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:04,240
is very exciting direction um any

4524
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:06,319
remarks on that or i'll ask the question

4525
03:01:06,319 --> 03:01:07,520
from dave

4526
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:09,359
i just have a quick remark i think it

4527
03:01:09,359 --> 03:01:10,319
really

4528
03:01:10,319 --> 03:01:12,160
for me i'm more on the technology side

4529
03:01:12,160 --> 03:01:14,479
but however is absolute this kind of

4530
03:01:14,479 --> 03:01:16,240
goal in the behavior you can using for

4531
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:19,200
the social organization for the

4532
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:21,040
biological or many many other things

4533
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:23,040
because basically when you survive you

4534
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,960
have a goal this goal you try to survive

4535
03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:26,880
on the food and then the society you

4536
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:28,800
want a new organization the goal is to

4537
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:31,439
try to find more profit constrained by

4538
03:01:31,439 --> 03:01:32,880
the kind of marketing environment and

4539
03:01:32,880 --> 03:01:35,279
many other things yeah yeah i absolutely

4540
03:01:35,279 --> 03:01:37,359
agree with you

4541
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:39,120
i'm just gonna make one more comment to

4542
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:40,960
refer back to an earlier talk not sure

4543
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:42,479
if you saw this one but this was tim

4544
03:01:42,479 --> 03:01:45,120
verbellen's talk and he was talking

4545
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:46,720
about video games

4546
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:50,000
and about how just with a only

4547
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:50,880
a

4548
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:52,800
epistemic drive

4549
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:54,479
some of these video games were able to

4550
03:01:54,479 --> 03:01:56,880
be played very well like with pong and

4551
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:59,200
with mario and then it made me think

4552
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:00,479
about how in a lot of video games

4553
03:02:00,479 --> 03:02:02,960
staying alive is an imperative whether

4554
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:05,680
you're just tapping something or a maze

4555
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:07,680
or something that's growing or shrinking

4556
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:10,080
it's like staying alive

4557
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:12,479
bridges the gap between

4558
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:15,200
search and exploit and all these

4559
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:17,040
different behavioral modes it's like if

4560
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:18,880
you're not staying alive if there's no

4561
03:02:18,880 --> 03:02:21,920
like idle process for your cpu

4562
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:24,800
then it's over so then yeah there's no

4563
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:27,920
point in future epochs so that's

4564
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:29,359
really interesting so let me go to

4565
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:30,640
dave's question

4566
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:33,040
so dave uh wrote

4567
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:34,880
professor chen i didn't notice

4568
03:02:34,880 --> 03:02:37,760
discussion in your presentation of of

4569
03:02:37,760 --> 03:02:41,520
affect or emotion or drive

4570
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,120
what do you think about adding such

4571
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:46,080
mechanisms to the dual control model

4572
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,560
could this amount to explicating

4573
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:51,520
internally generated motivations

4574
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:54,080
or would such a trick be a mere disguise

4575
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:56,640
for inserting arbitrary experience

4576
03:02:56,640 --> 03:03:00,080
experimenter specified rewards

4577
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:01,680
yeah

4578
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:03,439
that's that's very interesting question

4579
03:03:03,439 --> 03:03:05,279
and when am i

4580
03:03:05,279 --> 03:03:08,080
reading the uh literature in active

4581
03:03:08,080 --> 03:03:10,960
inference and i'm fully aware of that

4582
03:03:10,960 --> 03:03:13,040
the focus of our research is quite a

4583
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:16,000
layer and we focus on do something uh

4584
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,479
specific or useful and in this case for

4585
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:20,240
example in the case uh the autonomous

4586
03:03:20,240 --> 03:03:22,080
search is just try to find

4587
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:22,880
uh

4588
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:26,000
the location resources and in the in the

4589
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,720
pv farm for generated renewable energy

4590
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:31,120
the object is quite simple said okay we

4591
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:33,279
want to harvest as much energy as

4592
03:03:33,279 --> 03:03:36,080
possible given the condition so in that

4593
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:37,120
one means

4594
03:03:37,120 --> 03:03:39,200
the focus of our one is a

4595
03:03:39,200 --> 03:03:41,439
very specific but however when we come

4596
03:03:41,439 --> 03:03:43,840
to the biological and also human and

4597
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:45,680
others they have a lot of things like

4598
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:48,479
the the emotion and many other things we

4599
03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:51,040
didn't consider in to in our current

4600
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:53,760
work and i i can see this is the gap

4601
03:03:53,760 --> 03:03:56,160
between the due control and the active

4602
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:58,319
inference is actually you can deal with

4603
03:03:58,319 --> 03:04:01,439
talk about a more general uh skills like

4604
03:04:01,439 --> 03:04:04,640
empower or confidence or some other more

4605
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:06,720
things emotional things

4606
03:04:06,720 --> 03:04:08,560
and and this is actually the direction

4607
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:10,800
of the maybe the future of the and our

4608
03:04:10,800 --> 03:04:13,040
work should move try to learn from this

4609
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:15,439
community over that but in principle and

4610
03:04:15,439 --> 03:04:18,399
as i said if we are able to formulate

4611
03:04:18,399 --> 03:04:19,920
those kind of emotions or many other

4612
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:22,800
things as kind of a reward function for

4613
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:25,600
example you you you encourage people to

4614
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:27,920
be happy to but you need to have some

4615
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:30,479
way to quantify that if you couldn't uh

4616
03:04:30,479 --> 03:04:32,720
capture that maybe you will not promote

4617
03:04:32,720 --> 03:04:35,520
the behavior uh try to

4618
03:04:35,520 --> 03:04:38,319
get make you happier so that is the key

4619
03:04:38,319 --> 03:04:41,520
things for us is how to uh formulate uh

4620
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:43,680
interesting uh

4621
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:46,560
reward function and and this is also

4622
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:48,399
what you can learn from active inference

4623
03:04:48,399 --> 03:04:50,479
in principle and we didn't have a

4624
03:04:50,479 --> 03:04:52,479
restriction on what time

4625
03:04:52,479 --> 03:04:53,760
what type of

4626
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:55,760
reward function should it be what type

4627
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:57,600
of constraints should it be the

4628
03:04:57,600 --> 03:04:59,200
framework is quite

4629
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:01,040
in some ways quite a

4630
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:03,600
general but however for more complicated

4631
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:05,920
systems still did a lot of work yeah

4632
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:08,800
that's very interesting

4633
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:11,600
if i could uh build on that so i was

4634
03:05:11,600 --> 03:05:14,880
imagining the setting of

4635
03:05:14,880 --> 03:05:17,279
firefighters and there's some

4636
03:05:17,279 --> 03:05:18,479
different chemicals that are being

4637
03:05:18,479 --> 03:05:19,600
sensed

4638
03:05:19,600 --> 03:05:21,760
and about the way that the extended

4639
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:25,359
cognition paradigm and seeing the cyber

4640
03:05:25,359 --> 03:05:27,200
physical team

4641
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:29,760
as being just qualitatively whatever

4642
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:31,359
tools they're using even if it's just

4643
03:05:31,359 --> 03:05:32,960
the walkie-talkie

4644
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:35,040
and their bodies it's still like an

4645
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:38,080
extended cyber physical team and then

4646
03:05:38,080 --> 03:05:40,399
as we move forward into futures that may

4647
03:05:40,399 --> 03:05:42,240
in different areas like include all

4648
03:05:42,240 --> 03:05:44,160
kinds of tools that we do and don't know

4649
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:45,120
about

4650
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:47,200
so then that's what's interesting about

4651
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:50,640
a framework that can start and pick up

4652
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:52,399
in the um

4653
03:05:52,399 --> 03:05:54,399
like qualitative zone

4654
03:05:54,399 --> 03:05:56,479
and then also take it all the way to the

4655
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:57,760
application

4656
03:05:57,760 --> 03:06:00,960
and then as to value alignment i thought

4657
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:04,640
that what you just added had um some

4658
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:06,319
seeds of

4659
03:06:06,319 --> 03:06:09,520
new ways to think about the human

4660
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:11,439
robot or just more generally the

4661
03:06:11,439 --> 03:06:14,240
multi-entity alignment question and that

4662
03:06:14,240 --> 03:06:17,600
is their preference vectors or some of

4663
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:20,240
their preference vectors

4664
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:23,040
could be about the same thing and in the

4665
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:25,359
same direction like the semantics of

4666
03:06:25,359 --> 03:06:28,880
what the firefighter on the survey says

4667
03:06:28,880 --> 03:06:31,920
i want i want to like balance x and y

4668
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:34,479
and z in this ratio and then there can

4669
03:06:34,479 --> 03:06:36,080
be an entity

4670
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:38,160
whether that's another person

4671
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:41,279
or some kind of explicitly structured

4672
03:06:41,279 --> 03:06:43,920
cyber physical entity that also has that

4673
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:46,080
same like preference distribution

4674
03:06:46,080 --> 03:06:47,200
and then yeah

4675
03:06:47,200 --> 03:06:49,439
that is like a formal way

4676
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:52,800
to find that probabilistic alignment

4677
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:54,640
because the question has to be addressed

4678
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:56,720
one way or the other and how will those

4679
03:06:56,720 --> 03:07:00,240
distributions align accidentally

4680
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:03,920
or using some other simple heuristic

4681
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:06,240
yeah that's absolute is actually when we

4682
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:08,240
talk with our end user and also

4683
03:07:08,240 --> 03:07:11,200
firefighter and also the

4684
03:07:11,200 --> 03:07:12,880
minister of defense they're interesting

4685
03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:14,560
therefore the terrorist attack or some

4686
03:07:14,560 --> 03:07:16,640
other kind of things you know in

4687
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:18,399
london in the tube station there's some

4688
03:07:18,399 --> 03:07:20,640
scenario like this and here they'll talk

4689
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:21,920
about is

4690
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:24,479
very rarely just send the robot out and

4691
03:07:24,479 --> 03:07:25,840
let it do

4692
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:27,439
off do all the things he's actually

4693
03:07:27,439 --> 03:07:29,279
always have an interaction between the

4694
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:31,200
first responder and the robot really

4695
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:32,880
want to pass the information about oh

4696
03:07:32,880 --> 03:07:35,680
where i thought it might be and then the

4697
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:37,920
the the operator first to provide some

4698
03:07:37,920 --> 03:07:39,840
extra information and they'll always

4699
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:41,840
work together as a team and also there's

4700
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:44,080
some preferences for example in some

4701
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:46,399
areas based on the

4702
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:48,319
first responders experience they knew

4703
03:07:48,319 --> 03:07:50,000
where they are more likely could it be

4704
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,080
that when they see a picture or see the

4705
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:53,439
season so there is always the

4706
03:07:53,439 --> 03:07:54,720
interaction with that yeah absolutely

4707
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:57,279
this is actually our future step is

4708
03:07:57,279 --> 03:07:59,600
somehow like to promote this kind of

4709
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:02,640
interaction between the human that in in

4710
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:04,479
some interference and many other

4711
03:08:04,479 --> 03:08:06,560
emotional other urgent things because

4712
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:09,120
some area if you close to maybe

4713
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:11,040
exit or somebody you maybe

4714
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:13,040
have a priority to search or find

4715
03:08:13,040 --> 03:08:16,720
whether there's some probe there so

4716
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:20,000
okay a few remarks on that so it made me

4717
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,520
think about how

4718
03:08:21,520 --> 03:08:23,200
the response

4719
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:25,920
network like of an emergency could be

4720
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:28,960
seen as embodying a prior like where i

4721
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:32,000
am in california maybe firefights are a

4722
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,160
certain likelihood different seasons so

4723
03:08:34,160 --> 03:08:35,040
then

4724
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:38,319
um a phone call to emergency services

4725
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:40,160
might have a different likelihood of

4726
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:42,000
something being the case in one region

4727
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:43,920
versus another or it could be kind of

4728
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:45,840
used in like a bayesian filtering way

4729
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:47,760
where are we getting 15 reports of the

4730
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:49,840
same thing and then where are we like

4731
03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:51,120
we're already

4732
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:53,120
working on that situation and there's

4733
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:54,720
something else that needs attention to

4734
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:56,160
be brought to it so we don't want to

4735
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:58,640
like have a sampling bias and then that

4736
03:08:58,640 --> 03:09:01,040
question of how training data

4737
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:03,920
in a static learning context

4738
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:06,479
results in basically like biased

4739
03:09:06,479 --> 03:09:08,720
implementations in the real world was

4740
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:12,000
was a theme of several of the talks um

4741
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:15,200
a question i wanted to ask was about the

4742
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:16,800
turbulence

4743
03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:18,560
of the

4744
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:20,479
flow

4745
03:09:20,479 --> 03:09:23,760
it brings a

4746
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:25,840
chaotic

4747
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:29,200
multi-peak landscape because what i saw

4748
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:31,279
in the cloud was there's like it's like

4749
03:09:31,279 --> 03:09:33,760
island chain

4750
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:37,439
it's not just one ridge

4751
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:39,680
and so um

4752
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:42,319
how does a

4753
03:09:42,319 --> 03:09:45,640
smooth gaussian variational

4754
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:47,439
approximation

4755
03:09:47,439 --> 03:09:49,680
make sense of something that otherwise

4756
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:52,160
we might think we would use like complex

4757
03:09:52,160 --> 03:09:54,560
simulations to resolve

4758
03:09:54,560 --> 03:09:56,479
i think you're a really expert that's a

4759
03:09:56,479 --> 03:09:58,239
really good question and we struggle

4760
03:09:58,239 --> 03:10:00,800
with this for quite a while and

4761
03:10:00,800 --> 03:10:01,760
and

4762
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:03,760
you can think about that

4763
03:10:03,760 --> 03:10:05,920
you have a lot of local turbulence is

4764
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:09,279
there and also uh com coupled with

4765
03:10:09,279 --> 03:10:11,760
any case if you have a chemical biology

4766
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:13,600
dispersion the concentration of the air

4767
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:15,520
is actually really low

4768
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:18,000
and and also for our uav the small

4769
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:21,279
drones or the uh the robot the sensors

4770
03:10:21,279 --> 03:10:23,600
they carry is not very advanced you

4771
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:26,800
can't carry some level uh grade very

4772
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:28,960
comprehensive equivalent is actually we

4773
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:32,319
use a very simple uh gas sensor so that

4774
03:10:32,319 --> 03:10:34,399
means you have a high level of

4775
03:10:34,399 --> 03:10:38,160
that mis detection or and and also this

4776
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:40,399
what makes it even worse is because you

4777
03:10:40,399 --> 03:10:42,479
talk about it that the turbulence you

4778
03:10:42,479 --> 03:10:46,319
can make and when we operate on the uav

4779
03:10:46,319 --> 03:10:47,600
the propeller

4780
03:10:47,600 --> 03:10:49,840
didn't help us it itself it generates

4781
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:52,080
lots of local fluid it's upset our

4782
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:54,479
sensor so it's hard now it's somewhat

4783
03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:56,319
appreciated lots of hard work getting

4784
03:10:56,319 --> 03:10:59,120
into this area but but try to answer

4785
03:10:59,120 --> 03:11:00,560
your question is

4786
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:03,040
and when we uh reasoning

4787
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:06,080
we could use a more complicated model

4788
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:08,720
but however the complicated model

4789
03:11:08,720 --> 03:11:11,200
sometimes didn't give us in this case

4790
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:14,080
didn't give us too much benefit for to

4791
03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:16,800
reading one reason is uh the complicated

4792
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:19,760
model is always have a um because the

4793
03:11:19,760 --> 03:11:21,680
environment have a high level of

4794
03:11:21,680 --> 03:11:23,520
uncertainty

4795
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:25,600
and even you have a complicated model if

4796
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:27,520
it's accuracy to represent a real

4797
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:29,600
environment then that's a complete model

4798
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:31,760
give you benefit you feel that come the

4799
03:11:31,760 --> 03:11:33,279
model

4800
03:11:33,279 --> 03:11:35,520
is environment is so much uncertain

4801
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:39,200
there maybe the simple good enough model

4802
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:41,040
is able to do the job there's a first

4803
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:43,040
question but also by using a simple

4804
03:11:43,040 --> 03:11:45,760
model it can signify driving you a

4805
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:47,920
computational lower down the simple

4806
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:50,000
gaussian mode it is very simple but

4807
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,399
however you are able to driving your

4808
03:11:52,399 --> 03:11:53,760
computational lower down because

4809
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:55,439
compared with a

4810
03:11:55,439 --> 03:11:56,960
safety model computational fluid

4811
03:11:56,960 --> 03:11:59,359
dynamics mode or more complicated model

4812
03:11:59,359 --> 03:12:01,279
uh second is because there's a

4813
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:03,120
particular scenario

4814
03:12:03,120 --> 03:12:06,399
the uh the sensor is not high grade so a

4815
03:12:06,399 --> 03:12:08,960
lot of onsen they caused by model maybe

4816
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:10,560
uh just the uh

4817
03:12:10,560 --> 03:12:11,680
display

4818
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:13,520
within the sensor noise because that

4819
03:12:13,520 --> 03:12:15,439
noise is quite high even you try to push

4820
03:12:15,439 --> 03:12:16,960
it more and more and more accurately but

4821
03:12:16,960 --> 03:12:18,720
it's just maybe one percent since the

4822
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:21,200
sensor lawyers give you five percent so

4823
03:12:21,200 --> 03:12:23,120
it didn't give you too much benefit this

4824
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:26,960
is what we found in this situation

4825
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,720
so i'd like to

4826
03:12:30,880 --> 03:12:32,720
maybe connect that

4827
03:12:32,720 --> 03:12:34,560
gas dissipating

4828
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:36,720
setting to one of the earlier talks and

4829
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:38,960
again not sure um if you saw it but just

4830
03:12:38,960 --> 03:12:40,880
to kind of recapitulate the point so

4831
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:43,840
this was from tim schneider's talk

4832
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:47,359
and tim spoke about goal-driven active

4833
03:12:47,359 --> 03:12:49,120
exploration so i'm sure that there would

4834
03:12:49,120 --> 03:12:51,920
be a lot of resonance there with the

4835
03:12:51,920 --> 03:12:52,800
um

4836
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:54,239
dual model

4837
03:12:54,239 --> 03:12:56,640
and one of the questions that he really

4838
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:58,880
highlighted was he asked can the

4839
03:12:58,880 --> 03:13:02,080
familiar have intrinsic value

4840
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:04,640
because he described this uh

4841
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:07,200
problem called the detachment problem

4842
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:10,319
where like a region of high

4843
03:13:10,319 --> 03:13:12,319
posterior likelihood a good region to be

4844
03:13:12,319 --> 03:13:13,040
in

4845
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:15,439
is getting walled off by like a

4846
03:13:15,439 --> 03:13:17,920
well-explored region and so that

4847
03:13:17,920 --> 03:13:20,479
dissuades further epistemically driven

4848
03:13:20,479 --> 03:13:23,120
actions into that kind of ring

4849
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:24,640
it's almost like we've already been

4850
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:26,399
there but then it's like

4851
03:13:26,399 --> 03:13:28,800
the you know the the new finding was

4852
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:31,520
just one more paper down that down that

4853
03:13:31,520 --> 03:13:35,439
bridge um yeah and then

4854
03:13:35,439 --> 03:13:38,479
we talk a lot in active inference about

4855
03:13:38,479 --> 03:13:40,960
morphological computation and body

4856
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:44,239
computation and i think in the setting

4857
03:13:44,239 --> 03:13:46,560
of the gas dissipating there are several

4858
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:49,200
ways like we can be really specific when

4859
03:13:49,200 --> 03:13:51,520
we're talking about applied embodied

4860
03:13:51,520 --> 03:13:53,760
computation so one was what you just

4861
03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:56,880
mentioned with the uavs and the fans and

4862
03:13:56,880 --> 03:13:59,920
how that was causing a distortion it

4863
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:02,319
wasn't just like a free-floating sensor

4864
03:14:02,319 --> 03:14:04,399
and that's like our own body models and

4865
03:14:04,399 --> 03:14:06,160
so people talk about how the body is a

4866
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:08,560
model and it has a model of itself in

4867
03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:11,200
space and that's how we can do all these

4868
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:13,439
actions um and then the second example

4869
03:14:13,439 --> 03:14:16,239
of like embodied and extended cognition

4870
03:14:16,239 --> 03:14:20,000
was the way that the gas was dissipating

4871
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,319
so it's almost like the forgetting in

4872
03:14:22,319 --> 03:14:25,359
the model was happening automatically

4873
03:14:25,359 --> 03:14:27,920
because you couldn't just build up

4874
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:29,520
a heat map

4875
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:32,160
of where of you know the integral of gas

4876
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:35,040
flowing through a region of time

4877
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:37,200
you have to have something that is

4878
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:39,840
dynamic but you're local

4879
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:41,359
searching a space

4880
03:14:41,359 --> 03:14:44,080
and so your estimate in other areas that

4881
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:46,720
are distal will become increasingly

4882
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:47,840
uncertain

4883
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:49,600
so yeah what does that make you think

4884
03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:51,279
about in terms of the work that you're

4885
03:14:51,279 --> 03:14:52,560
doing

4886
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:54,160
yeah all those things are very

4887
03:14:54,160 --> 03:14:56,080
interesting there are many directions

4888
03:14:56,080 --> 03:14:58,160
for that and we we think about it the

4889
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:00,239
work we're doing here is just try to

4890
03:15:00,239 --> 03:15:03,040
illustrate the very best principle about

4891
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:04,479
how to

4892
03:15:04,479 --> 03:15:07,840
take the advantage of the um the action

4893
03:15:07,840 --> 03:15:10,080
you take to give you the new information

4894
03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:12,080
and then from there to help you so this

4895
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:13,840
is basically as we talk about bear the

4896
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:16,479
same spirit as a active inference so

4897
03:15:16,479 --> 03:15:18,640
this is the fundamental things and in

4898
03:15:18,640 --> 03:15:21,040
terms of scenario and the complexity

4899
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:22,880
there are many many layers so we can add

4900
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:25,439
the things on and also one thing you

4901
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:27,920
mentioned about the uh

4902
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:30,560
for example the influence of the uh

4903
03:15:30,560 --> 03:15:32,960
the agent or the robot is dynamics but

4904
03:15:32,960 --> 03:15:35,279
also it could be for example we consider

4905
03:15:35,279 --> 03:15:38,000
a source now is in the in the stationary

4906
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,319
is fixed they are just released the gas

4907
03:15:40,319 --> 03:15:42,399
but in the real life maybe there is a

4908
03:15:42,399 --> 03:15:45,680
mobile and uh things that people some

4909
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:47,520
terrorists for example put something on

4910
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:49,520
the on the truck or on something the

4911
03:15:49,520 --> 03:15:52,239
driving around or some other uh

4912
03:15:52,239 --> 03:15:54,479
things could happen and there are also

4913
03:15:54,479 --> 03:15:56,160
people talk about uh intermittent

4914
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:58,080
release sometimes release and stop and

4915
03:15:58,080 --> 03:16:00,399
then release again so there are many uh

4916
03:16:00,399 --> 03:16:04,160
much more complicated scenarios here and

4917
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:06,960
could be very interesting um coupled

4918
03:16:06,960 --> 03:16:08,800
with some other things things people

4919
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:11,040
talk about for example you could have

4920
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:14,399
more than one uh sources in this

4921
03:16:14,399 --> 03:16:17,120
release and it's just not one single uh

4922
03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:19,520
sources could be have more than one and

4923
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:21,600
also people talk about if you have a

4924
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:23,680
larger area and you have a number of

4925
03:16:23,680 --> 03:16:26,080
agents try to work together now we talk

4926
03:16:26,080 --> 03:16:27,359
about the collaboration between the

4927
03:16:27,359 --> 03:16:29,279
different agencies how to work together

4928
03:16:29,279 --> 03:16:31,760
more efficiently to to

4929
03:16:31,760 --> 03:16:34,319
search the area so there are many many

4930
03:16:34,319 --> 03:16:36,880
things here and the one particular thing

4931
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:39,120
that i feel is directly can get from

4932
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:42,080
your the help from your communities now

4933
03:16:42,080 --> 03:16:43,520
we only look at a

4934
03:16:43,520 --> 03:16:46,399
one step ahead but in real life we

4935
03:16:46,399 --> 03:16:48,479
already have some similar if we look

4936
03:16:48,479 --> 03:16:50,239
five step ahead it actually give us a

4937
03:16:50,239 --> 03:16:52,479
much better result because you look

4938
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:54,720
further after the influence

4939
03:16:54,720 --> 03:16:57,200
of those changes so so there are but

4940
03:16:57,200 --> 03:16:59,840
however the the the the downside is uh

4941
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:01,600
we'll already talk about it is a about a

4942
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:03,760
computational load so now you have a

4943
03:17:03,760 --> 03:17:05,840
like a tree search because each step you

4944
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:07,520
have a number of directions you want to

4945
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:10,399
move your agents and you very many uh

4946
03:17:10,399 --> 03:17:12,800
multiple steps and the accumulation

4947
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:16,000
could be quite nasty and we now have a

4948
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:17,760
researcher trying to think about using a

4949
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:19,600
multi-colored research or similar kind

4950
03:17:19,600 --> 03:17:22,399
of and the car is also provide for

4951
03:17:22,399 --> 03:17:24,479
instance provide some idea about it and

4952
03:17:24,479 --> 03:17:27,840
you work in the area uh how can embedded

4953
03:17:27,840 --> 03:17:30,479
into uh our work and try to take the

4954
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:32,960
advantage of this so there are lots of

4955
03:17:32,960 --> 03:17:35,439
interesting things here

4956
03:17:35,439 --> 03:17:38,720
awesome i i'd like to um i think just to

4957
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:42,640
create a few of these points of contact

4958
03:17:42,640 --> 03:17:44,640
pick up where you said that you're

4959
03:17:44,640 --> 03:17:46,880
planning one step ahead

4960
03:17:46,880 --> 03:17:49,920
um which is analogous to the variational

4961
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:52,720
free energy it's like the instantaneous

4962
03:17:52,720 --> 03:17:55,200
best action

4963
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:56,960
and then the expected free energy takes

4964
03:17:56,960 --> 03:17:58,720
into the future and i wanted to mention

4965
03:17:58,720 --> 03:18:00,640
a few different ways that

4966
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:02,479
temporal planning is accomplished and

4967
03:18:02,479 --> 03:18:04,479
some were mentioned in the earlier

4968
03:18:04,479 --> 03:18:07,199
presentations

4969
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:09,600
also it's interesting to note that

4970
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:11,680
however many years ago i don't know the

4971
03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:14,479
exact number but somewhere in the 10

4972
03:18:14,479 --> 03:18:16,239
years ago range

4973
03:18:16,239 --> 03:18:18,000
active inference was kind of like an

4974
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,479
instantaneous perception cognition

4975
03:18:20,479 --> 03:18:23,600
action theory and several elaborations

4976
03:18:23,600 --> 03:18:26,160
have specifically enabled it to account

4977
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:26,960
for

4978
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:29,520
increasingly distal planning so one

4979
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:33,200
example is like in the continuous time

4980
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:34,560
setting

4981
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:37,920
having a taylor series approximation of

4982
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:40,399
the generalized coordinates of higher

4983
03:18:40,399 --> 03:18:41,680
and higher

4984
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:44,640
approximation depth is one approach

4985
03:18:44,640 --> 03:18:46,560
another approach that can happen in

4986
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:49,200
discrete time is having just a broader

4987
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:51,439
time horizon for policies

4988
03:18:51,439 --> 03:18:53,520
as well as with different uh tree

4989
03:18:53,520 --> 03:18:55,520
pruning approaches

4990
03:18:55,520 --> 03:18:58,160
another approach that can work with

4991
03:18:58,160 --> 03:19:00,479
discrete time or with hybrid models with

4992
03:19:00,479 --> 03:19:02,399
discrete and continuous time is

4993
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:05,200
hierarchical modeling yeah and so it's

4994
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:07,840
very interesting to wonder whether for

4995
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:10,160
planning a hundred steps out

4996
03:19:10,160 --> 03:19:12,880
to go to think really deep into how

4997
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:16,880
the uav will do something far away

4998
03:19:16,880 --> 03:19:18,479
how does it chunk that

4999
03:19:18,479 --> 03:19:20,399
and how does that chunking into is it a

5000
03:19:20,399 --> 03:19:23,120
hundred steps or one ten steps to ten

5001
03:19:23,120 --> 03:19:24,800
two steps of fifty and five of ten

5002
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:28,239
inside the way that it starts to chunk

5003
03:19:28,239 --> 03:19:29,920
and understands

5004
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:32,319
are the ways in which the computational

5005
03:19:32,319 --> 03:19:35,200
burden is reduced and also those ways

5006
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:37,600
that start to resemble the ways in which

5007
03:19:37,600 --> 03:19:39,840
biological cognitive entities also make

5008
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:42,560
sense of their environments

5009
03:19:42,560 --> 03:19:44,239
yeah i think that's absolutely right

5010
03:19:44,239 --> 03:19:45,760
that's a very good way to move forward

5011
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:47,359
we're also doing

5012
03:19:47,359 --> 03:19:48,880
some thinking this way but not

5013
03:19:48,880 --> 03:19:50,160
necessarily coming from the same

5014
03:19:50,160 --> 03:19:52,239
direction because we think about it for

5015
03:19:52,239 --> 03:19:54,960
example when you make a decision on on

5016
03:19:54,960 --> 03:19:56,160
the uh

5017
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:59,200
on the for example using the uh

5018
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:01,200
autumn search problem you somehow like

5019
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:03,359
you try to design your your way point

5020
03:20:03,359 --> 03:20:05,680
where you want to move to that and then

5021
03:20:05,680 --> 03:20:07,279
suddenly you have a question about how

5022
03:20:07,279 --> 03:20:09,520
far the step size this exactly can

5023
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:11,600
change and even the larger area maybe

5024
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:13,040
you want to move a little bit longer

5025
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:15,600
distance so somehow this is a you can

5026
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:17,120
regard this as a

5027
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:19,600
hierarchical uh strategy and then we

5028
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:21,600
actually uh give the commander to

5029
03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:24,800
low-level uav control or autopilot they

5030
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:27,200
try to follow those kind of things so

5031
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:28,720
there's a lot of things that we need to

5032
03:20:28,720 --> 03:20:30,160
think about that

5033
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:32,479
somehow like is trade-off between the

5034
03:20:32,479 --> 03:20:34,800
performance computation load and the

5035
03:20:34,800 --> 03:20:36,800
horizon you won't be looking ahead in

5036
03:20:36,800 --> 03:20:38,560
theory if you're longer it gives you

5037
03:20:38,560 --> 03:20:40,640
better performance but however how far

5038
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:42,880
you are able to looking at so there is a

5039
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:45,200
trade-off between those terms maybe four

5040
03:20:45,200 --> 03:20:46,479
different applications could have

5041
03:20:46,479 --> 03:20:47,359
different

5042
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:49,120
factors but the whole idea i think

5043
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:50,720
that's quite interesting

5044
03:20:50,720 --> 03:20:55,479
is exactly worth to explore

5045
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:57,359
cool um

5046
03:20:57,359 --> 03:20:58,160
we

5047
03:20:58,160 --> 03:21:01,040
have also kind of to to pick up on some

5048
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:02,640
similarities and differences with the

5049
03:21:02,640 --> 03:21:04,000
presentations

5050
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:07,840
some of them utilized neural networks

5051
03:21:07,840 --> 03:21:11,359
as modules in their training other used

5052
03:21:11,359 --> 03:21:14,000
variational bayesian methods

5053
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:16,479
which can be fit as an optimization

5054
03:21:16,479 --> 03:21:19,600
problem and also we saw sampling based

5055
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:22,319
approaches so i guess just pretty

5056
03:21:22,319 --> 03:21:24,880
broadly how do you see

5057
03:21:24,880 --> 03:21:28,080
these different ways of

5058
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:29,200
doing

5059
03:21:29,200 --> 03:21:31,600
robotics and edge computing

5060
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:33,680
how do you see them working

5061
03:21:33,680 --> 03:21:36,080
in different situations or together

5062
03:21:36,080 --> 03:21:36,880
with

5063
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:40,560
sort of pre-trained or updatable models

5064
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:42,800
that are large or variational or

5065
03:21:42,800 --> 03:21:45,520
sampling based approaches

5066
03:21:45,520 --> 03:21:47,200
yeah that's that's a very interesting

5067
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:49,439
topic and i was quite abroad and there

5068
03:21:49,439 --> 03:21:51,040
are

5069
03:21:51,040 --> 03:21:53,680
lot of research nowadays about using uh

5070
03:21:53,680 --> 03:21:55,520
pre-training the model and particularly

5071
03:21:55,520 --> 03:21:56,880
in the context of

5072
03:21:56,880 --> 03:21:58,880
reinforcement learning for example if

5073
03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:00,880
you learn things and then try to deploy

5074
03:22:00,880 --> 03:22:02,880
them in the real life particularly for

5075
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:05,120
the other robotics as well they have

5076
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:07,920
lots of research in the area and uh for

5077
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:10,399
me and as i didn't have any time to

5078
03:22:10,399 --> 03:22:13,359
explain uh articulate those ideas fully

5079
03:22:13,359 --> 03:22:15,760
but i think about it is lots of problems

5080
03:22:15,760 --> 03:22:17,200
and

5081
03:22:17,200 --> 03:22:19,439
whether it's engineering system robotics

5082
03:22:19,439 --> 03:22:22,880
or the biological or the the human is is

5083
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:25,520
however the the the city could be

5084
03:22:25,520 --> 03:22:28,880
described like in how to uh

5085
03:22:28,880 --> 03:22:31,680
like make a optimal division at any time

5086
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:33,359
the optimal division could in terms of

5087
03:22:33,359 --> 03:22:36,160
try to find a food or try to survive or

5088
03:22:36,160 --> 03:22:38,720
try to do something useful no matter so

5089
03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:40,560
that overall those all this problem in

5090
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:43,600
my view can be summarized as a optimal

5091
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:45,600
decision making problem

5092
03:22:45,600 --> 03:22:46,720
and

5093
03:22:46,720 --> 03:22:48,800
for this one even when you have all the

5094
03:22:48,800 --> 03:22:51,359
environment information unknown and also

5095
03:22:51,359 --> 03:22:53,680
all the behavior of your agents unknown

5096
03:22:53,680 --> 03:22:56,399
is not easy but when you try to deal

5097
03:22:56,399 --> 03:22:58,239
with something like what we talk about

5098
03:22:58,239 --> 03:23:00,239
is uh uncertainty in the environment on

5099
03:23:00,239 --> 03:23:02,239
the environment it will become much more

5100
03:23:02,239 --> 03:23:04,640
challenging so and uh

5101
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:07,279
there may be there's no time being no uh

5102
03:23:07,279 --> 03:23:09,760
like a single solution for this this is

5103
03:23:09,760 --> 03:23:11,680
why you talk about many different

5104
03:23:11,680 --> 03:23:13,760
approaches they try to deal with and the

5105
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:16,560
problem for me is um

5106
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:17,439
the

5107
03:23:17,439 --> 03:23:18,239
the

5108
03:23:18,239 --> 03:23:19,680
the

5109
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:22,319
uh there are two major uh approach i'm

5110
03:23:22,319 --> 03:23:25,520
thinking about it one is i call the uh

5111
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:28,160
iteration process the iteration process

5112
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:30,640
in particular like in the

5113
03:23:30,640 --> 03:23:33,279
reinforcement learning what it means you

5114
03:23:33,279 --> 03:23:37,439
have some initial strategy you try to

5115
03:23:37,439 --> 03:23:39,279
take the action from the environment and

5116
03:23:39,279 --> 03:23:41,040
reward the function or set the change

5117
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:43,120
you learn from that gradually somehow

5118
03:23:43,120 --> 03:23:46,319
like you make your uh policy uh or

5119
03:23:46,319 --> 03:23:49,279
or very function close to true truly the

5120
03:23:49,279 --> 03:23:51,279
optimal one option policy so you're

5121
03:23:51,279 --> 03:23:54,479
always doing that in uh in the in the

5122
03:23:54,479 --> 03:23:56,399
iteration learning learning learning so

5123
03:23:56,399 --> 03:23:59,359
this is a approach and uh and but

5124
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:01,279
because this approach you need a lot of

5125
03:24:01,279 --> 03:24:03,760
data this is why now people tend to

5126
03:24:03,760 --> 03:24:05,920
train in the data i train is australia

5127
03:24:05,920 --> 03:24:08,080
beforehand and let them deploy that

5128
03:24:08,080 --> 03:24:09,920
maybe online you can adapt to a little

5129
03:24:09,920 --> 03:24:12,160
bit to that but you if you can using

5130
03:24:12,160 --> 03:24:14,160
offline training using a lots of data to

5131
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:16,160
take the advantage

5132
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:17,920
but there another approach like maybe

5133
03:24:17,920 --> 03:24:20,080
more like in the uh

5134
03:24:20,080 --> 03:24:22,560
in active interference or more like in

5135
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:25,760
the due control i call it as a purely

5136
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:30,560
like a online optimization approach

5137
03:24:30,560 --> 03:24:32,640
the online optimization process just

5138
03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:35,120
like said okay giving all the scenarios

5139
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:37,359
giving all the information i have with

5140
03:24:37,359 --> 03:24:40,000
the about the environment giving all my

5141
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:43,200
what is my objective i try to work out

5142
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:46,080
what is the best strategy i should have

5143
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:48,720
given all the information i have and on

5144
03:24:48,720 --> 03:24:52,160
the body environment about my

5145
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:53,760
reward function

5146
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:55,760
i just try to work

5147
03:24:55,760 --> 03:24:56,479
out

5148
03:24:56,479 --> 03:24:58,080
what are the best strategies so then

5149
03:24:58,080 --> 03:25:00,399
this problem can formulate as an online

5150
03:25:00,399 --> 03:25:02,720
optimization program you try to say okay

5151
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:04,720
give all the information connect so far

5152
03:25:04,720 --> 03:25:06,640
i give all the understanding

5153
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:09,680
you charge it to that and uh

5154
03:25:09,680 --> 03:25:12,080
for this approach uh you need to have a

5155
03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:14,479
larger computational load normally as

5156
03:25:14,479 --> 03:25:17,040
you talk about aging computing and you

5157
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:18,880
this is why we struggle we talk about a

5158
03:25:18,880 --> 03:25:20,880
one step ahead because once never had

5159
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:22,800
these means is the optimization problem

5160
03:25:22,800 --> 03:25:24,399
easier to solve if you look at a

5161
03:25:24,399 --> 03:25:26,319
multiple state the optimization problem

5162
03:25:26,319 --> 03:25:28,560
could have getting much more complicated

5163
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:29,920
and aging computing maybe you're not

5164
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:33,040
good enough try to do it to do it but in

5165
03:25:33,040 --> 03:25:36,880
principle i can i regard itself as a as

5166
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:38,960
a two broader

5167
03:25:38,960 --> 03:25:41,200
approach to suggest that and in the

5168
03:25:41,200 --> 03:25:44,000
inactive inference this is precisely you

5169
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:46,560
tried using free energy or expected free

5170
03:25:46,560 --> 03:25:48,560
energy as a reward function you had

5171
03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:49,600
optimal

5172
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:51,840
optimize your action so to give you the

5173
03:25:51,840 --> 03:25:54,560
best possible one so so this is why i

5174
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:56,720
feel is this kind of a similar kind of

5175
03:25:56,720 --> 03:26:00,160
approach as we talk about it

5176
03:26:01,359 --> 03:26:03,680
so i i was also

5177
03:26:03,680 --> 03:26:05,040
while you

5178
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:06,880
spoke to the dual control systems

5179
03:26:06,880 --> 03:26:08,319
thinking about

5180
03:26:08,319 --> 03:26:11,359
how it might have formal differences

5181
03:26:11,359 --> 03:26:13,439
from free energy principle and active

5182
03:26:13,439 --> 03:26:15,680
inference as we know it today

5183
03:26:15,680 --> 03:26:18,560
or again like we discussed earlier how

5184
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:20,640
it might have reached some of the same

5185
03:26:20,640 --> 03:26:23,120
points from two different angles

5186
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:25,520
and it made me think about the

5187
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:27,680
particular partition

5188
03:26:27,680 --> 03:26:30,479
and the markov blanket or the first in

5189
03:26:30,479 --> 03:26:32,640
blanket so do you have any thoughts on

5190
03:26:32,640 --> 03:26:34,319
this or i can provide any more context

5191
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:36,399
but first i just wanted to ask you

5192
03:26:36,399 --> 03:26:37,439
if

5193
03:26:37,439 --> 03:26:40,479
the concept of blankets

5194
03:26:40,479 --> 03:26:43,600
was relevant or there was some analog in

5195
03:26:43,600 --> 03:26:45,279
the control literature from your

5196
03:26:45,279 --> 03:26:47,120
perspective

5197
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:48,560
yes we we

5198
03:26:48,560 --> 03:26:50,640
maybe we can say we always do that in

5199
03:26:50,640 --> 03:26:52,319
our control community

5200
03:26:52,319 --> 03:26:54,160
so we always do that in the sense

5201
03:26:54,160 --> 03:26:57,359
traditional m control look at is our own

5202
03:26:57,359 --> 03:27:00,160
dynamics itself and the sensor try to

5203
03:27:00,160 --> 03:27:02,720
pick up the information then the action

5204
03:27:02,720 --> 03:27:03,760
will take

5205
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:05,840
so this is a controlled way the sensor

5206
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:08,160
and your own thing and then take the x

5207
03:27:08,160 --> 03:27:10,239
but however previously control we very

5208
03:27:10,239 --> 03:27:11,439
much like

5209
03:27:11,439 --> 03:27:15,359
ignore the the interaction with the uh

5210
03:27:15,359 --> 03:27:16,800
too much of body environment we talk

5211
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:17,920
about environment in the control

5212
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:20,239
typically we call that disturbance

5213
03:27:20,239 --> 03:27:22,399
so the aim of our control system when we

5214
03:27:22,399 --> 03:27:25,680
are existing is try to act against any

5215
03:27:25,680 --> 03:27:28,880
uh disturbance because we try to uh to

5216
03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:30,560
do something ourselves

5217
03:27:30,560 --> 03:27:32,560
or keep it for example if you think

5218
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:34,560
about want to keep your room at

5219
03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:36,399
temperature at a third degree if some

5220
03:27:36,399 --> 03:27:38,560
open door is a little if the external

5221
03:27:38,560 --> 03:27:40,399
temperature changes all those our

5222
03:27:40,399 --> 03:27:42,080
control is somehow like i don't care

5223
03:27:42,080 --> 03:27:44,160
about anything outside i care about it

5224
03:27:44,160 --> 03:27:46,720
sensors take information i do something

5225
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:49,120
under them i take the action so this is

5226
03:27:49,120 --> 03:27:51,439
always regarded the water is

5227
03:27:51,439 --> 03:27:53,680
information from the sensor and we take

5228
03:27:53,680 --> 03:27:55,520
the action which will have some

5229
03:27:55,520 --> 03:27:57,040
influence outside then we take the

5230
03:27:57,040 --> 03:27:59,040
information from the sensor so whenever

5231
03:27:59,040 --> 03:28:00,720
i think that michael blanken i found

5232
03:28:00,720 --> 03:28:04,640
that there's a natural and maybe some

5233
03:28:04,640 --> 03:28:06,319
somebody close somebody with some

5234
03:28:06,319 --> 03:28:09,200
thinking we we have i feel this is quite

5235
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:11,520
interesting the way to looking at the

5236
03:28:11,520 --> 03:28:13,200
world and because of you that you in

5237
03:28:13,200 --> 03:28:14,560
this way you don't care about it in

5238
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:16,239
someone open the door don't open the

5239
03:28:16,239 --> 03:28:18,080
door you don't know because you just say

5240
03:28:18,080 --> 03:28:20,000
from the sensor what's the temperature

5241
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:22,319
changing and we we take this

5242
03:28:22,319 --> 03:28:26,560
ignore anything outside that

5243
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:29,840
i'm glad you added that because i also

5244
03:28:29,840 --> 03:28:34,000
had wondered whether the control

5245
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:35,359
loop

5246
03:28:35,359 --> 03:28:36,840
was like a

5247
03:28:36,840 --> 03:28:40,720
pretty active partition i mean input

5248
03:28:40,720 --> 03:28:44,000
output systems systems with interfaces

5249
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:46,239
holographic systems more and more

5250
03:28:46,239 --> 03:28:48,399
equivalences have been found but it's

5251
03:28:48,399 --> 03:28:50,880
kind of like the sparsest representation

5252
03:28:50,880 --> 03:28:53,359
of interaction between two agents or

5253
03:28:53,359 --> 03:28:55,840
with an agent in a niche is like well

5254
03:28:55,840 --> 03:28:57,920
you know you need the road going one way

5255
03:28:57,920 --> 03:28:59,279
and you need the road going the other

5256
03:28:59,279 --> 03:29:01,439
way otherwise it's not like you haven't

5257
03:29:01,439 --> 03:29:03,520
closed the loop so you have those four

5258
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:05,200
pieces like the two entities and the

5259
03:29:05,200 --> 03:29:06,560
edges

5260
03:29:06,560 --> 03:29:09,760
and then it is interesting with the way

5261
03:29:09,760 --> 03:29:12,720
that what comes from the environment is

5262
03:29:12,720 --> 03:29:15,439
described is it a perturbation or

5263
03:29:15,439 --> 03:29:17,359
disturbance something that should be

5264
03:29:17,359 --> 03:29:18,720
controlled

5265
03:29:18,720 --> 03:29:19,680
or

5266
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:22,640
as the case with allostasis and like

5267
03:29:22,640 --> 03:29:24,000
biological

5268
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:26,560
processes that are anticipatory

5269
03:29:26,560 --> 03:29:28,720
and then going all the way into like

5270
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:30,800
novelty which is like the ultimate

5271
03:29:30,800 --> 03:29:32,239
anticipation

5272
03:29:32,239 --> 03:29:34,560
it's just anticipation of the different

5273
03:29:34,560 --> 03:29:36,960
and then it's like again paralleling the

5274
03:29:36,960 --> 03:29:39,120
development of industrial control

5275
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:41,680
systems going from stabilizing

5276
03:29:41,680 --> 03:29:43,120
vibration

5277
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:46,000
yeah into needing to be proactive

5278
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:48,720
there's also again a natural coming

5279
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:49,760
together

5280
03:29:49,760 --> 03:29:52,319
as the attention in these fields turned

5281
03:29:52,319 --> 03:29:53,520
to

5282
03:29:53,520 --> 03:29:56,640
finding formal cognitive models

5283
03:29:56,640 --> 03:29:59,920
yeah yeah absolutely i think that

5284
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:01,760
the the principle of the market uh

5285
03:30:01,760 --> 03:30:03,560
branch i think i quite found quite

5286
03:30:03,560 --> 03:30:06,880
interesting relevant um but they are the

5287
03:30:06,880 --> 03:30:08,880
the big difference from traditional and

5288
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:10,800
uranic cultural thinking to what are

5289
03:30:10,800 --> 03:30:13,040
thinking in your area or a current our

5290
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:15,840
thinking is about how to represent the

5291
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:18,239
environment in your brain

5292
03:30:18,239 --> 03:30:20,800
so how you try to say this is that make

5293
03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:22,720
the all the whole things different

5294
03:30:22,720 --> 03:30:23,680
because

5295
03:30:23,680 --> 03:30:25,279
as i said previously maybe you don't

5296
03:30:25,279 --> 03:30:26,880
care too much everything like today the

5297
03:30:26,880 --> 03:30:29,520
disturbance or are just interesting

5298
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:30,720
that your

5299
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:33,200
heating system another and now is

5300
03:30:33,200 --> 03:30:36,319
actually no i want to have some way to

5301
03:30:36,319 --> 03:30:37,680
if you want to anticipate something

5302
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:39,120
happen it may have a better

5303
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:40,960
implementation about the environment and

5304
03:30:40,960 --> 03:30:43,520
also you want to align your belief of or

5305
03:30:43,520 --> 03:30:46,000
inside state more close to external

5306
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:48,800
state so that is where i think all the

5307
03:30:48,800 --> 03:30:51,279
city things comes and also where you are

5308
03:30:51,279 --> 03:30:53,680
able to make some high-level division

5309
03:30:53,680 --> 03:30:54,640
make a

5310
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:56,640
where the intelligence come from because

5311
03:30:56,640 --> 03:30:58,560
you have better implementation about

5312
03:30:58,560 --> 03:31:00,560
that you can figure out a better way how

5313
03:31:00,560 --> 03:31:03,040
to do it and then how to get the benefit

5314
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:06,479
from the environment

5315
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:07,680
so

5316
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:10,160
one example that made me think of and

5317
03:31:10,160 --> 03:31:12,239
also connecting back to the embodied

5318
03:31:12,239 --> 03:31:13,760
intelligence and the morphological

5319
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:16,720
computing i remember seeing a

5320
03:31:16,720 --> 03:31:18,960
a robot or a little vehicle

5321
03:31:18,960 --> 03:31:22,080
and it was able to move over a surface

5322
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:24,160
that looked kind of like a stair on its

5323
03:31:24,160 --> 03:31:27,040
side like it was just very jagged um

5324
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:30,640
but the wheel that this machine had was

5325
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:32,800
shaped like a square that was the right

5326
03:31:32,800 --> 03:31:35,520
radius so basically it was able to roll

5327
03:31:35,520 --> 03:31:37,920
perfectly smoothly across that one

5328
03:31:37,920 --> 03:31:39,840
frequency of stair

5329
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:41,200
but a different frequency of stair it

5330
03:31:41,200 --> 03:31:44,319
would have just been a total

5331
03:31:44,640 --> 03:31:48,960
total bumpy ride um yeah so

5332
03:31:49,120 --> 03:31:52,399
if the wheel would have been small

5333
03:31:52,399 --> 03:31:54,479
then there would have been a debate

5334
03:31:54,479 --> 03:31:56,479
around well should we represent chunks

5335
03:31:56,479 --> 03:31:58,479
of stairs and up and down hill and all

5336
03:31:58,479 --> 03:32:00,560
that fine scale but then

5337
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:02,640
when the morphology

5338
03:32:02,640 --> 03:32:04,800
is fit to the niche

5339
03:32:04,800 --> 03:32:06,800
in a way that's natural

5340
03:32:06,800 --> 03:32:09,600
or in a way that is off sourcing some of

5341
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:11,279
the computation

5342
03:32:11,279 --> 03:32:13,200
to the physicality

5343
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:14,640
then that

5344
03:32:14,640 --> 03:32:16,319
entity only needs to consider like a

5345
03:32:16,319 --> 03:32:18,399
linear movement as if it was like in a

5346
03:32:18,399 --> 03:32:19,920
simpler space

5347
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:22,720
yeah and so then it's almost interesting

5348
03:32:22,720 --> 03:32:24,880
to ask um like in some of the

5349
03:32:24,880 --> 03:32:26,880
presentations they they used

5350
03:32:26,880 --> 03:32:30,399
um very standardized robotics platforms

5351
03:32:30,399 --> 03:32:33,359
like the quadcopter and the turtlebot

5352
03:32:33,359 --> 03:32:36,000
and other standard

5353
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:38,080
to the extent i understand standardized

5354
03:32:38,080 --> 03:32:40,080
robotic hardware which is awesome

5355
03:32:40,080 --> 03:32:42,640
because it increases accessibility and

5356
03:32:42,640 --> 03:32:44,720
it demonstrates it in a clear way like

5357
03:32:44,720 --> 03:32:47,359
tomorrow we'll hear from legos

5358
03:32:47,359 --> 03:32:48,840
implementations and so

5359
03:32:48,840 --> 03:32:50,319
on um

5360
03:32:50,319 --> 03:32:52,000
but then that

5361
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:55,200
element of embodied computation

5362
03:32:55,200 --> 03:32:57,040
starts to

5363
03:32:57,040 --> 03:32:58,960
show how we could almost work in a

5364
03:32:58,960 --> 03:33:00,080
different way

5365
03:33:00,080 --> 03:33:02,840
and ask what kinds of

5366
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:06,080
systems could implement

5367
03:33:06,080 --> 03:33:08,080
certain functions

5368
03:33:08,080 --> 03:33:10,880
maybe there are shapes of

5369
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:14,160
robots or other objects that we we just

5370
03:33:14,160 --> 03:33:16,239
haven't seen the shape yet they don't

5371
03:33:16,239 --> 03:33:17,760
have to have two legs they don't need to

5372
03:33:17,760 --> 03:33:18,640
be

5373
03:33:18,640 --> 03:33:20,319
five feet tall

5374
03:33:20,319 --> 03:33:22,479
they don't need to look like a trash can

5375
03:33:22,479 --> 03:33:25,439
like that's some of the morphologies but

5376
03:33:25,439 --> 03:33:27,760
then with the air and the water and the

5377
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:30,720
ground there's so many bodies

5378
03:33:30,720 --> 03:33:32,399
just of insects

5379
03:33:32,399 --> 03:33:34,399
so yeah it's it's going to be really

5380
03:33:34,399 --> 03:33:36,640
amazing to see how this is used

5381
03:33:36,640 --> 03:33:39,120
proactively to design morphologies and

5382
03:33:39,120 --> 03:33:41,359
behaviors that just do things we haven't

5383
03:33:41,359 --> 03:33:42,399
seen

5384
03:33:42,399 --> 03:33:43,840
yeah yeah yeah absolutely right i think

5385
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:46,960
your abs are right yeah and

5386
03:33:46,960 --> 03:33:49,200
in this kind of uh i think maybe people

5387
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:51,359
call uh

5388
03:33:51,359 --> 03:33:53,840
the the fitness thrive somehow like this

5389
03:33:53,840 --> 03:33:55,920
and that is actually somehow like we

5390
03:33:55,920 --> 03:33:57,680
always maybe you can using free energy

5391
03:33:57,680 --> 03:34:00,399
or some other notion to describe because

5392
03:34:00,399 --> 03:34:02,160
you you're living the environment you

5393
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:05,120
want to get the best out of that and we

5394
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:07,120
talk about now is a strategy how to do

5395
03:34:07,120 --> 03:34:08,800
it or how to

5396
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:10,560
but however in the natural world because

5397
03:34:10,560 --> 03:34:12,319
you're physically uh

5398
03:34:12,319 --> 03:34:14,960
happier you your things are gradually

5399
03:34:14,960 --> 03:34:17,760
involved with you and if we are in our

5400
03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:20,000
design we can choose those physical body

5401
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:22,640
as always as options as something we are

5402
03:34:22,640 --> 03:34:24,880
able to change and maybe gradually can

5403
03:34:24,880 --> 03:34:27,200
combine those two things together it's

5404
03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:29,279
not only your brain to make the best

5405
03:34:29,279 --> 03:34:31,760
strategy but also you are maybe called

5406
03:34:31,760 --> 03:34:33,680
the actuators or your physical bodies

5407
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:35,600
other things you are gradually will

5408
03:34:35,600 --> 03:34:38,239
change with that so this is about how

5409
03:34:38,239 --> 03:34:41,120
you i feel how to set up the problem but

5410
03:34:41,120 --> 03:34:43,520
what i feel much more interesting is uh

5411
03:34:43,520 --> 03:34:45,279
in the active ingredients when you're

5412
03:34:45,279 --> 03:34:48,399
using free energy and then you can try

5413
03:34:48,399 --> 03:34:51,040
to capture much broader kind of behavior

5414
03:34:51,040 --> 03:34:53,520
and as i said in the control area we now

5415
03:34:53,520 --> 03:34:54,560
is

5416
03:34:54,560 --> 03:34:57,040
maybe more focus on the specific task

5417
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:59,040
specific mission this is what we do

5418
03:34:59,040 --> 03:35:01,040
physically we want to do it but however

5419
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:03,359
a lot of things like uh soft skills and

5420
03:35:03,359 --> 03:35:06,960
like more uh uh broadly about like our

5421
03:35:06,960 --> 03:35:09,760
confidence or a capability we don't talk

5422
03:35:09,760 --> 03:35:12,000
about it but human when we do the things

5423
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:14,399
we learn learn build up the confidence

5424
03:35:14,399 --> 03:35:17,040
or embody our skills and then we do more

5425
03:35:17,040 --> 03:35:19,520
things now this is a and i think this is

5426
03:35:19,520 --> 03:35:22,479
a things happening there and active

5427
03:35:22,479 --> 03:35:25,200
embarrassing able to explain that they

5428
03:35:25,200 --> 03:35:28,479
able to have a true framework to do this

5429
03:35:28,479 --> 03:35:30,640
we are maybe at a more on the physical

5430
03:35:30,640 --> 03:35:32,640
alignment so i can see things that

5431
03:35:32,640 --> 03:35:35,040
gradually can move together and you may

5432
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:37,680
can make robots for example more capable

5433
03:35:37,680 --> 03:35:40,720
to do something if they have the ability

5434
03:35:40,720 --> 03:35:42,800
to change their borders or change their

5435
03:35:42,800 --> 03:35:45,120
activation change other things or even

5436
03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:46,560
maybe they have come

5437
03:35:46,560 --> 03:35:48,399
improve their sensing because there's

5438
03:35:48,399 --> 03:35:51,120
something greater they learn and

5439
03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:52,800
they found more important than other

5440
03:35:52,800 --> 03:35:54,960
sensing particular environment they will

5441
03:35:54,960 --> 03:35:56,479
try to more develop

5442
03:35:56,479 --> 03:35:57,760
that kind of particular sensing

5443
03:35:57,760 --> 03:35:59,279
capability

5444
03:35:59,279 --> 03:36:02,000
so i can see that naturally and but the

5445
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:04,080
question is about how to set up the

5446
03:36:04,080 --> 03:36:06,720
problem we allowed it to make this

5447
03:36:06,720 --> 03:36:08,800
happen

5448
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:09,600
well

5449
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:10,560
um

5450
03:36:10,560 --> 03:36:12,560
one fragment that kind of

5451
03:36:12,560 --> 03:36:15,279
that reminded me of from my own area of

5452
03:36:15,279 --> 03:36:18,000
insect behavioral modeling is there are

5453
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:20,880
many models of task performance like

5454
03:36:20,880 --> 03:36:23,200
digging or foraging however there are

5455
03:36:23,200 --> 03:36:25,520
fewer models that are describing task

5456
03:36:25,520 --> 03:36:27,040
transitions

5457
03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:28,479
even though those are really important

5458
03:36:28,479 --> 03:36:30,880
for the colony and then the models of

5459
03:36:30,880 --> 03:36:32,800
task transitions tend to be more

5460
03:36:32,800 --> 03:36:34,800
generalized dynamical simulations and

5461
03:36:34,800 --> 03:36:36,160
less getting into the kind of

5462
03:36:36,160 --> 03:36:39,520
agent-based modeling perspective

5463
03:36:39,520 --> 03:36:41,520
and so it's like

5464
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:44,800
as we're seeing robotics with the

5465
03:36:44,800 --> 03:36:47,520
physicality and the technology pushing

5466
03:36:47,520 --> 03:36:49,279
the frontier

5467
03:36:49,279 --> 03:36:51,439
that kind of task switching becomes

5468
03:36:51,439 --> 03:36:53,680
important higher and higher orders and

5469
03:36:53,680 --> 03:36:55,279
then again that

5470
03:36:55,279 --> 03:36:59,120
brings us into the bio-inspired design

5471
03:36:59,120 --> 03:37:01,520
conversation because task switching is

5472
03:37:01,520 --> 03:37:03,040
so essential

5473
03:37:03,040 --> 03:37:04,640
and the idea that like

5474
03:37:04,640 --> 03:37:07,680
the human is this unfolding of memory

5475
03:37:07,680 --> 03:37:10,239
and anticipation and all of these

5476
03:37:10,239 --> 03:37:11,760
different features

5477
03:37:11,760 --> 03:37:13,120
and

5478
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:14,640
it's hard

5479
03:37:14,640 --> 03:37:17,200
functionally or neuroanatomically to

5480
03:37:17,200 --> 03:37:18,800
separate out

5481
03:37:18,800 --> 03:37:19,600
how

5482
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:22,640
the human brain works and how animal

5483
03:37:22,640 --> 03:37:24,800
nervous systems work

5484
03:37:24,800 --> 03:37:27,359
and so i think that'll be another

5485
03:37:27,359 --> 03:37:29,040
interesting area with this tension

5486
03:37:29,040 --> 03:37:31,760
between explainability

5487
03:37:31,760 --> 03:37:32,720
and

5488
03:37:32,720 --> 03:37:36,720
potentially even austerity of the models

5489
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:39,439
in that they'll have parameters

5490
03:37:39,439 --> 03:37:41,200
but the parameters

5491
03:37:41,200 --> 03:37:43,520
in the way they interact even for a few

5492
03:37:43,520 --> 03:37:45,439
parameter model

5493
03:37:45,439 --> 03:37:46,720
might be

5494
03:37:46,720 --> 03:37:48,479
difficult to understand because it's not

5495
03:37:48,479 --> 03:37:50,399
like going to be all the information is

5496
03:37:50,399 --> 03:37:52,479
in those generative model parameters

5497
03:37:52,479 --> 03:37:55,120
it's going to be those model parameters

5498
03:37:55,120 --> 03:37:57,600
and the dynamics of how gas is in the

5499
03:37:57,600 --> 03:38:00,479
world that are sort of relied upon

5500
03:38:00,479 --> 03:38:01,600
like

5501
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:03,840
outside of the focus like the the

5502
03:38:03,840 --> 03:38:06,479
background context for the model

5503
03:38:06,479 --> 03:38:09,760
so the model itself won't be fully

5504
03:38:09,760 --> 03:38:11,680
understandable or explainable because

5505
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:13,279
it's going to rely on this context just

5506
03:38:13,279 --> 03:38:16,239
like no sentence can stand alone so

5507
03:38:16,239 --> 03:38:18,399
there's just so many interesting

5508
03:38:18,399 --> 03:38:20,800
areas and and um

5509
03:38:20,800 --> 03:38:23,600
to see that the directions that

5510
03:38:23,600 --> 03:38:26,479
different fields can meet at and then

5511
03:38:26,479 --> 03:38:28,960
start to structure a productive

5512
03:38:28,960 --> 03:38:30,399
relationship

5513
03:38:30,399 --> 03:38:32,560
yeah

5514
03:38:32,560 --> 03:38:34,800
that's that's absolutely right and uh i

5515
03:38:34,800 --> 03:38:36,319
think i also

5516
03:38:36,319 --> 03:38:38,000
absolutely agree with you

5517
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:39,439
it's about the

5518
03:38:39,439 --> 03:38:41,920
the importance of models they in many

5519
03:38:41,920 --> 03:38:44,160
ways they are very very important for us

5520
03:38:44,160 --> 03:38:46,800
we quite we i knew that in the machine

5521
03:38:46,800 --> 03:38:48,399
learning area they have a model-based

5522
03:38:48,399 --> 03:38:50,479
approach and a model-free approach i'm

5523
03:38:50,479 --> 03:38:52,720
more biased to model-based approach

5524
03:38:52,720 --> 03:38:55,040
because um you can using um

5525
03:38:55,040 --> 03:38:56,800
like a model-free approach they are

5526
03:38:56,800 --> 03:38:59,520
quite powerful in some ways but however

5527
03:38:59,520 --> 03:39:01,199
maybe they suffer some issues you

5528
03:39:01,199 --> 03:39:04,399
already uh highlight how to explain this

5529
03:39:04,399 --> 03:39:05,359
uh to

5530
03:39:05,359 --> 03:39:07,199
why you make this kind of deletion why

5531
03:39:07,199 --> 03:39:08,880
take this kind of action and more

5532
03:39:08,880 --> 03:39:11,439
explainable and and furthermore the best

5533
03:39:11,439 --> 03:39:13,279
one because a lot of things we are doing

5534
03:39:13,279 --> 03:39:15,359
and particularly in our area there are

5535
03:39:15,359 --> 03:39:17,040
engineering systems they are have a

5536
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:19,600
first principle or other models already

5537
03:39:19,600 --> 03:39:22,000
they are for many years but however is

5538
03:39:22,000 --> 03:39:24,640
now is the question is about how to make

5539
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:27,920
a use of that and so i prefer modal uh

5540
03:39:27,920 --> 03:39:29,439
based approach in

5541
03:39:29,439 --> 03:39:31,040
many ways along

5542
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:33,279
for the explanation and try to you can

5543
03:39:33,279 --> 03:39:35,359
either understand the action but also

5544
03:39:35,359 --> 03:39:38,560
for the uh i call that um

5545
03:39:38,560 --> 03:39:39,760
somewhere like

5546
03:39:39,760 --> 03:39:42,000
maybe people yeah use the word sampling

5547
03:39:42,000 --> 03:39:44,160
efficiency somehow like you can use in

5548
03:39:44,160 --> 03:39:46,399
less data because you have a model based

5549
03:39:46,399 --> 03:39:49,040
approach and in the in our engineering

5550
03:39:49,040 --> 03:39:51,760
award that data means money

5551
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:52,640
and then

5552
03:39:52,640 --> 03:39:54,239
i knew a lot of people say okay the

5553
03:39:54,239 --> 03:39:56,319
google facebook can harvest

5554
03:39:56,319 --> 03:39:58,319
billions of data online freelance but

5555
03:39:58,319 --> 03:39:59,680
however in the engineering if you want

5556
03:39:59,680 --> 03:40:01,760
to do something you need to experiment

5557
03:40:01,760 --> 03:40:03,680
to test you if you're into physical

5558
03:40:03,680 --> 03:40:06,000
wrong something to get a useful uh data

5559
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:08,000
come out from that so that isn't the

5560
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:10,000
money so when we're using the model

5561
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:12,479
based approach is much more efficient in

5562
03:40:12,479 --> 03:40:13,920
terms of learning understanding what's

5563
03:40:13,920 --> 03:40:16,160
happening around the environment and so

5564
03:40:16,160 --> 03:40:17,760
this is why

5565
03:40:17,760 --> 03:40:19,199
economically

5566
03:40:19,199 --> 03:40:22,399
i feel is quite important for this not

5567
03:40:22,399 --> 03:40:24,640
just for the yeah so for for the safety

5568
03:40:24,640 --> 03:40:26,880
or how to make it more explainable but

5569
03:40:26,880 --> 03:40:29,680
there are some other reasons

5570
03:40:29,680 --> 03:40:32,640
well very interesting is there any other

5571
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:34,960
remarks you'd like to add or questions

5572
03:40:34,960 --> 03:40:37,359
you'd like to raise

5573
03:40:37,359 --> 03:40:39,439
uh not really i think that's really a

5574
03:40:39,439 --> 03:40:41,840
very good accommodation i i'm very

5575
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:44,160
pleased about this community as i said

5576
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:46,640
and it's a surprise for me and people

5577
03:40:46,640 --> 03:40:48,560
share the same idea so what i'm

5578
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:50,640
interesting is and they is getting more

5579
03:40:50,640 --> 03:40:52,319
involved in the primary community and

5580
03:40:52,319 --> 03:40:54,720
also i would like to open the door if

5581
03:40:54,720 --> 03:40:57,359
anyone working in this community they

5582
03:40:57,359 --> 03:40:58,960
want to talk with us want to work

5583
03:40:58,960 --> 03:41:01,439
together and develop some new ideas as

5584
03:41:01,439 --> 03:41:03,279
we already discussed and they're more

5585
03:41:03,279 --> 03:41:06,000
than welcome and you could have my

5586
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:08,880
contact under them try to talk with me

5587
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:11,359
and so basically i think we

5588
03:41:11,359 --> 03:41:13,199
share a lot of

5589
03:41:13,199 --> 03:41:16,800
fundamental ideas and we and also there

5590
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:17,920
are some

5591
03:41:17,920 --> 03:41:19,680
different tools uh different slides

5592
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:21,680
different concepts and approach if we

5593
03:41:21,680 --> 03:41:23,600
are able to work it together i will

5594
03:41:23,600 --> 03:41:26,080
think about we make them not only as the

5595
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:29,120
tools try to interpret how the

5596
03:41:29,120 --> 03:41:31,520
natural water and the human or animal

5597
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:34,160
the behavior like how but also make it

5598
03:41:34,160 --> 03:41:36,640
as a useful tool to drive us like this

5599
03:41:36,640 --> 03:41:39,680
theme to design more capable robotics

5600
03:41:39,680 --> 03:41:43,840
and do something for the society

5601
03:41:44,640 --> 03:41:45,760
amazing

5602
03:41:45,760 --> 03:41:48,960
great okay close to the first session so

5603
03:41:48,960 --> 03:41:50,479
you can depart

5604
03:41:50,479 --> 03:41:53,119
okay thank you

5605
03:41:54,840 --> 03:41:58,479
wow what a great discussion

5606
03:41:58,479 --> 03:42:01,199
big appreciation to professor chen for

5607
03:42:01,199 --> 03:42:02,880
joining for that

5608
03:42:02,880 --> 03:42:04,000
well

5609
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:06,239
that concludes the first

5610
03:42:06,239 --> 03:42:08,800
interval of the second applied active

5611
03:42:08,800 --> 03:42:12,640
inference symposium on july 31st

5612
03:42:12,640 --> 03:42:15,680
or at least it is now where i am

5613
03:42:15,680 --> 03:42:16,720
and

5614
03:42:16,720 --> 03:42:20,000
in about eight hours we're going to have

5615
03:42:20,000 --> 03:42:21,840
the second interval

5616
03:42:21,840 --> 03:42:24,239
it will feature presentations by bruno

5617
03:42:24,239 --> 03:42:27,439
lara matt brown adam saffron and jf

5618
03:42:27,439 --> 03:42:28,800
claudia

5619
03:42:28,800 --> 03:42:30,560
it should be a great set of

5620
03:42:30,560 --> 03:42:33,279
presentations followed by a round table

5621
03:42:33,279 --> 03:42:35,199
discussion featuring several of those

5622
03:42:35,199 --> 03:42:38,720
presenters as well as carl firsten so

5623
03:42:38,720 --> 03:42:41,520
hope everybody has a good break

5624
03:42:41,520 --> 03:42:43,279
in the eight hours before the second

5625
03:42:43,279 --> 03:42:45,040
interval and

5626
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:47,439
prepare some thoughts and questions and

5627
03:42:47,439 --> 03:42:49,680
writes them in the live chat or emails

5628
03:42:49,680 --> 03:42:50,800
us

5629
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:53,279
really appreciate you spending the time

5630
03:42:53,279 --> 03:42:54,640
and attention

5631
03:42:54,640 --> 03:42:56,640
listening to this active inference

5632
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:59,680
institute symposium and hope that you'll

5633
03:42:59,680 --> 03:43:02,720
stay involved participate and

5634
03:43:02,720 --> 03:43:04,800
keep on acting

5635
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:06,640
and inferring so

5636
03:43:06,640 --> 03:43:08,640
goodbye everyone and see you in the

5637
03:43:08,640 --> 03:43:11,960
second interval

5638
03:43:32,640 --> 03:43:34,720
you
