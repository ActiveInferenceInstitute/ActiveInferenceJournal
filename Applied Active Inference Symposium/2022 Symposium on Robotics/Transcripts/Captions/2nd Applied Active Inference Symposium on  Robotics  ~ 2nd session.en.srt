00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,240
all right hello and welcome everyone

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,040
welcome back to the second applied

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
active inference symposium it is the

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,239
second interval and it's july 31st 2022

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,160
in this second session

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,079
we are going to first feature a

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,399
presentation by bruno lara prediction

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
error dynamics a proof of concept

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,239
implementation

12
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
following that we'll hear from matt

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,360
brown

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,600
with a presentation real-time robotic

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
control through embodied homeostatic

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
feedback

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
the third presentation will be by adam

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,559
saffron on generalized simultaneous

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
localization and mapping gslam as a

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
unification framework for natural and

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
artificial intelligences and the final

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,439
presentation will be by jf klochter

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,759
towards a symbolic implementation of

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,479
active inference for lego robots we'll

25
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
then have some of those presenters

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,520
rejoin us in the final two or so hours

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
of this interval for a round table

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,159
discussion we'll also be joined by carl

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,960
first and there so thanks everyone for

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
watching live or in replay hope that you

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
add any comments

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,759
if you would like into the live chat

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,640
and

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
otherwise thanks to all of our

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
presenters and co-organizers for their

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
awesome work

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
and thanks so much for joining bruno

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
please take it away

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,759
yeah thanks a lot

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,840
for the invitation um

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
i was very surprised uh as as most of

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
our work so far

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
it's not directly related um

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
well it's not actually active inference

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
of course it's related

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,038
um

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,760
but um since we published a couple of

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
years ago

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,599
a paper well a paper that actually i'm

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,400
pre i'm presenting a bit of this results

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,280
here

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
um

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
well lots of lots of nice and

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
interesting people started to look into

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
this this implementation of of

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
prediction aerodynamics and it's

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,160
actually

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
the the part where

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,440
where um we could say it's a part that

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,879
we are taking out of all this framework

61
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,760
um to try to implement in our in our

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,400
robots in our agents

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
um

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
for for

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
i don't i i i don't know how much or how

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
many times you've heard this story of of

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,519
why we are doing this kind of

68
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,360
cognitive robotics or why we like to

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
call all this all this

70
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,760
research or this area cognitive robotics

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,239
and i like a lot this slide which kind

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
of summarizes what it's usually a long

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
introduction on the history of

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
artificial intelligence and robotics

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
um

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
and it just tells this this story of 50

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,319
years of research trying to figure out

78
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,440
how

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,319
can we have machines that are as

80
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,120
intelligent as humans

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
and it comes out that actually this this

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
upper part of the image

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
quite good resolve

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,440
rather

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
fast

86
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,599
we cannot say easily but but

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,119
it was more or less fast

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
and then we have the second part of the

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,799
slide like the bottom part which is what

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,319
comes out to be the most difficult

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,200
challenge for robotics no so what has to

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
do with interaction with the world you

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
have a small child that is capable of

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
handling this these objects in the

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
environment

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
and then you have this other robot that

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,080
can do it but at the time the moment

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,519
that you change the size the weight the

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,239
position whatever you want of the

100
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,959
of the pieces or of the chessboard

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,839
and you actually have a child that with

102
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,880
no problem can adapt himself to to the

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,240
challenge you know

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
and and and the the nerd joke is then on

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
the other side you have

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
another phd that

107
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
has to solve it if you do the same for

108
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
the robot you know

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,160
so in reality what was

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
supposed to or was thought to be

111
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
kind of the the heart the heart problem

112
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
which was having a robot reason and and

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,479
and solve problems

114
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,520
it came out to be quite the the

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,080
not so difficult to solve tasks and and

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
we can talk about

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
uh more difficult challenges

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
that have already been

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
passed

120
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,320
um

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,199
such as i don't know playing go which is

122
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,240
way harder than than chess

123
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,880
and we had alphago a couple of years ago

124
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,960
um well winning against

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
the human the human

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
champion

127
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,520
so

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
we like to think that we are we are

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,639
doing now uh things differently

130
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
we are having robots uh that interact

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
with the world that interact with what's

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
going on around

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
and and they learn through this

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
interaction

135
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
and of course that

136
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,360
gives us lots of challenges and lots of

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
things that we have to solve

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,160
um

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
so

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
now i come from from from this

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
yeah you could think now as an old

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,759
school of internal models

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
um uh

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,199
we we we work in in this um

145
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
in this field for for quite quite

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
already some years

147
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,520
and and it's this this this part of the

148
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
world where there is inverse and forward

149
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,479
models

150
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
um uh

151
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,800
for control of course and and they are

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
they are thought to be behind all these

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,080
all these important issues in in humans

154
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
and since since the beginning of my

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
career we've been doing implementations

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,639
of different types of of

157
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,840
um

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,319
of tools for for these robots but always

159
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,280
based

160
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,840
on these inverse and forward models so

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
just just a quick reminder for for those

162
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,680
that might not be

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
um

164
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
very very

165
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
much into this this type of models so we

166
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,440
had a sensory situation whichever it is

167
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,080
whatever it is and we have a desired

168
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
sensory situation we have an inverse

169
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
model

170
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
that takes as input does those two

171
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
things the the the sensory situation at

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,199
time t of course

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
the sensory situation at time t plus one

174
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,360
which is the desired

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,039
and the inverse model is going to tell

176
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
us uh what's the motor command that

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,080
needs to be performed to go from here to

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,919
here right and

179
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,160
then we have a forward model that takes

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,639
the sensory situation at time t and the

181
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
motor command at time t

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
and gives us

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
the prediction of what's going to happen

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
with this sensory situation

185
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
and so

186
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
we have a prediction error when we well

187
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
we have lots of errors but

188
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,000
um we we are interested on on

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
particularly this um error which is

190
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
the difference between what we actually

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,120
predicted and what happened in the world

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,360
so

193
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,360
we've been doing this for for quite a

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
while

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
uh um

196
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,440
well we've also used this this this

197
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,479
prediction back as a sensory situation

198
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,560
and we can get long-time predictions

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,479
what we called we can do lots of

200
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
comparisons between what we wanted and

201
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,759
what actually happened and

202
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,240
lots of different errors but as as you

203
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
know and well now everyone works with is

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
actually this error

205
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
like the difference between the world

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,960
and

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
what actually i predicted

208
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,160
um

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,879
yeah and so

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
that's that's that's what we

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,039
can say we have in common some years uh

212
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
after after

213
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,760
well some years ago actually we came

214
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,159
across all these all these ideas of

215
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
prediction uh

216
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,200
um

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
producer reproductive processing

218
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
and we started to to

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
to dig into it to see what actually we

220
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,160
could use for our models what what could

221
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
be useful for

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
for improving our models and our our uh

223
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,160
our agent's behaviors

224
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
and uh we have lots of doubts lots of

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
lots of questions

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
but

227
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
one of the first things that we've done

228
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
so far is to look into what happens with

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the error as as

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
an agent is executing an action

231
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,680
sorry

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
um

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
but first i

234
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,959
i'd like you to walk you through

235
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
one of our our implementations well

236
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
first

237
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
where where is actually the um what you

238
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
could call the

239
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
the the crows uh areas

240
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
of what we believe it's it's important

241
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,959
in this case

242
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,480
when we have active inference and

243
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
prediction error minimization

244
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,720
so

245
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
most of us are very familiar with this

246
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
kind of um

247
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,399
representation of of what's happening

248
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,440
actually

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
during during action

250
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
uh and we actually believe that

251
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
prediction a minimizing prediction error

252
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
is what leads to belief updating so

253
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
like the change in a prior belief

254
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,000
encoded as a posterior belief and this

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
is actually informational gain so this

256
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
means learning right

257
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,800
so

258
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
in active inference the expected futures

259
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
their states are fulfilled through

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
action execution we know and this

261
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,880
associated expected prediction error is

262
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
minimized by actively sampling sensory

263
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
information and so the the important

264
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
part for us is this expected prediction

265
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,920
error

266
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,120
and we believe the attribute of a policy

267
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
which can be epistemic and instrumental

268
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
in in case this is this action is

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
novelty searching it's reflecting its

270
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,680
epistemic affordance and we could say

271
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
it's acting for information

272
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,040
uh in case of preference searching no

273
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
this reflects instrumental affordances

274
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
and its action for reward

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,279
so in words of of kirbenstein we can we

276
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
can think of active inference as the

277
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
process

278
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
of selecting relevant affordances

279
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,519
so those which are expected to minimize

280
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
prediction error in a context-sensitive

281
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,839
manner yeah

282
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
so

283
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
what we've done actually or what we

284
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
wanted to to

285
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
actually implement

286
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,279
uh is

287
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,600
how these how these um

288
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,120
expectations about the the

289
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,079
the dynamics of the error um

290
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
cause or are related to feelings to to

291
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
to these

292
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
um

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
embodied feelings and we believe they

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
they allow a sensitivity so how well or

295
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,639
how bad an agent is doing at improving

296
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
the grip on what is relevant in the

297
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
landscape of affordances

298
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
so the sensitivity to changes in the

299
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,920
rate of prediction error reduction is

300
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,279
what we call a prediction aerodynamics

301
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,320
and

302
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
we can say the steeper the slope the

303
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
faster the rate of reduction

304
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,360
um

305
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,920
and we see some some like uh

306
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
yeah

307
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
examples

308
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,000
just just very uh very simple so in in

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
red in in black we could see the actual

310
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,880
error as as like as the action is

311
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,160
executing

312
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,639
and then we have a slope associated to

313
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
this error so

314
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
what we don't want what the agent

315
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,040
doesn't want is this error increasing

316
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
having a positive slope

317
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,959
um

318
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,639
and

319
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,000
on the other hand the error is

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,639
decreasing then we have this slope and

321
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,399
this is actually what we

322
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,959
what we are looking for

323
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,240
so prediction errors are manifested as

324
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
changes on affect

325
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,560
so if the rate of prediction error is

326
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,040
faster than expected we have a positive

327
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
balance and we have an action policy

328
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
which is more precise

329
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
uh one in the case that the error is

330
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
slower than expected or is increasing

331
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,959
unexpectedly we have a negative violence

332
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,120
and an action policy which is less

333
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,839
precise

334
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,600
so

335
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
just just walking you through a couple

336
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,240
of implementations that we have done

337
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
the first one is just kind of

338
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,600
an example of of this mix that we are

339
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,320
trying to have

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
the error is used for learning but we

341
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
have a very simple um

342
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,600
implementation of

343
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
self-organizing maps

344
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
we call it the

345
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,639
self-organized internal models

346
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,480
architecture

347
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,120
the the nice thing on this architecture

348
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,440
is that it actually

349
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,199
sort of doesn't have to have an inverse

350
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,120
model what we have is a an um

351
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,560
self-organizing map that organizes the

352
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,119
motor

353
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
sensor information

354
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,560
and on the other hand we have a visual

355
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
sensory information which is also

356
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,279
organized

357
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
in the same another self-organizing map

358
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
and then we have what we call a

359
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
multi-modal representation and in this

360
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,199
multi-modal representation we have

361
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,920
associations we have associations

362
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,959
between

363
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,519
a sensory situation another sensory

364
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,639
situation

365
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,040
and a motor command

366
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,839
so you could think of this as

367
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,959
an inverse forward model pair but it's

368
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
actually not encoded as such so we just

369
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,360
have associations between sensory

370
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,839
situations and motor commands

371
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,639
and so we we thought this was very

372
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
interesting and we use it for example

373
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,959
for psychotic control

374
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
so the robot has some

375
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
initial sensory situation which is the

376
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
stimulus somewhere in the in in its in

377
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,360
its uh field of view

378
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
and what we need or what what the robot

379
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,880
wants is to phobiate the stimulus no so

380
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
this is the

381
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,120
sensory situation the desired one

382
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,000
and

383
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,199
we ask

384
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,880
this self-organizing maps architecture

385
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,680
what we need to do so to bring

386
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
the stimulus from here to here

387
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
and it's executed and it's not very

388
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
precise so it comes close to the center

389
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
of the image

390
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
and then we use this as the new sensory

391
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
situation

392
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
then we have the same target

393
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,399
we again ask the architecture what what

394
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,720
do we need to do and then it comes very

395
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
close so after 100 runs you can see that

396
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
the robot this is the

397
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,880
starting situation in red we have the

398
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
first

399
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,560
prediction and execution and in green we

400
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,759
have the second prediction and execution

401
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,560
so it's it's it's a very nice simple

402
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
architecture that actually works as i

403
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,199
said before it works like a forward

404
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,279
model but it can also work as an inverse

405
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,399
model

406
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,399
uh we use prediction error to learn

407
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,959
and so

408
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,600
we we could use it as some kind of

409
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
modular um

410
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
architecture

411
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
we can put more maps

412
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,920
and and

413
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
in this case we have the position of the

414
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,040
head visual stimulus the position of the

415
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,000
arm

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
and what the robot can actually do is

417
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,079
find the the the stimulus somewhere in

418
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,199
the space

419
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,759
and then bring it to the to the center

420
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,160
kind of obviate it and then actually

421
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,759
bring the arm also there so we have all

422
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
these associations between movements of

423
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,880
the head movements of the arm

424
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
movements of the eyes

425
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
and all these get associated and are

426
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,240
coded as initial and ending positions

427
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,858
um

428
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,799
[Music]

429
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
okay so

430
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,439
the next question or the next thing we

431
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
tried to do was how can we use

432
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,679
prediction aerodynamics

433
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,160
to guide learning and and this was this

434
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,359
paper we presented a couple of years ago

435
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,918
in in epirope

436
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
was actually guidos kilachi that

437
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
presented it

438
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
which is our co-author

439
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
so it's a work um

440
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
well by guido alejandra syria which is

441
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
also a colleague and myself

442
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,600
and what we did there is

443
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,760
um i i won't uh work on the on the

444
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,679
i won't tell you much about the

445
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,760
the

446
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,919
maps or the or the kind of networks that

447
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,240
were used and in detail the important

448
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,679
part is uh what we see here

449
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,559
so

450
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,880
we have

451
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
a very simple robot this is what you

452
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,000
could see here it's a 2 two degrees of

453
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,039
freedom um camera mounted on

454
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,240
on a

455
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,360
sort of artificial field

456
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,320
uh where we have lots of lots of plants

457
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
and

458
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,799
the the the robot moves towards a

459
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,000
specific destination so it looks it

460
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,960
wants to look at some at some image at

461
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
some point

462
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
um

463
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
and so we have for each movement for

464
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,360
each goal sorry for each goal

465
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
we have a prediction error

466
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,280
here

467
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
so we organize the goals in a sum of

468
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,280
course the goals sorry are encoded using

469
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,799
a an auto encoder we use the middle part

470
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
of the encoder to

471
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
have represented the goals here and the

472
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,000
important part is each each one of these

473
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,840
goals has some prediction error dynamics

474
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,080
yeah and so

475
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
we go back again to our inverse model

476
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
and forward model

477
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
and execute the command the motor

478
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,679
command and we get

479
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,559
our we do our prediction and we get an

480
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,760
error

481
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
between what we wanted and

482
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,600
what happened

483
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
the interesting part and what became

484
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
kind of nice and that was what we wanted

485
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
to implement what we were thinking about

486
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,120
is

487
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
we append this prediction error to as a

488
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
sort of a buffer

489
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,720
and

490
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
this buffer

491
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,360
once that it contains more than four

492
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
predictions we do a linear regression

493
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
and actually what we get is an indicator

494
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
of the progress uh

495
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
how good are we doing so it's kind of a

496
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
tendency for for for

497
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
for learning so

498
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,520
when we have a negative slope it

499
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,159
actually means we are going towards the

500
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,720
goal we are doing fine

501
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,600
so

502
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,480
progress is increasing and it means

503
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
there is a positive emotion

504
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
and we remain on this goal

505
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,880
so learning is going fine when the when

506
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,440
the slope is positive so the activities

507
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
away from the goal there is no progress

508
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
the error keeps increasing

509
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,039
so we have

510
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,600
what we could see as a negative emotion

511
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,799
and

512
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,960
something that can be encourages them to

513
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,559
switch to switch goal

514
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
um

515
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,559
so we have a positive slope means

516
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,320
increase the size of the prediction

517
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,480
error dynamics buffer this was one of

518
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
the

519
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,760
sorry that was uh something of

520
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
kind of interesting and

521
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,720
and very uh yeah new in in in in this in

522
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,960
this field in this area we haven't

523
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
thought about it before and what we

524
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,919
actually did is okay what happens if if

525
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,840
my if my

526
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
slope is positive it means i'm doing

527
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
very bad at this task and what i'm going

528
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,679
to do is i'm going to increase the size

529
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,280
of this buffer

530
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,600
yeah

531
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
when when we have a negative slope it

532
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,000
means okay i'm doing fine

533
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
so i'm going to decrease the size of

534
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,600
this buffer

535
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
so what we are actually doing is

536
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,039
adjusting dynamically the size of this

537
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,679
monitoring window and and and we're

538
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,000
doing that depending on how things are

539
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,320
going with respect to what we are

540
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
actually expecting

541
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
so if the prediction error increases we

542
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,720
have a positive slope and we do a more

543
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,520
frequent evaluation of the feedback

544
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,760
this allows a quick correction of the

545
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
action

546
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,919
and

547
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,679
it can lead to satisfaction in case

548
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,400
where we we managed to to

549
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,360
to do it better and induces abandoning

550
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,799
the goal so after in this case after a

551
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,440
number of iterations interactions

552
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
uh

553
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
where the error is not decreasing the

554
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
error keeps increasing

555
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,039
then we can change

556
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,840
we can switch goals and

557
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
we could say we are trying to avoid

558
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,280
frustration

559
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,039
so

560
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,440
through intrinsic motivation what we try

561
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,039
is search for a new goal

562
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,200
when the prediction error decreases we

563
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,039
have a negative slope

564
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,280
we don't need to

565
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,880
to be evaluating the feedback so so

566
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,240
frequently

567
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
and we can free resources for the agent

568
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
to do something else there is no more

569
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
prediction error so that means we've

570
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,159
achieved our goal so

571
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,039
learning happen learning occur

572
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,159
again

573
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,520
we search for a new goal now

574
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
so

575
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
when we select a new goal we give

576
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,440
priority to those that have a negative

577
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
slope which is kind of a steep in the

578
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,679
prediction aerodynamics and we have some

579
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,520
examples here of how

580
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
the error moves

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,360
uh

582
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,640
as we are moving in in in in the world

583
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
and how the buffer size increases when

584
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,480
the error increases and then it

585
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,320
decreases uh how when when the slope now

586
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
again changes

587
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
so that was that was one of the first

588
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,279
things we did and now actually adam

589
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,919
invited us to this to this uh special

590
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,400
issue that he did in frontiers

591
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,720
and um we we published there a paper

592
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
which is actually well at the beginning

593
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,480
it was about something else and then we

594
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
ended up with this with this

595
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,559
with this model presenting this model

596
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,000
uh this is this is just uh an idea that

597
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
we have

598
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,520
which actually encloses this part that i

599
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,480
talked about about the slopes

600
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,640
and the expected error

601
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
so what what we are what we are

602
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
suggesting here is that

603
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,370
um

604
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,880
[Music]

605
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,559
i don't know how much time we have if i

606
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,039
can go into detail on this but um let's

607
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,440
let's try something very fast so we have

608
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
an agent that has maybe

609
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
physiological needs in case the agent

610
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
doesn't have physiological needs

611
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,679
through intrinsic motivation

612
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
we want to do something new we want to

613
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,039
do

614
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,080
search around the world then we go to

615
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
what we call

616
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,679
the environmental context which brings

617
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,480
us to this field of affordances

618
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,320
uh where there is

619
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,039
loads of actions and each action each

620
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,720
each task has some

621
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
expected expected aerodynamics

622
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,880
we go to a task related context which

623
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,600
comes from selecting the task and then

624
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
we do some planning of sensory motor

625
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
sequences we start acting on the world

626
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,799
and we get some error

627
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,919
as we execute this task

628
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
then we have

629
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,720
two types of monitoring we have

630
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
the typical um

631
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
momentarily say error

632
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
that helps us

633
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,320
go through the planning and correct

634
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,039
the the execution of the task and we

635
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
have a a window

636
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,320
of prediction error dynamics which is

637
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,559
compared to the expected error that this

638
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,840
section had

639
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,000
and according to that

640
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,880
is that we are going to go to these

641
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,559
emotions

642
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,279
that tells us no the the error is

643
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,919
increasing we have this slope here so we

644
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,080
go back to another task

645
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
uh before like of course checking then

646
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
if something has changed we still have

647
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,520
physiological needs or we don't if the

648
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,240
error is not so greatly increasing it's

649
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,559
more or less going fine then we go back

650
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
to this same

651
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
uh planning to the same

652
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
action

653
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
so it's it's a very

654
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,080
uh very very nice uh

655
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,480
model that we thought of it's it's it's

656
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,559
it's on the it's on the make

657
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
uh

658
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,480
and we have many ideas uh

659
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,640
from bringing this

660
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
box diagram into into the world and and

661
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,000
in our in our

662
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
idealistic uh

663
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,200
uh

664
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,360
dream what we are thinking on is

665
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,320
something

666
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,799
actually based on soymag we haven't

667
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,760
implemented this yet but it's something

668
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
based on this oima but now we have lots

669
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,559
of other modules we have

670
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,679
uh some interceptive

671
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,679
internal model representation extra

672
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
receptive um

673
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
model representation

674
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
and this is actually wrong but anyway so

675
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,440
in this site we have all the receptive

676
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,320
information the interceptive information

677
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
and we have some policies and a task and

678
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
some error

679
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
this error is going to tell us how we

680
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
are doing

681
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,600
how we can stay on the task

682
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
uh if the error is too big then we can

683
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,559
change tasks so it's a bit of a mixture

684
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,600
between the the the previous thing i

685
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,840
told you and and this is how it could

686
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,039
look in

687
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,760
what happens on a top down so when we

688
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,480
have a task

689
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
this task is going to activate some

690
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
policies and these policies are going

691
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,840
down

692
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,410
um

693
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,760
[Music]

694
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,960
to act on the world we have again again

695
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,679
uh some error coming up and this error

696
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,720
is somewhat somehow coded here

697
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,039
there is some monitoring so that we can

698
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,799
go on in our policies this is the

699
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,440
momentanus error if the error is very

700
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
big then we can go back here

701
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,880
um

702
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
ah sorry so this is top down and and

703
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
this is actually bottom up no it's

704
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,760
actually the error coming up all the way

705
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
and coding here

706
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,039
and uh

707
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,240
yeah and this is how we start the cycle

708
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,880
with some task policies and everything

709
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
else that is happening in the world

710
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,240
so i think that

711
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,039
we can we can we can stop there

712
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
i hope it's it's clear we don't have

713
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,760
direct questions from the audience as

714
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,840
i'm not seeing anyone or

715
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
i'll ask you uh one question otherwise

716
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
no we have no direct questions but we

717
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,279
can um

718
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,720
definitely accumulate them for the round

719
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
table

720
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
yeah

721
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
what is the relationship between

722
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
prediction error minimization and free

723
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
energy

724
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,960
um

725
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,200
well i i think it's just like part of

726
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,480
the process uh uh i i don't know what

727
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,159
you mean i mean

728
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,799
within the whole thing of of

729
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,679
whatever you want free energy um

730
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,120
everything that is happening the

731
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,360
difference between the expected

732
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,080
uh states and what actually happened in

733
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
the world so

734
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,480
we always have in in inactive inference

735
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
or in free energy you always have an

736
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,399
error happening in in what's happening

737
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,640
what's in what's

738
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
yeah what is happening in the in the

739
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
action of the in the world

740
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,799
so

741
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,679
through

742
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,520
this prediction error

743
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,720
is how you are we we believe it's going

744
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
to happen like the learning is going to

745
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
occur

746
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,880
i don't know i don't know if

747
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
yes that's awesome well

748
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
yeah yeah thank you very much hope to

749
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
see you very soon

750
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,919
yeah we'll see you like in in two hours

751
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,799
or so

752
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,840
excellent see you soon

753
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,240
yeah okay thank you very much hope to

754
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,200
see you very soon

755
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,559
all right welcome everyone we are back

756
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,519
this next presentation is going to be by

757
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,799
matt brown real robotic control through

758
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
embodied homeostatic feedback so matt

759
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,519
thank you very much for co-organizing

760
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,480
and for also joining to present and

761
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,919
please take it away

762
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,679
uh yeah thank you uh for having me here

763
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,279
and that was a really great talk renault

764
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,120
um i have some follow-up questions for

765
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,519
later um but yeah thanks for coming and

766
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,120
uh my name is matt i'll be taking

767
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,960
talking a bit about um a long-running

768
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
research project and uh i hope you guys

769
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
find this interesting um

770
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,279
this here's a quick high-level

771
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,440
description of the project project um

772
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,360
it's kind of an alternate way of looking

773
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
at the generative modeling process built

774
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
around homeostasis from the bottom up uh

775
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,279
this approach is very different a bit of

776
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,360
an orthodox approach and i'll be going

777
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,440
into a bit of detail about how this

778
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
works um you could probably read it but

779
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,600
the short version is based on theories

780
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
of ross ashby and his homeostat and it's

781
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,200
a new kind of adaptive model that uses

782
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
uh learns via homeostatic feedback

783
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,279
through an environment and it's uh

784
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,960
and itself uh and i'll be showing some

785
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,320
demos about applying this to robotic

786
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,519
control uh that i've been working on

787
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,519
lately

788
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,519
uh just a quick agenda um i'll be

789
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,200
talking a bit about uh the project

790
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
background uh where it came from because

791
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,519
it is kind of unusual i figured some

792
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
background might be useful uh then i'll

793
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,159
be talking about um how homeostats uh

794
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,880
build network self models um and what

795
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
that means and how those function and

796
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,000
then i'll be talking about plugging

797
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,760
those into environments uh and how

798
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,080
embodiment works and how synchronization

799
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,399
functions uh in this process uh and then

800
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,880
i'll be doing some uh demonstrations uh

801
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,679
showing this working with robotics

802
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,760
um yeah so just to give you background

803
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,640
on myself uh i'm a computer scientist

804
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
mostly i'm not much of an academic i

805
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
have a few published papers but not on

806
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,800
this particular topic um

807
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,480
i've been obsessed with the mechanisms

808
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,440
of thought for most of my life um i

809
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,639
i've worked in the video game industry

810
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,480
for about a dozen years uh and then

811
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,918
worked in deep enforcement learning for

812
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,119
a number of years um and also uh about

813
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,879
20 years ago was uh worked in software

814
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,399
radio uh at the spectrumware project

815
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,679
which became genie radio that'll be

816
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,159
relevant later um today i'll be talking

817
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,079
about uh work that's uh now going on

818
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
going at my uh startup thoughtforge and

819
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,239
talking a bit about the history uh will

820
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,159
help explain what i'm doing i think uh

821
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,359
this started about uh 2006-2007 uh with

822
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,760
um deep learning was kind of new and was

823
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,239
kind of uh the new hot thing i did a big

824
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,000
deep dive into it really excited about

825
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,239
it uh but i was in fact quite uh

826
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,839
dissatisfied and i felt that um

827
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,000
deep learning and the this approach of

828
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,520
using neural networks didn't really

829
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,440
provide much insight to how learning

830
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,400
works in in natural systems uh and even

831
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,760
in the last few years i feel like we

832
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
have this amazing hammer with deep

833
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,400
learning and everything suddenly uh

834
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,240
looks like nails uh and i feel like we

835
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,280
need to take a step back and look

836
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
critically at what we're what problem

837
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
we're trying to solve so for me uh i was

838
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,560
looking for new approaches in the nature

839
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,040
of uh agency and goals uh goals in terms

840
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
of what what are they and how do they

841
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,640
manifest in nature um semantic

842
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
information versus raw information how

843
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,200
do bra sensory signals become meaningful

844
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
uh and also uh i wanted more insight

845
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,119
into how time played into this learning

846
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,280
process uh and i was in particular

847
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
looking for media agnostic approaches um

848
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,119
not neurons specifically how do plants

849
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,520
in single-celled organisms um deal with

850
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
their world uh so i started by reading a

851
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,079
lot um uh going back in time chaos

852
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,920
theory i was a big fan of i ran into

853
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,000
matarana and varela and autopisos and i

854
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,119
was really excited about that but it was

855
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,720
too abstract for me as an engineer i

856
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,040
think to tackle and so i kept going

857
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,320
until i got to

858
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
homeostasis and cybernetics and

859
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
particularly a cyberneticist named ross

860
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,800
ashby um and i basically became obsessed

861
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
with ross ashby and you know to still am

862
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,320
to a certain degree uh and he's not a

863
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,680
part of most computer science programs

864
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,000
so um he's quite well known outside of

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
computer science but i felt um is not

866
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
part of my own uh

867
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,800
education uh and he's most known for

868
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,640
things like the the law of requisite

869
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,800
variety and the good regulator theorem

870
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,760
uh and those will be common themes um

871
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,720
uh in the next 30 minutes or so um so

872
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,320
what i started doing is pouring through

873
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
ashby's technical journals recreating

874
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
his work in a particular device called

875
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,520
the homeostat um so this is just a quick

876
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,119
slide to tell people about uh the

877
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,119
homeostatin aspie uh no doubt many

878
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,640
people watching this probably are

879
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,320
familiar with ashby and perhaps the

880
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,000
homeostat uh but it's worth going over

881
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
briefly regardless um if you look up on

882
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
wikipedia it'll say homeostat is one of

883
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,760
the first devices capable of adapting

884
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,119
itself to the environment and it

885
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
exhibited behavior such as habituation

886
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,560
reinforcement and learning through its

887
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
ability to maintain homeostasis in a

888
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,640
changing environment um

889
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
ashby viewed uh you know learning as

890
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,839
adaptation and stability um and was

891
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,680
described as an isomorphism generating

892
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,240
machine and most importantly for me um

893
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,880
it uses feedback to generate hemostasis

894
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,599
via a property called ultra stability um

895
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,720
so i'll be talking about that here

896
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
there's a description here from one of

897
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,839
his books about it uh but um it is quite

898
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,240
tricky to re reproduce i had to go to

899
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,640
his uh personal technical journals um

900
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
and lots of iteration before i got it

901
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,640
working um the key for me uh was ultra

902
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
stability which is a very strange kind

903
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,480
of property but it is the individual

904
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,320
node property within this four node

905
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,480
homeostat that enabled this general

906
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,920
property this group property of

907
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,079
homeostasis to take place uh and it's

908
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,760
part of the function of how oops let me

909
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,720
go back

910
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
uh it's part of the uh function of how

911
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,800
the homeostat works uh and it's in the

912
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,680
property

913
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,000
implemented by individual nodes uh using

914
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,880
a simple set of rules that gives rise to

915
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,000
group homeostasis uh it's comprised of a

916
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,839
double feedback loop where like the low

917
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,200
level feedback loop performs like a

918
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
linear transformation and then a high

919
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,560
level feedback loop

920
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,640
modifies this linear transformation uh

921
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,480
and is designed to seek equilibrium

922
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,440
meaning output of zero which is you can

923
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
if you think of the um this each of

924
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,599
these nodes as seeking um uh uh uh

925
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,400
equilibrium of a state of zero um

926
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,359
every

927
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,200
choice of a linear transformation is a

928
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,359
prediction of a type and so uh the

929
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,680
result of this uh linear transformation

930
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,760
every at every moment uh accumulates

931
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,560
prediction error uh as uh as it seeks a

932
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,720
zero prediction error so um it's kind of

933
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,880
an interesting goal driven

934
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,520
process that uh works through multi uh

935
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,839
group process um

936
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,839
this is just a more in-depth description

937
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,680
of uh the homeostat basically

938
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,599
constructed of four individual

939
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,320
ultra-stable nodes um

940
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,400
and the network as a whole creates an

941
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
adaptive dynamical tractor set as a

942
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,720
self-consistent reinforcing self-model

943
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,599
um

944
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,119
ultimate stability powers its race of

945
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,119
states disabled states space space

946
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,680
exploration uh through like the law of

947
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,599
representative variety uh and can be

948
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,760
seen as a network of uh reciprocal

949
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,079
reciprocal constraints

950
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,200
um

951
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
this is just an interesting letter uh

952
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
from uh

953
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,240
uh alan turing to ashby uh back when

954
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,400
they were members of the ratio club um

955
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,040
and ashley was getting some notoriety um

956
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,839
hearing um basically disagreed with

957
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,160
ashley's approach and you know this

958
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,839
letter here he suggests that ashby

959
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,760
simply uh so uh simulate his homeostat

960
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,440
in his uh tiering machine um and while

961
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,359
true uh i think this uh actually was a

962
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,839
bit taken aback by this um

963
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,000
because it kind of misses the point um

964
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
at the time the debate was all about

965
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,040
analog versus digital computation um and

966
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
you know uh what was useful to the war

967
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,599
effort uh was most critical um but there

968
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,440
was a bit of a conflation here i think

969
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
in terms of what aspect was trying to

970
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,400
create which was something more along

971
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,560
the lines of universal adaptation or

972
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
universal cognition maybe um versus

973
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,760
turing's universal computation uh and

974
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,920
you know uh i feel like this conflation

975
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,079
of issues still haunts us today with

976
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,440
deep learning and whether or not they're

977
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,079
intelligent um

978
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,599
so how do you build them so uh

979
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,079
essentially i took tyrion's advice and

980
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,520
simulated um

981
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
and particularly uh 20 years ago as part

982
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,960
of the spectrum wear project which uh

983
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,240
you know kind of pioneered software

984
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,200
radio uh which is now part called geniu

985
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,359
radio uh and so i kind of stole

986
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,000
methodologies from this approach where i

987
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,319
you know i created the homeostat as a

988
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,319
digital simulation of a continuous

989
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,720
analog system or device um

990
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,319
and so that's kind of the approach i

991
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,200
took

992
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,520
um i started by pointing through ask

993
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
these technical journals um you know and

994
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,319
experimented with different

995
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,680
implementations and approaches of his

996
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,560
direct analog machine um once this was

997
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,640
functional uh it was simple enough to

998
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
abstract down to very simple kind of

999
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
minimal process um once it's functional

1000
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,040
you can start taking pieces out and see

1001
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,119
what what breaks it and what doesn't uh

1002
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,800
and eventually this uh effectively

1003
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
simplified down to a dynamical attractor

1004
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,560
definition for ultra stability uh that

1005
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,160
could be connected into arbitrary

1006
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,240
network topologies uh and the network as

1007
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,599
a whole can be kind of seen as a self

1008
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,280
model uh each node is trying to protect

1009
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,599
its neighbor as it seeks equilibrium um

1010
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,520
and the local ultra stability tunes

1011
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,280
nodes local connections and the

1012
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,480
resulting positive and negative

1013
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,720
feedbacks loops that it is personally a

1014
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,520
part of and ultra speedy tunes these as

1015
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,599
a group of these overlapping feedback

1016
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,800
loops such that they reach the

1017
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
homeostatic equilibrium uh and that

1018
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
means that the uh local prediction

1019
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,599
accumulated prediction error drops to

1020
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,200
zero as well the as well as the output

1021
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
uh uh from each node uh and these

1022
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,319
overlapping loops become

1023
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,319
self-reinforcing and self-repairing uh

1024
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,560
and it's uh this final self-predicting

1025
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,640
set of loops that you know uh maintains

1026
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
a self-model uh at homeostatic

1027
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,079
equilibrium this model converges and

1028
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,560
considered self-consistent um it is

1029
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,319
composed of um

1030
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,319
these homeostatic feedback loops that

1031
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,160
maintain the network at a critical state

1032
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,760
uh meaning that um the network is highly

1033
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,359
sensitive to prediction error i mean the

1034
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,640
smalling the smallest prediction error

1035
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
can trigger global structural changes

1036
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
amongst these feedback loops and this

1037
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,920
process can also be seen as

1038
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,119
synchronization

1039
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,520
which i can talk about uh a bit later

1040
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,240
um so let me show a quick demo i'm gonna

1041
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,960
skip the original homeostat here and i'm

1042
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,800
going to um

1043
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
uh show a quick demonstration of what

1044
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,880
this actually looks like for a 20 node

1045
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,040
homeostat it takes a bit longer and it's

1046
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,160
a little more

1047
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,400
demonstrative so let me let me switch

1048
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,680
briefly here and apologize for the delay

1049
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,560
while i get this up

1050
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,839
um

1051
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,079
cool all right so let me just describe

1052
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,599
what you're seeing here uh you're seeing

1053
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,520
20 single dimensional graphs you could

1054
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
uh this is the accumulated local

1055
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,880
prediction error at each node of the 20

1056
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,720
node homeostat

1057
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,800
you can also think of this as one

1058
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,359
20-dimensional uh dynamical attractor or

1059
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,359
20 single-dimensional uh dynamical

1060
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,560
tractors these are also kind of you

1061
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,359
consider these as phase space graphs um

1062
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,200
for each of the nodes uh so what you're

1063
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,040
seeing here is i have a pause i'm going

1064
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,560
to move it along slowly this is slowed

1065
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,880
down uh on purpose uh and what you'll

1066
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,280
see is they start off very chaotically

1067
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
um and you know what'll happen is a

1068
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
couple nodes will start stabilizing uh

1069
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,880
then more will start stabilizing and

1070
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,520
then eventually uh the entire network

1071
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,119
will converge to

1072
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,400
zero prediction error now this is

1073
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,920
unconnected to an environment so it's

1074
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,640
just

1075
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,280
predicting itself uh one thing i like to

1076
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,720
do here and i don't know how many people

1077
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,880
else are going to find this interesting

1078
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
i want to show a little in-depth look at

1079
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,440
what this final convergence and collapse

1080
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,079
to zero looks like um so um what i'm

1081
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,000
going to do is i'm going to

1082
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,480
change this to auto scaling the the

1083
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,040
graphs meaning that as it goes to zero

1084
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,640
you'll see the the

1085
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,680
the graph ranges drop uh and uh and what

1086
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,280
you'll should see is this uh usually

1087
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,880
there's a pattern forms amongst the

1088
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
output nodes um that is kind of

1089
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,480
consistent with every drop what you'll

1090
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,000
see is that you know um it's kind of

1091
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
hard to see with 20 nodes especially

1092
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,560
i've gone a little too far we're already

1093
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,359
at e negative 20 here um but what you're

1094
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,480
seeing is you're seeing the 20

1095
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,079
dimensional drop to zero and there's

1096
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,920
kind of like a cyclical pattern to this

1097
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,119
uh and every time it goes through this

1098
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,880
pattern it drops down another order of

1099
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,160
magnitude and this will go all the way

1100
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,640
down to uh the floating point error of

1101
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,960
my computer which is about negative 46 i

1102
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,200
believe uh and then it basically fails

1103
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,640
to function at that point because it

1104
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,319
can't tell the difference uh floating

1105
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,240
point error uh it can no longer function

1106
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,960
so

1107
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,319
and the whole thing kind of falls apart

1108
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,200
there um but um that kind of shows you a

1109
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,119
bit about the process um let me go

1110
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,880
quickly back to the

1111
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,280
uh the slides

1112
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,040
so yeah that just kind of showed you a

1113
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
slowed down version of the 20

1114
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,560
dimensional homeostat and i want to show

1115
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,240
the 20 dimensional because it happens a

1116
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
lot slower and it's a little uh easier

1117
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,040
to see what's going on with four nodes

1118
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,400
it's almost instantaneous and it's hard

1119
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,800
to see the progression

1120
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,400
um okay

1121
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,359
um so that seems like a lot of work for

1122
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,119
a model that doesn't really do anything

1123
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,520
is a connective environment so you know

1124
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,800
we have this model that can adapt this

1125
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,319
internal structure to reach homeostatic

1126
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,760
equilibrium through kind of a

1127
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,000
self-synchronization process um how do

1128
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,280
we use this to drive behavior and you

1129
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,960
know this next step took me a few years

1130
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,400
uh even though it's kind of conceptually

1131
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
simple um but don't worry it'll uh it'll

1132
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,280
get complex really quickly

1133
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,040
the short version is sensors and motors

1134
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
kind of define how the agent is embedded

1135
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,160
into an environment

1136
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,960
and

1137
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,560
the network topology defines the

1138
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
adaptive capacity of the homeostatic

1139
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,720
agent's model uh sensitive definitions

1140
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,240
provide a mechanism to influence the

1141
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,880
behavior of the system by providing uh

1142
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,079
priors in the form of preferred

1143
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,000
environmental states these act is kind

1144
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
of like tela dynamic priors uh

1145
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,760
externally defined dynamic set points

1146
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,480
for the homeostatic adaptation um the

1147
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,920
motor definitions provide clinical

1148
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,359
affordances for modifying the

1149
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,280
environment that provides the basis for

1150
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,520
future sensory predictions

1151
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,880
uh the preferred states of the sensors

1152
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,640
become the preferred outcomes of the

1153
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,880
motors and the model's behavior is

1154
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,200
biased as as desired

1155
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,640
this is probably most people on this

1156
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
active inference symposium are probably

1157
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,280
familiar with this idea

1158
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,440
uh this slide is put together um

1159
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,800
for the benefit of people who are kind

1160
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,000
of familiar with traditional deep

1161
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,240
learning and neural network approaches

1162
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,000
to contrast how these networks function

1163
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,960
differently

1164
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,240
because it's a bit hard for people to

1165
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,560
get their head around um the first

1166
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,400
it is probably the most obvious is

1167
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,319
there's no back propagation here uh only

1168
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,839
ultra stability which is kind of a local

1169
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,040
rule um this uh leads to huge sample

1170
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,960
efficiency and uh the learning is very

1171
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,800
structured meaning you don't have to you

1172
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,880
know diffuse learning across you know

1173
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,880
thousands or millions of parameters you

1174
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,560
know you only have to model the part of

1175
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,920
the uh you don't have to update the part

1176
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,440
of the model that

1177
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,280
is mispredicting or you know is part of

1178
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,359
a misprediction um

1179
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,599
the other thing to notice is that um

1180
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,599
this is not a temporal most uh neural

1181
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,359
networks and you know like deep learning

1182
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,359
networks are kind of disembodied

1183
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,079
atemporal processes um this is very much

1184
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,240
a temporal process uh you know

1185
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,640
signals take time to move from one node

1186
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,560
to another which makes it inherently the

1187
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,160
whole thing very temporal uh the

1188
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,520
resulting temporal relationships are

1189
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,599
important actually um spatial

1190
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,680
relationships of sensors and motors end

1191
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,920
up getting encoded into temporal

1192
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,520
relative temporal relationships within

1193
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,920
the sensory signals um such and also

1194
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,680
vice versa signal timings of the

1195
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,280
propagating signals within the network

1196
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,440
can translate into different physical

1197
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,280
spatial relationships amongst the output

1198
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
motors uh for example or the input

1199
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
sensors um so there's a relationship um

1200
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,319
between uh temporal location relative

1201
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,400
timing of signals and the spatial

1202
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,559
location of sensors and motors and the

1203
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,000
physical embodied

1204
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,800
agent

1205
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,559
um different in the you know just to

1206
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,920
kind of you know push on that a little

1207
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,760
farther the different regions within

1208
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,520
this larger homeostatic network will

1209
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,599
then be sensitive to different sets of

1210
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,559
motors and sense of sensors um based on

1211
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,160
their physical uh relative location um

1212
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,720
and uh by contrast you know

1213
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,920
you know deep learning deep enforcement

1214
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,200
learning uh deep reinforcement learning

1215
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,559
for example is an attempt at adding

1216
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,880
temporality to an otherwise a temporal

1217
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,680
static uh deep learning models um you

1218
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,520
know the other way to compare these two

1219
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,119
is you know deep learning models are

1220
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,720
generally trying to be general function

1221
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,119
universal function approximators uh in

1222
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,319
uh where this is much more uh

1223
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,720
generative and inherently temporal uh

1224
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,720
the very learning is very very different

1225
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,119
um and uh just to expand a bit more on

1226
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,359
the topics from the previous slide um

1227
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,960
the network diagram here on the right is

1228
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,280
very oversimplified uh network and it's

1229
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,880
just a meant to visually explain how to

1230
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,240
think about some of these networks uh

1231
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,160
there's no forward or backward no front

1232
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,119
back top bottom um only kind of relative

1233
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,760
relative location from other nodes and

1234
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,680
from sensors and motors perhaps more

1235
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,000
relevantly um and

1236
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,559
it is um you know common for people to

1237
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,160
look at the learning process as a

1238
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,000
sequential flow of processing like

1239
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,160
sensing perceiving then acting uh or

1240
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,319
plan planning than acting uh and instead

1241
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,359
you know you have to kind of think of

1242
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,200
this as all happening at the same time

1243
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,559
merging together is kind of one whole

1244
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,800
perceptual motor system uh not a

1245
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,200
traditional uh sandwich uh model time

1246
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,040
simply advances and we simulate the

1247
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,640
analog systems as signals propagate

1248
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,559
across the network uh and so you know

1249
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,079
you don't get input from the sensors

1250
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,599
calculate the network and get alpha

1251
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,599
motors you get you send them input to

1252
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,040
the sensors you get out from the motors

1253
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,400
base and those motor actions are

1254
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,680
basically based on the generative

1255
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,280
model's prediction of what it should be

1256
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,119
doing already before having it even

1257
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,000
sensed the world um

1258
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,800
so

1259
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
the you know what's interesting here

1260
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,160
from the model point of view in terms of

1261
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,760
how this homeostasis works is the

1262
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,680
network's homeostatic feedback loops

1263
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,200
come to be dependent on the expected

1264
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,079
sensory signals uh meaning that the the

1265
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,079
the sensory signals become entrained in

1266
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,000
the homeostatic self-maintenance

1267
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,319
processes um which kind of naturally

1268
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,119
makes it grounded in the body experience

1269
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,880
this uh and this you know homeostatic

1270
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,480
self-maintenance process is composed of

1271
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,160
the environmental signals themselves as

1272
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,920
part of its predictions and expectations

1273
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,920
um expectations and predictions for the

1274
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,200
consequences of motor actions are

1275
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,720
embedded in the signal sentence through

1276
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,400
the sensors from deeper in the network

1277
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,319
like on the right here and uh they're

1278
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,760
sent to the sensors where expectation

1279
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,040
meets reality and prediction errors

1280
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,520
cascade backwards uh and modify the

1281
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,280
internal structure of the model uh as

1282
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,200
polynomials model update um these and

1283
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,880
then motor actions are accompanied by

1284
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,319
these parallel sensory prediction

1285
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,000
signals that flow uh from the deeper in

1286
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,839
the network uh the actions taken at any

1287
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,359
moment are not based on the latest input

1288
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,800
but based on predictions driven from

1289
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,480
deeper in the network uh

1290
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,839
from the same

1291
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,000
places that the sensory expectations are

1292
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
sent from uh this may be familiar to

1293
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,400
those uh who who are you know think like

1294
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,160
uh familiar with predictive processing

1295
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,680
or perceptual control theory and the

1296
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,839
idea here is that you know where the

1297
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,760
sensors and motors meet the network you

1298
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,480
know the the network itself is trying to

1299
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,559
make those local prediction errors zero

1300
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,160
meaning it's trying to anticipate the

1301
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,720
actual sensory experience um through

1302
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,440
kind of inverse modeling

1303
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,960
um so another just kind of quick look at

1304
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,640
uh you know how to look at this

1305
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,000
homeostatic process is through

1306
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,680
synchronization

1307
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,240
this process can be seen as generating

1308
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,920
an adaptive synchronization manifold

1309
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,000
between an agent and an environment um

1310
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
around minimization of prediction error

1311
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,359
um this is kind of looking at

1312
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,720
synchronization as prediction you know

1313
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,640
when when a system when two sentences

1314
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,000
are synchronized they can be thought of

1315
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,240
as predicting each other anticipating

1316
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,720
the other uh the others motions uh and

1317
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,559
individual nodes using ultra stability

1318
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,559
are using alter stability to learn how

1319
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,000
to predict their neighbors and when that

1320
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,520
equilibrium these nodes are kind of

1321
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,800
synchronized through these feedback

1322
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,200
loops um and the synchronization spreads

1323
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,119
um from individual nodes to whole

1324
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,040
network synchronization and ultimately

1325
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,800
uh out from the motors and backing

1326
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,400
through the sensors um in a

1327
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,000
synchronization manifold between the

1328
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,640
agent and environment um you know to say

1329
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,160
it another way the overlapping feedback

1330
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,520
loops interact and synchronize with each

1331
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,040
other as part of this homeostatic self

1332
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,640
maintenance and as these feedback loops

1333
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,000
extend from motors to the environment

1334
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,760
the sensors the model gains ability to

1335
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,920
anticipate the consequences of its own

1336
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,680
actions uh and the capacity to

1337
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,800
synchronize internal states with

1338
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,160
something in the external world the

1339
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,440
synchronization means that you know

1340
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
internal states will come to resemble uh

1341
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,480
the in

1342
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,000
one will come to resemble the internal

1343
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
states of the other um this is kind of

1344
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,440
along the lines of you know the good

1345
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,240
regulator theorem um when at this you

1346
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,079
know synchronized homeostatic state it's

1347
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,520
also in this critical state i mentioned

1348
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,640
this earlier um where it's stable uh but

1349
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,240
it's sensitive to local prediction error

1350
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,160
so the meaning that the the model uh

1351
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,000
this critical state is maintained as

1352
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,520
long as as long as local prediction area

1353
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,760
is maintained within a certain threshold

1354
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,599
um and but otherwise you know the

1355
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,200
smallest prediction error can trigger

1356
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,800
global kind of structural changes within

1357
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,720
these feedback loops uh in order to

1358
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,880
better predict the future uh you know in

1359
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,160
order to maintain a synchronization

1360
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,599
network must be able to converge to

1361
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,359
equilibrium faster than the environment

1362
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,880
can destabilize it um and so there's um

1363
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,319
you know so there's update you know

1364
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,680
network update rates where we have to

1365
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,559
maintain um you know this kind of

1366
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,480
fast movement and this kind of is in

1367
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,839
line with the law of requisite variety

1368
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,760
where we have to make sure that we can

1369
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,680
explore state spaces faster than the

1370
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,680
environment we're attempting to control

1371
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,559
um

1372
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,160
and as long as the homeostatic network

1373
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,079
can re-establi establish these stable

1374
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,839
feedback loops faster than

1375
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,920
then this synchronization manifold will

1376
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,240
be maintained uh and synchronization is

1377
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,160
kind of an interesting thing um

1378
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,800
especially in the context of um robotic

1379
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,680
control um because you know once kind of

1380
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,200
two elements are synchronized you know

1381
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,359
let's say you have a sub network that's

1382
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,280
synchronous synchronized then you know

1383
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,599
two indirectly two nodes that are not

1384
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,839
directly connected uh can end up

1385
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,280
coordinating without any kind of

1386
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,640
communication between the two because

1387
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,960
they've been previously synchronized uh

1388
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,160
their behavior will end up being

1389
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,520
correlated as well um

1390
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,079
and in case it's uh interesting to think

1391
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,640
about um you know what is the structure

1392
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
of these kind of feedback loops and this

1393
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,240
you know generative model and the way i

1394
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,160
like to think about it is

1395
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,040
a dynamic holarchy meaning um you know a

1396
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,200
hierarchy is kind of like uh you know a

1397
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,599
top-down construction um but you know a

1398
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,160
dynamic holocaust is more like a um a

1399
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,839
bottom-up construction where the parents

1400
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,480
are composed of the children and dynamic

1401
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,559
in that as the children change their own

1402
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,160
self-definitions the parents are

1403
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,400
likewise changed so it's kind of

1404
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
constantly shifting and changing over

1405
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
time as the children redefine themselves

1406
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,079
uh and this structure is very useful uh

1407
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,839
as a gender model as allows a small

1408
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,280
number of individuals to you know kind

1409
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,079
of reshape the hierarchy very quickly as

1410
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,880
it's part of an ongoing dynamic process

1411
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,839
um cool so i'll switch over and do some

1412
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,319
quick kind of uh demonstrations showing

1413
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,640
how this ends up you know why would you

1414
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,520
actually want to do this um you know

1415
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,880
yeah why would you actually want to do

1416
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,160
this especially in the context of

1417
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,160
robotics um

1418
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,240
so the first thing i'm going to show

1419
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,479
is um let me just share here quickly

1420
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,359
this is the demo i put together um a

1421
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,680
couple years ago actually let me

1422
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,119
let me shrink the screen a little bit so

1423
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,640
it's not quite so much to share

1424
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,960
uh this was put together a couple years

1425
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,040
ago to kind of demonstrate you know why

1426
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,200
would you do why would you do robotics

1427
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,040
like this you know what is the point um

1428
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,480
and you know what does robustness mean

1429
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,799
and what does additivity mean uh in the

1430
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,160
context of uh robotics so hopefully you

1431
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,720
can see now on my screen this is just a

1432
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,079
simple um

1433
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,359
modification of an open ai gym called uh

1434
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,200
reacher uh and what it's been modified

1435
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,680
to add a single texture joint here uh

1436
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,400
and

1437
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,680
the reasons will be obvious here in a

1438
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,480
minute um but um this is just a simple

1439
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,079
task let's try the you know the model

1440
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,359
has to get its end effector to the

1441
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,040
target position and this is using these

1442
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,200
homeostatic models here um but here's

1443
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,160
what's interesting i can do and it

1444
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,440
hasn't this model hasn't seen this

1445
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
situation yet i can disable the outer

1446
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,119
motor for example

1447
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,680
and it will basically on the fly figure

1448
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,079
out how to achieve the goal um you know

1449
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,680
just by updating its internal model and

1450
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,880
saying oh this motor doesn't work

1451
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,440
anymore let me let me modify my my model

1452
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,520
of the world i can turn that back on and

1453
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,599
um he'll start using it immediately or

1454
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,200
it will start using immediately i can do

1455
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,040
the same with the internal motor

1456
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,520
it can turn that off and so oops i did

1457
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,240
not turn it off

1458
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,599
there we go now now it's off

1459
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,839
um yeah so and it just kind of figures

1460
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,520
out oh okay the the inner motor i have

1461
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,040
no longer have access to let me update

1462
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,880
my model and i can again turn that back

1463
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,040
on and it'll start using it again um so

1464
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,079
this was just kind of a simple

1465
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,160
demonstration i made a couple years ago

1466
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,160
to show why you would want to do

1467
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,599
robotics this way in that you can kind

1468
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,359
of get this real-time adaptation to

1469
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,079
unexpected situations um due to the the

1470
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,359
generative model that's constructed this

1471
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,599
way um now let me just scoot forward a

1472
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,920
little bit to more recent work

1473
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,760
um

1474
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,079
and hopefully um the frame rate won't be

1475
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,960
too bad over zoom

1476
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,280
let me just

1477
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,040
shrink the window a little bit in hopes

1478
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,520
that helps

1479
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,400
okay let me um

1480
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,960
share this

1481
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,960
the frame rate just feels a little rough

1482
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,839
over over a zoom here um but this is all

1483
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,079
just running locally on machine so this

1484
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,559
is something a little more uh recent a

1485
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,240
little more complicated we made the goal

1486
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,720
a little bit more complica complex uh

1487
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,319
and we've used a full six degree of

1488
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,400
freedom arm here from like an uh this is

1489
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,119
actually a fetch robot mobile arm um but

1490
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,400
something a little more realistic than

1491
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,520
like a toy problem uh and i'm just you

1492
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,119
know continue periodically here

1493
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,760
re-targeting the the desired angle for

1494
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,599
this valve and so this is just a robot

1495
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,480
that turns valves uh and what i've done

1496
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,520
is that um i i can periodically change

1497
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,280
the set point for its des you know where

1498
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,880
how it sees the world basically use

1499
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,559
defined goals by you know defining

1500
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,319
preferred states of the world uh and

1501
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,920
then the homeostatic model basically

1502
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,000
figures out how to control the robot to

1503
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,799
to uh to affect the you know the state

1504
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,799
of the world that it wants um

1505
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,640
i'm hoping here every 30 seconds it will

1506
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,280
randomize the um the valve shape the

1507
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,040
square one here is the simplest one but

1508
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,480
let me add some

1509
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,720
random motion and random orientation the

1510
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,000
model has not seen this before either so

1511
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,839
it just kind of learns on the fly how to

1512
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,440
deal with this kind of moving shape as i

1513
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,040
do it i can also do it with a sinusoidal

1514
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,240
motion here so imagine it's on a

1515
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,960
floating platform um where the rotation

1516
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,799
and the uh position are kind of moving

1517
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,799
through space um here we go now we got

1518
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,160
something more interesting so now we

1519
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,920
have it still moving through space it's

1520
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,079
a circular valve here something a little

1521
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,240
harder to turn um and what i'm going to

1522
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,240
do is i'm going to make it very slippery

1523
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,160
so imagine i've just poured oil over it

1524
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,520
so if now it's having to deal with a

1525
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,880
really really slippery valve here that

1526
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,640
it has to turn and still manages to do

1527
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,559
it even though it's really hard um but

1528
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,480
you can get the idea here is you know uh

1529
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,000
if you do the generative model in this

1530
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,920
kind of sample efficient way you can

1531
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,799
kind of um get natural um you know

1532
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,480
adaptation to whatever it's kind of

1533
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,520
experiencing in the moment here um

1534
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,559
so

1535
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,880
i think i've kind of i think this is

1536
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,319
maybe maybe i'll do the random motion

1537
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,559
again maybe that's interesting um

1538
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:31,760
but yeah there's all sorts of stuff you

1539
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,960
can kind of throw at this and go kind of

1540
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,720
deal with it i apologize for the frame

1541
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,240
right i'm going to blame zoom for that

1542
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,760
um

1543
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,119
so

1544
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,240
cool all right good um

1545
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,400
i don't think i have too much left

1546
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,200
but

1547
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,520
you know

1548
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,359
next steps are uh basically improving

1549
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,599
automation and tools um i'm working uh

1550
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,040
my startup is basically developing this

1551
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,000
for um for real world use uh in adaptive

1552
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
situations where you need um fine motor

1553
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,720
control uh and kind of uh dexterous

1554
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,920
object manipulation in uncertain

1555
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,079
environments um you know it's on the

1556
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,599
technical side we're looking at you know

1557
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,119
scaling up both specifications and

1558
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,440
topologies which are related as well as

1559
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,040
you know deeper temporal horizons in

1560
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,440
both directions planning uh and ahead

1561
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,760
and recall um but yeah that's um about

1562
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,079
all i had for today uh and i look

1563
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,400
forward to the questions during the uh

1564
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,760
the um

1565
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,400
round table in a little bit if anybody

1566
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,240
has questions now i can talk to it as

1567
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,280
well

1568
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,720
i'm a little i went a little fast i

1569
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,920
apologize

1570
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,440
i'm a fast talker

1571
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,079
it was great just maybe one preliminary

1572
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,839
question

1573
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,960
what settings do you see

1574
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,480
these

1575
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,280
uh kinds of implementations occurring in

1576
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,240
first and then the other question

1577
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,559
in order or if it's your preference is

1578
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,599
how do you see the homeostatic network

1579
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,400
related to the analytical

1580
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,799
first principles foundations of active

1581
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,280
inference as we know it today

1582
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,640
yeah no um those are really good

1583
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,480
questions and i you know i i didn't talk

1584
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,520
much about active members because i

1585
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,119
figured everybody else had kind of done

1586
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,440
it pretty fairly um the use cases first

1587
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,040
your first question um use kids we're

1588
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,480
looking at are things that are just

1589
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
beyond um the ability of uh current

1590
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,559
robotics um the idea here is this

1591
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,480
software could be put on you know any

1592
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,400
old robot and kind of provide you know

1593
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,160
um adaptive capabilities for certain

1594
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,680
things um

1595
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,280
you know we're pretty open-ended in

1596
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,480
terms of what we're looking at in terms

1597
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,559
of use cases uh right now our current

1598
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,280
uses are in like um uh

1599
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,680
uh energy uh and manufacturing uh

1600
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,319
particularly um this is a fair amount of

1601
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:39,440
stuff that still has to be done by

1602
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,520
humans that could be pretty easily uh

1603
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,280
moved into robots um

1604
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,040
if they had you know a little bit more

1605
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,760
capability uh and then in terms of how

1606
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,680
does uh the homeostatic networks kind of

1607
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,079
fit into the active inference uh

1608
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,280
framework in general and i kind of

1609
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,200
touched on it a little bit in terms of

1610
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,359
how this uh these ultra stable nodes

1611
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,440
work in the framework of homeostasis uh

1612
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,359
if you kind of think of homeostasis as

1613
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,040
the network trying to seek you know

1614
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,520
global equilibrium um what this means

1615
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,359
from the ultrastable nodes point of view

1616
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,799
it means that it's um it's uh its local

1617
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,359
output state is is zero and that local

1618
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,319
output state is um the result of an

1619
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,000
accumulation process of this linear

1620
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,760
transformation so the idea here is this

1621
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,359
ultra stable node what it's doing is

1622
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,280
it's doing a search it's doing a search

1623
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,799
through linear what are the right linear

1624
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,440
transformations that make my local uh

1625
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,760
state go to zero uh and so in that

1626
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,599
context you can kind of think of every

1627
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,680
time the um the ultra stable node

1628
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,240
updates its local linear transformations

1629
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,079
um this is updating its local model of

1630
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,079
the world and making a new guess about

1631
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,720
how the real world works uh and whether

1632
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,640
or not that's useful for the purpose of

1633
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,640
global prediction you know it depends on

1634
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,480
whether or not it makes that local uh

1635
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,079
value go to zero so there's there's a

1636
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,400
lot of threads here in terms of um

1637
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,280
expectations and um and

1638
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,400
you know prediction error flowing

1639
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,640
through the network um but it's a much

1640
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,480
more distributed process like it's and

1641
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,520
it's much less clear like um what each

1642
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,760
node is is what part of the model each

1643
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,280
node has taken place because you know

1644
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,280
each node in the network uh when it's

1645
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,640
changing its linear transformation what

1646
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,680
it's actually doing is slightly

1647
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,920
redefining all the feedback loops in all

1648
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,680
the of all the sub networks in the

1649
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,520
network it's in all the loops that flow

1650
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,280
through that node it's making a small

1651
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,480
change to so

1652
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,720
um each node in a certain way then has

1653
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,799
effect on all the other networks uh that

1654
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,319
are connected through its feedback loops

1655
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,839
and all those other nodes also have

1656
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,760
impact on its uh signals that are

1657
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,200
flowing through it uh and this is this

1658
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,039
reciprocal process that kind of builds

1659
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,400
this generative model i'm not sure if

1660
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,640
that's particularly helpful

1661
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,559
yeah that's great um if i could make one

1662
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,480
more comment question then we'll bring

1663
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,119
adam saffron on in just a minute or two

1664
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,599
the letter that you showed was quite

1665
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,960
interesting

1666
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,760
and

1667
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,520
i got the sense of this like

1668
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,680
multi-generational titanic clash between

1669
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,359
what you described as infinite

1670
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,720
computation

1671
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,880
in the discrete setting with the turing

1672
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,559
tape and then infinite adaptation in the

1673
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,119
continuous setting with the generalized

1674
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,000
cybernetics and so i think that's a very

1675
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,240
fascinating framing because what do

1676
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,520
people say about computers and

1677
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,359
continuous time systems we're going to

1678
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,039
have to discretize

1679
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,839
and so the implementation is stepwise

1680
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,280
and that's what allows us to like

1681
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,520
actually implement it on hard drives and

1682
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,359
cpus and so on with the von neumann

1683
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,000
architecture but then also in the

1684
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
background or like even the water that

1685
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,880
we swim in is this continuous time the

1686
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,359
real time unfolding of perception

1687
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,200
cognition action outside the sandwich

1688
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,599
model outside of the discrete time

1689
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,839
yeah i i i'm really glad to pick up on

1690
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,839
that i wish i was more qualified to

1691
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,520
speak on such topics i'm a computer

1692
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,440
scientist so i i don't want to speak too

1693
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,520
far outside my field um but yeah i think

1694
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,200
you hit the nail on the head of my gut

1695
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,680
instinct on it you know

1696
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,680
um all right we'll take just a short

1697
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,119
break and then come right back with adam

1698
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,119
saffron

1699
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,400
all right welcome back everyone

1700
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,480
we are continuing on

1701
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,960
with adam saffron generalized

1702
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,280
simultaneous localization and mapping

1703
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,599
gslam as a unification framework for

1704
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,079
natural and artificial intelligences so

1705
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,720
adam thanks a lot for joining and please

1706
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,279
take it away

1707
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,000
um thank you daniel so hello everyone

1708
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,520
i'm adam saffron i am a research fellow

1709
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,400
at

1710
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,640
the johns hopkins university school of

1711
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,319
medicine at their

1712
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,319
center for psychedelic consciousness

1713
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,680
research

1714
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,960
and today i will be discussing

1715
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,240
a grand unified theory

1716
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,240
another one

1717
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,240
but before i do um as was previously

1718
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,640
mentioned and as is probably of interest

1719
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,440
to

1720
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,760
people watching this i recently

1721
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,079
co-organized a special issue of

1722
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,280
frontiers in neuro robotics with

1723
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,799
inescipito and andy clark

1724
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,720
most of the submissions are already in

1725
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,480
for you to read and

1726
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,200
that will be closing up soon

1727
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,520
there's also another special issue

1728
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,640
that i am co-organizing with other

1729
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,200
active inferencers and fristonians

1730
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,240
for royal society interface focus

1731
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,880
on the subject of symmetries in mind and

1732
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,119
life broadly construed

1733
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,400
ranging from

1734
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,559
symmetry breaking and dynamical systems

1735
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:49,440
to

1736
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,359
a gauge theoretic formulation of the

1737
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,200
free energy principle

1738
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,640
this is actively soliciting

1739
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,359
contributions and so please contact me

1740
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,440
if you have anything along those lines

1741
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,400
so

1742
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,200
uh in this work and throughout all of it

1743
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,240
uh

1744
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,680
my journey i've been trying to

1745
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,039
understand the basis of autonomy and

1746
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,559
biological and artificial systems um

1747
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,039
do we have free will how does that work

1748
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,880
could we build autonomous agents that

1749
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,440
work like we do and have our capacities

1750
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,640
these are the kinds of questions that

1751
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,039
have motivated me

1752
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,200
towards this end i have been

1753
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,400
working on some

1754
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,960
fairly ambitious projects such as

1755
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,039
a theory of consciousness that tries to

1756
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,960
bring together various theories

1757
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,400
within the free energy principle and

1758
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,720
active inference framework

1759
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,920
and also

1760
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,440
models of free will

1761
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,359
in terms of the micro mechanics of

1762
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,720
agency

1763
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,039
across all of this work i take what i've

1764
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,480
called a

1765
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,720
marian neurophenomenological approach or

1766
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,400
a neil seth calls it computational

1767
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,079
neurophenomenology which

1768
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,480
i think is a better name uh and roughly

1769
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,720
the idea is you take the core aspects of

1770
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,440
experience um seriously

1771
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,920
as fundamental things to explain

1772
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,839
and then you cross-reference this with a

1773
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,760
multi-level uh

1774
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,440
functionalist handling or a marion

1775
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,400
handling

1776
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
where you can simultaneously analyze the

1777
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,599
system on

1778
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,520
computational or functional levels with

1779
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,920
the system um what the different aspects

1780
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,439
are for their their adaptive

1781
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,679
significance what their

1782
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,520
the function they're serving this

1783
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,000
algorithmic level the abstract way

1784
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,719
the specific programs and operations by

1785
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,158
which this is achieved

1786
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,839
and the implementational level or the

1787
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,839
physical realization of these and so the

1788
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:37,120
idea is you take this multi-stack under

1789
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,238
um understanding of cognitive systems

1790
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,880
and you cross reference this with um

1791
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,560
phenomenology taking experience

1792
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,319
seriously and this is my general

1793
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,600
approach and uh active inference um with

1794
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,040
its associated process theories

1795
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,120
basically checks boxes across all those

1796
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,000
levels

1797
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,439
you have the free energy principle you

1798
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:56,640
have active inference and you have

1799
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,080
predictive coding

1800
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,560
and these various

1801
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,520
claims of different degrees of

1802
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,600
specificity really help to flush out

1803
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,839
this mutually constraining multi-level

1804
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:08,080
account of cognition

1805
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:08,799
but

1806
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,640
more recently i have been collaborating

1807
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,799
with roboticists

1808
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,279
and here are two particularly excellent

1809
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,560
bio-bots tim verbalin and ozin kathal

1810
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,560
and um a lot of these journeys uh we

1811
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,040
encountered each other and um

1812
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,600
there's increasing interest in

1813
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,198
uh machine learning and artificial

1814
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,880
intelligence and things like artificial

1815
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,158
consciousness

1816
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,000
you'll have people like bengio talking

1817
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,399
about system two cognition and more um

1818
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,000
recently even lacuna's been starting to

1819
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,520
take these things on

1820
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,560
uh with um his jepa architecture talking

1821
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,080
about world models

1822
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,679
of different kinds and how they might

1823
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,120
serve the functions of artificial

1824
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,399
consciousness

1825
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,479
um but for my collaboration with tim and

1826
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,719
ozin we've mostly been focused

1827
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,920
on the specific problem of navigation

1828
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,000
um specifically a problem known as

1829
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,880
simultaneous localization and mapping

1830
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,760
uh roughly the idea here is that um

1831
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,920
where am i in space

1832
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,840
and what kind of space is this

1833
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,840
this is a fundamental question for any

1834
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,520
active inference system any cybernetic

1835
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,480
system

1836
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,719
um but there's a kind of a problem here

1837
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:15,920
and that

1838
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,080
you're trying to map out the space

1839
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,920
and situate yourself in it in the same

1840
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,800
time simultaneously so but to map out

1841
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,239
the space it helps to know where you are

1842
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,440
in the space but to know where you are

1843
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,280
in the space it helps to help to have a

1844
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,800
good map of that space

1845
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,640
and so there's various proposals for

1846
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,719
different ways of bootstrapping yourself

1847
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,239
to degrees of certainty of

1848
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,239
what kind of maps or models are adequate

1849
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,840
for situating you

1850
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,360
in the world

1851
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,960
in a particular location and this is

1852
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,719
going to be important whether you're a

1853
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:45,840
robot

1854
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
navigating through the world or an

1855
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,000
animal foraging for value

1856
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,840
you got to know where you are

1857
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,920
to know what to do

1858
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,840
so

1859
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,520
more recently

1860
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,600
in this collaboration

1861
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,360
which i've really found to be amazing

1862
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,400
because uh i just i'm in awe of robotics

1863
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,600
and what they can do it's kind of like

1864
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,760
that feynman quote of what i cannot

1865
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,400
build i would i

1866
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,760
cannot build i do not understand well

1867
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,120
they live that that's just what they do

1868
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,040
all day long they're like introspecting

1869
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,199
how do i work they're going into theory

1870
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,320
and then they're actually building a

1871
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,080
system in this back and forth iterative

1872
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,440
process and so

1873
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,360
the collaboration here was i'm looking

1874
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,320
at what ways can um biological systems

1875
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,920
and specifically focusing on the

1876
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,840
hippocampal system what ways can these

1877
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,640
inform navigation problems

1878
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,560
um in this more recent paper that i'm

1879
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,080
going to be focusing on more today

1880
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:36,880
called

1881
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,120
generalized simultaneous localization

1882
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,040
mapping or gslam

1883
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,280
we're reversing the flow a bit and the

1884
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,239
idea is

1885
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,679
more than

1886
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,199
cognitive neuroscience and forming

1887
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,560
robotics

1888
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,120
it's looking more to robotics to inform

1889
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,880
cognitive neuroscience basically

1890
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,360
leveraging the the precision they have

1891
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,880
with characterizing these problems and

1892
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,320
the way they're in touch with the ground

1893
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,280
truth of

1894
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,600
engineering and physical moving systems

1895
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,719
in the world

1896
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,440
um using this to inform cognitive

1897
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,719
neuroscience

1898
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,280
and specifically the claim is that this

1899
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,960
slam problem is fundamental and that it

1900
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,280
may have structured a uh surprisingly

1901
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,360
maybe shockingly broad range of

1902
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,600
cognitive processes and that this might

1903
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,159
be a fundamental a source of fundamental

1904
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,600
principles for

1905
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,920
understanding how high-level cognition

1906
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,159
was achieved with high-level put in some

1907
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,159
scare quotes but the idea is the things

1908
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,679
that

1909
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,880
humans seem to be or animals seem to be

1910
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,320
particularly capable of doing relative

1911
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,920
artificial systems and humans in some

1912
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,360
ways even more so

1913
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,320
and the properties we want to

1914
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,080
recapitulate in artificial intelligence

1915
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,760
and machine learning

1916
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,480
uh so some precedent for this um came

1917
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,640
from work with ratslam

1918
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,640
a seminal work by um milford wyatt and

1919
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,239
praiser so

1920
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,719
i'm in this they uh look to the

1921
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,360
the rat in this hippocampus and look at

1922
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,440
look at its wayfinding and navigation

1923
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,320
abilities and try to um basically

1924
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,320
reverse engineer these uh there's a

1925
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,080
really um excellent youtube video that

1926
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,320
i'll post um i've watched it countless

1927
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,800
times which just summarizes this process

1928
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,280
of building up rat slam from like these

1929
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,360
initial foundations of the ambition

1930
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,800
and folding in more and more details

1931
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,000
finding you know this isn't quite

1932
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,880
working going back to the biology going

1933
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,960
back to engineering and then actually

1934
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,440
showing systems that um

1935
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,520
do the same things as biological systems

1936
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,600
inspired by those systems it's extremely

1937
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,920
compelling um it kind of like you know

1938
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,199
every time i watch that video i feel

1939
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,360
like i get something new i wonder is are

1940
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,520
these the steps that nature took and

1941
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,360
evolving these systems i also kind of

1942
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,199
felt like what have i been doing with my

1943
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,560
life all this time like why didn't i

1944
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,239
find roboticists sooner and started

1945
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,440
talking to them

1946
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,120
um so i'm very grateful to be part of

1947
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,560
this symposium

1948
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,679
uh

1949
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,440
leighton and very grateful for uh tim

1950
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,560
and ozin

1951
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,679
and so

1952
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,719
with their work with leighton slam uh

1953
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,560
what they're doing is they're

1954
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,239
tackling the slam problem using active

1955
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,000
inference i'm not going to go into all

1956
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,159
the details here but some of this was

1957
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,000
discussed um there's parallels with some

1958
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,120
of the architectures they were discussed

1959
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,199
previously and tim touched on this

1960
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,679
so you basically have an agent moving

1961
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,120
through the world that has a variety of

1962
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
views of what it's expecting to see and

1963
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,239
poses

1964
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,800
and this experience map is a trajectory

1965
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,320
of the agent

1966
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,360
through

1967
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,600
space and time and then here would be a

1968
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,199
generative model description in the

1969
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,880
middle of this where you have these

1970
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,760
conjunctions of posing of poses and

1971
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,280
views which are unfolding um in this

1972
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,760
series of transitions um adaptively

1973
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,040
sculpted sculpted via your policies

1974
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,120
but where there's this upper level which

1975
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,280
is basically organizing this as spatial

1976
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,760
temporal trajectories situating you in

1977
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,560
some kind of map or graph of space

1978
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,920
and uh

1979
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,960
this

1980
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,800
conjunction of pose and view um one of

1981
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,239
the places i found to be compelling is

1982
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,480
that um i've arrived at these as

1983
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,120
basically the primary modalities i focus

1984
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,040
on just from like looking at the systems

1985
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,679
neuroscience but this um happens to be

1986
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,360
the primary things that are focused on

1987
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,120
for helping a robot to move through the

1988
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,719
world and a

1989
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,679
pose and view um and basically for

1990
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,920
neuroscience i focus a lot on systems

1991
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,360
such as the pecunius as potentially um

1992
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,360
enabling something like a mind's eye and

1993
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,719
the lateral prior courtesies of

1994
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:23,920
something like a live body and that

1995
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,000
these would couple very closely and that

1996
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,360
would make some sense since your pose

1997
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,360
would inform your view and vice versa

1998
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,199
but there's another detail you need for

1999
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,199
this to be an autonomous system an

2000
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,600
adaptive agent which is um not just like

2001
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,360
what's where is my body and what am i

2002
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,679
seeing but where am i in space where do

2003
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:40,960
i want to go

2004
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,040
relative to the world and the various

2005
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:43,840
things

2006
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,920
that i believe are in the world how do i

2007
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,320
pursue my goals in the world and so

2008
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,840
enter uh the slam problem

2009
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,880
um but

2010
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,360
what's built with latent slam this is a

2011
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,120
you know this is a very impressive

2012
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,719
architecture um some details were

2013
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,719
described below which you know

2014
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,800
all these things governed by a singular

2015
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,320
objective function

2016
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,880
where the agent is able to

2017
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,199
not just um uh make its way through the

2018
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,199
world but also it's this powerful

2019
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,360
self-supervised learning curriculum as

2020
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,840
you're moving the two views views and

2021
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,640
pose and landmarks each one providing a

2022
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,400
source of predictions for the other

2023
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,920
training up the other

2024
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,719
um helping you to uh get a grip on the

2025
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,080
world

2026
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,280
uh

2027
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,159
in terms of slam um two of the things

2028
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,880
that um so this like broader notion of g

2029
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,199
of g slam or generalized language this

2030
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,480
would be a way of thinking of high level

2031
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,159
cognition um i'm particularly interested

2032
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,159
in uh

2033
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:44,640
these two operations one's called

2034
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,560
loop closure and the other is

2035
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,880
graph relaxation no duplication i guess

2036
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,280
that's three but the idea is um as to

2037
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,000
mention when an agent finds itself in a

2038
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,080
situation where its pose and view are

2039
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,239
highly similar to something to what was

2040
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,400
previously encountered uh this affords a

2041
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,719
potentially unique opportunity you now

2042
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,719
think you know where you are in space

2043
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,159
and so this is a really good opportunity

2044
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,360
to update your experience map and so

2045
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,480
this

2046
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,080
coming back around

2047
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,280
it's not just a good opportunity in

2048
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,600
terms of you have high confidence but it

2049
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,320
creates a closed system so you closed a

2050
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,199
loop

2051
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,480
um

2052
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,080
and so you basically have these

2053
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,560
different equilibrium points in this

2054
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,120
graph um which can be thought of as a

2055
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,640
map also but basically because they're

2056
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,400
all chained together um these are

2057
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,840
sometimes modeled as like energetic

2058
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,400
spring systems and they're all mutually

2059
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,640
informing and constraining one another

2060
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,040
and so when you find yourself with a

2061
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,719
loop closure event where you you're in

2062
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,800
this highly familiar state

2063
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,800
you then take this as an opportunity to

2064
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,400
refine your map and so you you know uh

2065
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,560
will do a very fine if if you're within

2066
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,600
a certain margin of error of um

2067
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,360
a location

2068
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,920
then if you think you're you really got

2069
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,640
it

2070
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,520
um

2071
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,760
you'll then take the overall map and re

2072
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,520
and relax and you'll basically

2073
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,000
move around the various dependencies of

2074
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,960
different nodes um in space the

2075
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,120
different landmarks to adjust them and

2076
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,719
have each one refine the other and form

2077
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,400
the other however

2078
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,080
if you're past some threshold for

2079
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,679
similarity and it looks like you're

2080
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:18,960
close but not quite there you're a

2081
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,480
little bit different

2082
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,360
uh

2083
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,440
if you're surprised then you'll

2084
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,640
duplicate the node and then you'll

2085
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,640
create a new landmark and so now you'll

2086
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,000
have a new graph and so this is

2087
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
basically a kind of structure learning

2088
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,760
and there's a lot of work in bayesian

2089
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,000
cognitive science on um and within

2090
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,440
active inference a lot of open work like

2091
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,080
how do we effectively do

2092
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,760
structure learning for handling complex

2093
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,520
domains and

2094
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,280
i'm suggesting and uh i think timothy um

2095
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,880
hopefully would agree especially so

2096
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,280
writing together uh would be that um

2097
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,480
this provides a principled basis for

2098
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,840
doing uh structural learning uh what's

2099
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,000
interesting here though um in this

2100
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,600
diagram that tim made

2101
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,880
is that

2102
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,560
as you're mapping out this warehouse

2103
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,600
here

2104
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,840
if you set these thresholds for uh

2105
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,840
identifying a node differently if if

2106
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,239
your graph relaxation no duplication

2107
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,159
thresholds are set differently you get

2108
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,840
very different models or maps you might

2109
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,159
get very different structures or if you

2110
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,719
will schemas or scripts

2111
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,440
uh that's not the frame in terms of a

2112
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,199
slam problem but the claim here is that

2113
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,080
basically these the hippocampal uh

2114
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,480
supposed place fields provide a basis

2115
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,280
for

2116
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,320
um

2117
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,480
structure representations many of which

2118
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,920
have resemblances the kinds of things

2119
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,199
that were hoped for in like good

2120
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,040
old-fashioned cognitive science

2121
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,239
and a neurosymbolic ai um and so some of

2122
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,000
and and part of what's hoped for is some

2123
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
of the um aspects of potentially

2124
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,280
uniquely human cognition high-level

2125
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,280
cognition high level

2126
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,040
um

2127
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,840
are

2128
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,159
require some sort of representational

2129
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,080
scheme but if you set these parent but

2130
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,520
if this is the mean by which you arrive

2131
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,719
at representations and if these

2132
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,719
parameters set differently could give

2133
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,199
you um wildly different representations

2134
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,719
these would have very different impacts

2135
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,400
on the kinds of minds you might have

2136
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,080
potentially including even things like

2137
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,679
cognitive spectrums if you were to apply

2138
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,360
this to a biological domain

2139
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,880
and so there's some notion that for

2140
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,800
instance you could even potentially

2141
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,639
think of these parameters for the

2142
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,600
hippocampal system um which are maybe

2143
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,320
evolutionarily were originally

2144
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,000
laid down as parameters for this for a

2145
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,520
slam problem for an animal finding

2146
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,800
itself in the world

2147
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,760
but where

2148
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,239
the continued operate in terms of um the

2149
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,480
mechanisms of hippocampal and internal

2150
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,080
plasticity

2151
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,960
that

2152
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,639
these if they're parameterized

2153
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:38,400
differently in different people could

2154
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,400
give you very different kinds of minds

2155
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,920
and this potentially has very um

2156
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,360
the significance of this might be

2157
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,719
difficult to overstate in terms of

2158
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,000
characterizing human difference these

2159
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,280
might be some of the most important

2160
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,400
variables

2161
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,159
you could look at for saying how people

2162
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,120
differ

2163
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,800
in the way they relate to knowledge in

2164
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,040
the world and not just so this would

2165
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,360
have clinical consequences basic science

2166
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,120
consequences maybe even

2167
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,480
helping to explain some of uniquely

2168
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,080
human cognition the kinds of things that

2169
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,520
help to get um

2170
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,199
symbolic uh

2171
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,800
reasoning and like cumulative culture

2172
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,800
off the ground

2173
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,679
uh

2174
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:12,960
there's other proposals that are kind of

2175
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,360
similar to some mad dog

2176
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,800
navigation perspective or slam

2177
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,080
perspective

2178
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,960
uh jeff hawkins out of numenta has a

2179
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,719
proposal he calls a thousand brains

2180
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:23,920
theory technically it should be called

2181
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,960
something more like a hundred thousand

2182
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,520
brains theory um where the idea is that

2183
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,199
there's a common cortical algorithm

2184
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,120
carried out by every single cortical

2185
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,239
column

2186
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,560
of doing this um object modeling and

2187
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,639
navigation of the kindness described

2188
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,880
with the kaplanatorinal system

2189
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,560
um

2190
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,000
i i find aspects of this to be

2191
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,600
compelling but also very mixed feelings

2192
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,719
and i can talk about that later with

2193
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,320
anyone who's interested

2194
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,159
uh there's another recent proposal in

2195
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,840
this spirit by chris fields and michael

2196
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,719
levin

2197
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,880
where they're basically characterizing

2198
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,040
morphogenesis as cells engaging in a

2199
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,440
kind of way finding a navigation process

2200
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,360
of where they ought to be

2201
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,520
in this um synchronization manifold of

2202
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,360
the phenotype and so they're all finding

2203
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,800
their place you know singing as karma

2204
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,840
might say like singing from the common

2205
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,080
hem sheet knowing where they are but as

2206
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,280
as they're synchronizing they're moving

2207
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,920
around to find where they are this uh

2208
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,520
unfolding geometric melody that

2209
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,719
eventually becomes the phenotype of the

2210
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,040
organism but the idea is that this

2211
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,400
intelligence of wayfinding at the

2212
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,000
cellular level

2213
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,360
many of these mechanisms may have been

2214
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,679
repurposed and recycled and deployed

2215
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,679
differently for overt navigation and

2216
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,840
that this is a frame for intelligence

2217
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,600
more generally i found this to be

2218
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,239
extremely compelling although what i'm

2219
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,600
doing with this work is i'm focusing

2220
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,040
more on the hippocampal enter rhino

2221
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,520
system as a source of specific

2222
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,000
adaptations with specific properties and

2223
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,639
a major transition unit and evolution

2224
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,639
potentially also of some connection to

2225
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:45,920
things like um

2226
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,679
ginsberg and jablanca's

2227
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,920
major transition markers and unlimited

2228
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,400
associated learning um they have a lot

2229
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,000
of emphasis on hippocampal system and

2230
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,080
its homologs there's very interesting

2231
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,600
work that i'm only beginning to look

2232
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,000
into in the insect

2233
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,440
and insects with

2234
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,040
the central complex and the mushroom

2235
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,239
bodies and the way they handle

2236
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,719
navigation i i think cross-referencing

2237
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,800
the mammalian version and the insect

2238
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,639
version would be really invaluable and

2239
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,920
that's like that's a

2240
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,679
a major to do that i'm hoping daniel

2241
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,040
will help me with

2242
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:15,920
so

2243
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,800
uh

2244
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,400
some other precedence would be in terms

2245
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,400
of this idea of generalized navigation

2246
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,760
that this would be a powerful frame for

2247
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,920
understanding cognition uh comes from

2248
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,880
some older work with hasabis and maguire

2249
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,000
they found interestingly that

2250
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,920
hippocampal patients not only are they

2251
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,600
impaired in episodic

2252
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,280
memory but they have trouble with

2253
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,159
episodic imaginings of counter factuals

2254
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,719
of novel situations and so they talked

2255
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,080
about this construction system of the

2256
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,840
spring this core system for memory and

2257
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,719
imagining allowing for various forms of

2258
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,040
um sophisticated modeling and creative

2259
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,360
cognition and this seems to have been

2260
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,679
part of what basically gave demis the

2261
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,360
the confidence to go and found deep mind

2262
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,800
and this is still a core aspect of what

2263
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,080
they're doing there

2264
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,840
and and the race is on for reverse

2265
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,679
engineering the system and the race is

2266
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,920
heating up and some really excellent

2267
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,000
work would come from uh timothy barron's

2268
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,440
group um i believe he's still at ucl um

2269
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,520
they're showing like for instance uh

2270
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,639
there's an architecture called the

2271
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,639
tolman eichenbaum machine which i

2272
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,639
strongly recommend checking out um

2273
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:18,880
that's uh active inference compliant and

2274
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,800
as a realization of the functioning type

2275
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,120
of campus system they don't focus

2276
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,120
as much on navigation although it can be

2277
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,040
used for that and that's part of it that

2278
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,800
the um

2279
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,320
i'll come back in a second for the

2280
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,000
differences here but um when in this

2281
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,360
work one thing

2282
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,040
of note is so

2283
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,800
they're showing basically people

2284
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,199
categorizing these stimuli um where you

2285
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,480
have these birds with different length

2286
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,719
necks and there's a kind of morpho space

2287
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,159
in terms of characterizing the the

2288
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,480
features and the various dimensions and

2289
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,159
basically they're showing hippocampal

2290
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,239
slash end to rhino-like representations

2291
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,320
grid-like representations

2292
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,760
um

2293
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,760
being involved in helping to map out

2294
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,600
this feature space and so this is one

2295
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,760
example that's very commonly cited of

2296
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,840
spatialized cognition or something that

2297
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,320
might not seem clearly spatial but then

2298
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,920
the idea of gsum would be once we've

2299
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,440
spatialized it

2300
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,679
then to what degree in our sense making

2301
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,280
is it actually kind of navigation

2302
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,560
through the space

2303
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,639
and so this process of spatializing and

2304
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,280
navigating through the space

2305
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,719
simultaneously i would call that a slam

2306
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,280
problem and i think a lot of cognition

2307
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,000
can be fruitfully framed in this way and

2308
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,520
i'm going to go a little further so

2309
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,960
here's the tolman i can bomb machine and

2310
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,360
he's showing like different um

2311
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,199
i don't know is his face covered by the

2312
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,719
thing i can't tell

2313
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,719
uh well there he is

2314
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,920
okay yeah so his work is unbelievable um

2315
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,560
his group and um

2316
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,400
but you know different things like uh

2317
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,440
relations among people within uh

2318
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,239
hierarchical um tree structures of their

2319
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,920
relations uh doing things like

2320
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,159
transitive inference of one property

2321
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,440
related to another and a set of

2322
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,280
dependencies but basically

2323
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,400
using the hippocampal systems properties

2324
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,600
to navigate navigate and manipulate

2325
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,239
these spatialized representations

2326
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:07,120
um there's other work from deep mind um

2327
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,480
there's this other talk highly

2328
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,560
recommended by um statchenfeld at all at

2329
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,560
the main conference it's unbelievable

2330
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,960
talk uh talking about the the recent

2331
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,120
work from deepmind to reverse engineered

2332
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,199
hippocampal systems uh

2333
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:20,719
place cells and the grid cells of the

2334
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,400
entourinal system as allowing for um

2335
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,719
a variety of properties

2336
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,679
um

2337
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,120
some of

2338
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,880
you know

2339
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,480
very similar to baron's work and they

2340
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,199
collaborate together

2341
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,400
but one thing that's interesting about

2342
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,520
this talk

2343
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,760
is um

2344
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,679
she makes a point that this isn't just

2345
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,360
um for tasks that are like physical

2346
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,159
space this isn't necessarily spatial um

2347
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,440
i might uh

2348
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,320
challenge that a bit um and and and say

2349
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,639
that um we should basically always have

2350
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,560
a prior of looking for the spatial

2351
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,760
properties

2352
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,159
of any task domain and then wondering to

2353
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,840
what degree can we frame this as a slam

2354
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,800
problem

2355
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,880
and i think there's maybe two reasons of

2356
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,560
doing for doing this

2357
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,360
uh

2358
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,960
one uh maybe three uh one is that um

2359
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,800
basically putting things into a common

2360
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,199
framework helps to

2361
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,840
you to draw analogies across um

2362
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,719
seemingly heterogeneous um domains and

2363
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,800
this can be a source of insight in terms

2364
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,199
of a common representational framework

2365
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,080
um

2366
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,239
for sense meaning sense making gives you

2367
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,560
an ability to

2368
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,080
have creative combinations from

2369
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,320
seemingly different domains so

2370
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,520
but the other reason is um

2371
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,040
the hippocampal system like this was

2372
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,800
specifically probably what it was

2373
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,120
selected for this is a mapping system

2374
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,520
for a animal foraging through value

2375
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,199
through various spaces

2376
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,639
and this isn't just evolutionary but

2377
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,960
this is also developmentally and ongoing

2378
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,960
this is an ongoing problem we have not

2379
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,199
transcended this we are still in space

2380
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:56,719
we still constantly have to move through

2381
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,000
space and situate ourselves through

2382
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,320
spaces physical spaces and also

2383
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,840
conceptual spaces that's part of the

2384
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,920
reason i'm really emphasizing the slam

2385
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,920
framing because hippocampal system will

2386
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,159
never lose this job description

2387
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,239
and this the idea is that understanding

2388
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,679
the ways in which is parameterized

2389
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,400
specific operas operationalizations

2390
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,920
i don't think that's a word

2391
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,960
um

2392
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,600
it's essential to keep in mind this

2393
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,360
ecological significance and so this is

2394
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,040
all within the spirit of um i guess a

2395
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,800
broader view in cognitive science called

2396
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,280
ecological rationality which is go back

2397
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,880
to the origins

2398
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,120
and try to understand it's tim bergen's

2399
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,800
quote nothing in biology makes sense

2400
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,199
except of the light of evolution take

2401
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:38,000
that very seriously and run with it

2402
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,199
um

2403
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:41,280
one other thing that's uh so alongside

2404
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,360
one thing i can get is connections one

2405
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,960
thing a g slam perspective gets you is

2406
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,960
connections to forging theory

2407
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,280
and so um

2408
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,280
you know if you're thinking of an animal

2409
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,560
going through the world trying to

2410
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,000
extract value

2411
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,560
resources are often patchy and so as

2412
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,719
you're moving through the world you uh

2413
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,000
might be you know

2414
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,760
balancing expiration and exploitation

2415
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,600
with respect if you find a patch might

2416
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,960
be good to exploit that for a bit if

2417
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,960
it's particularly juicy but then as that

2418
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,880
patch dries up maybe it's time to go

2419
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,199
explore and then you want to move

2420
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,040
between adaptively move between phases

2421
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,040
of exploration exploitation staying

2422
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,040
longer in some places and then moving to

2423
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,600
other places and so these um jumps other

2424
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,280
places like when a patch starts to dry

2425
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,639
up and these are sometimes known as

2426
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,960
levee flights and

2427
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,719
this is playing actually into some of my

2428
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,880
work in psychedelics and that um

2429
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,400
informed by some really intriguing

2430
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,880
suggestions from matt shine's group uh

2431
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,880
the idea is that one of the mechanisms

2432
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,080
impacted

2433
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,199
by psychedelics might be um

2434
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,199
potentially facilitating these kinds of

2435
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,679
levy flights where you can think of more

2436
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,440
creative cognition as involving more

2437
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:50,320
exploration more broad associations

2438
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,719
and there's all and

2439
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,199
forging theory uh you know it's it's

2440
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,280
extremely rich and well developed uh

2441
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,800
there's all sorts of different modes of

2442
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,080
foraging that could be thought of as

2443
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,000
different modes of cognition there's

2444
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,679
specific hypotheses and connections to

2445
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,600
formalisms like the marginal value

2446
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,880
theorem so you would have like a

2447
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,679
hypothesis like when do you leave

2448
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:11,199
well in the marginal value theorem that

2449
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,960
is you leave a pact or when you when you

2450
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,880
go and try to find the new you leave a

2451
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:15,760
patch

2452
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,520
when the average when your current

2453
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,600
estimated value drops below what you

2454
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,120
think the average rate of return should

2455
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,000
be so this then you know gives you um

2456
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,600
basically like you can now characterize

2457
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,040
people where are they relative to these

2458
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,520
different normative models

2459
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,320
um and you know this idea

2460
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,239
maybe has an even older vintage or maybe

2461
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:35,679
you know newer relative evolution but

2462
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:38,080
old relative to discourses in terms of

2463
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,920
the art of memory and the art of memory

2464
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,920
and the method of loci you know memory

2465
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,760
especially before we wrote everything

2466
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,280
down or when writing things out was

2467
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,480
expensive

2468
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,639
and even now to have something in your

2469
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,639
mind where you know it could be at hand

2470
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,000
where you can retrieve it to have like a

2471
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,880
well-curated set of of knowledge it's

2472
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
essential and so one of the best tricks

2473
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,440
that were discovered is you actively

2474
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,280
intentionally spatialize your knowledge

2475
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,840
you actually create a physical place

2476
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,600
that you visualize and you move through

2477
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,239
it

2478
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,480
and at each place you at each point in

2479
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,080
this space you've placed different

2480
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,520
things you want to remember

2481
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,360
and part of the reason this likely works

2482
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,080
so well like almost certainly is this is

2483
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,520
um you know

2484
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,760
the core of memory in the campus system

2485
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,400
is actually involving a process of

2486
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,920
um

2487
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,760
it is a spatial mapper that's something

2488
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,199
i would argue

2489
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,440
uh there's connection to some other more

2490
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,639
cognitive science i'm not going to get

2491
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:31,520
into right now but like

2492
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,159
multi-dimensional scaling where you

2493
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,080
understand potentially complex domains

2494
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,600
by mapping them onto a more a simpler

2495
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,520
and potentially more

2496
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,840
cognitively navigable space

2497
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,159
and then

2498
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:49,679
i'm not going to get into this right now

2499
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:50,800
but um

2500
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,480
actually i will so

2501
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,120
real quick aside is with respect to

2502
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,199
multi-dimensional scaling one of the

2503
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,120
early things that got people excited for

2504
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,040
about it was it's potentially used for

2505
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,280
analogical reasoning or establishing

2506
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,199
similarities between domains it's a very

2507
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,880
important thing to know like how similar

2508
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,320
is something relative to something else

2509
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,760
like should these things be placed in

2510
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,960
the same category or um

2511
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,120
you know it's

2512
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,320
and

2513
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,600
one way of doing this was saying what is

2514
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,000
the distance in this when you do

2515
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,760
multi-dimensional scaling and you place

2516
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,280
something in a feature space what is the

2517
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,800
distance between these between different

2518
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,679
things

2519
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:28,480
and

2520
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,159
the further apart the less similar they

2521
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:30,960
are

2522
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,400
but there are other models of analogical

2523
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,560
reasoning and there's another race on to

2524
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,320
try to figure out how we do analogical

2525
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,239
reasoning and so some of these proposals

2526
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:39,600
um you know they would go on beyond

2527
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,520
something like um multi-dimensional

2528
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,880
scaling but they involve specific

2529
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,719
structure representations

2530
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:46,080
but then we have a question what's the

2531
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,000
ontological status of such things do

2532
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,520
they actually exist in the minds we do

2533
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,679
actually have representations or maybe

2534
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,679
these things are more like they're

2535
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,440
virtualized or inactively realized or

2536
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,000
implicitly i suspect they probably we

2537
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,239
probably um many of the the kinds of

2538
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,679
structures you know

2539
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:02,719
described in good old-fashioned

2540
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,159
cognitive science might not be

2541
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,080
biologically plausible but they might be

2542
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,320
surprisingly biological plausible if you

2543
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,400
actually have a system capable of

2544
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,280
adaptively constructing graphs

2545
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,440
based on um

2546
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,760
your ability to extract value from these

2547
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,520
graphs and situate things relative to

2548
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,360
other things and so it's possible that

2549
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,800
some of analogical reasoning and even

2550
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,960
causal reasoning could be unlocked by

2551
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,719
having a good means

2552
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,480
of um

2553
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,239
creating structured representations and

2554
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,280
one of the things that the capital

2555
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,440
system might seem to be able to do is

2556
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,800
create these graphs where the different

2557
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,080
place cells of the

2558
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,159
campus can be thought of as nodes and so

2559
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,159
if you duplicate a node you are now

2560
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,239
basically doing structure learning um

2561
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,880
you can you have you're complexifying

2562
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,760
this uh representation

2563
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,920
uh so this comes into my uh work in

2564
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,320
other ways such as um models of

2565
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,480
goal-oriented behavior i'm not gonna get

2566
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,320
into too many details right now but here

2567
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,159
would be the campus system and you see

2568
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,639
um based on work of people like reddish

2569
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:01,440
that

2570
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,600
and also um like sam gershman has a

2571
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,239
successor representation uh model but

2572
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,560
basically you'll see these predictive

2573
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,480
campuses a predictive map or what's

2574
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,000
being predicted is

2575
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,600
um where you'll see these sweeps of

2576
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,120
activity that will proceed in front of

2577
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,360
the animal before and then which will

2578
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,280
predict which choice we'll do what arm

2579
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,199
of a maze in my coda

2580
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,159
and so

2581
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,920
the idea is that the hippocampal system

2582
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,400
is the top of the cortical hierarchy

2583
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,560
and that any prediction errors that are

2584
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,800
not handled elsewhere end up get

2585
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,480
temporarily stored

2586
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,920
in this volatile uh memory system which

2587
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,120
is also

2588
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,880
encoding these trajectories or these

2589
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,199
series of equilibrium points of state

2590
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:42,800
transitions

2591
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,840
and that um basically you have

2592
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,600
you know prediction areas

2593
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,440
that are not handled elsewhere make

2594
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,719
their way there get temporarily stored

2595
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,560
and you can have um what's sometimes

2596
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,000
called semantic pointer architecture

2597
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,280
where basically

2598
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,360
as you're moving as you're stepping

2599
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,239
through these various equilibrium points

2600
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,719
you can then unpack this as estimates of

2601
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,199
system and world um in terms of

2602
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,960
operative policies and actions and what

2603
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,880
you expect at different points along

2604
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,639
these different trajectories and so here

2605
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,560
i'm focusing on moving through a

2606
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,360
physical space in this case making tea

2607
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,840
but this is i would argue this is also

2608
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,360
part of what we do when we navigate

2609
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:22,560
conceptual spaces that we are um

2610
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,800
deciding what branches do we go down to

2611
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,800
what degree where will we find what

2612
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,520
kinds of value and that this is a

2613
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,400
similar operation using similar

2614
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,000
procedures from common neural processes

2615
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,840
more recently i've been trying to extend

2616
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,360
this to

2617
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,719
models of

2618
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,159
volition including um free will

2619
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,159
and

2620
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,559
let's see

2621
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,760
i don't uh daniel how much time do i

2622
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,400
have left i'm sorry

2623
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,000
ten minutes okay great

2624
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,320
so

2625
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,239
this is uh less

2626
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,080
i guess explicitly

2627
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:11,679
slam framed um but still it's a

2628
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,280
hippocampus at the center of it and so

2629
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,480
so here

2630
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,440
um

2631
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,880
i'm trying to

2632
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,800
this is a recent piece that's in

2633
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,320
pre-print form which i would have uh i'd

2634
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,679
love feedback on

2635
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,040
but basically

2636
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,400
the idea is as you're

2637
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,360
that the present moment of experience

2638
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,679
uh has a thickness to it

2639
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,119
this is sometimes called the species

2640
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,520
present or the remembered present

2641
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,360
and that it seems to vary that the

2642
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,520
minimal thickness of a moment of sense

2643
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,800
making seems to be about a third of a

2644
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,560
second and the upper bound seems to be

2645
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,080
about three seconds

2646
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,840
and that this seems to correspond to um

2647
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,480
an epic so so you basically can so the

2648
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,639
hippocampus system can whenever you

2649
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,400
enter like a room

2650
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,719
it'll tile that domain with a certain

2651
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,880
degree of granularity it'll create these

2652
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,280
hexagonal tilings of that space

2653
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,520
and then within there that's where

2654
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,040
you'll have these different attracting

2655
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,560
attractors these different trajectories

2656
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,119
play out orchestrating the rest of the

2657
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,760
brain in terms of its dynamics to pursue

2658
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,760
these various goals

2659
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,239
and so the runway you have to work with

2660
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,080
in terms of the the thickness of the

2661
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,600
different rollouts for sophisticated

2662
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,639
inference

2663
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:22,400
would depend on

2664
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,119
partially uh the shelf life

2665
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,040
of this set of attractors before you

2666
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,360
have to refresh them uh in some way

2667
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,840
either set down an entirely new set or

2668
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,840
um uh try to recreate the old one or

2669
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,000
prevent the remapping and this would be

2670
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,520
related to some of what was what was

2671
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,040
just described with aerodynamics in

2672
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,040
terms of how good of a grip do i have so

2673
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,040
let's say you have like a poor grip on

2674
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,560
what's happening and your prediction

2675
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,159
error is going up this is not a good

2676
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:49,520
situation for you

2677
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,760
that might be a good opportunity to stop

2678
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,360
hold and catch fire

2679
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,159
re-tile space get a new set of operative

2680
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,960
policies for sophisticated inference

2681
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,840
and so

2682
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,639
um

2683
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,639
so here what i'm trying to do is show

2684
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,920
that

2685
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,040
um different levels of uh agonism of

2686
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,040
these serotonergic receptors involved

2687
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,320
with psychedelics um five hc2a receptors

2688
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,960
are influencing the stability

2689
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,920
of these sets of attractors

2690
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,639
and

2691
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:19,360
the

2692
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,040
vividness with which you were doing

2693
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,920
these imaginings and of rollouts of

2694
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,000
actions into the future

2695
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,920
and

2696
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,520
here it's

2697
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,119
it seems that what you could potentially

2698
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:33,040
do is describe some of a dose response

2699
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,560
curve for something like psychedelics

2700
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,800
where as the dose increases

2701
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,679
the extent of the rollouts

2702
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:42,400
become greater you've stabilized them

2703
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,960
and imagination become can become more

2704
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,719
vivid and can influence your policy

2705
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,239
selection more because you have more

2706
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,159
confidence in what you're seeing and so

2707
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:52,239
sophisticated inference your imaginings

2708
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,719
are contributing more to your ongoing

2709
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:56,880
overt action selection

2710
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,480
up to a point

2711
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,440
but then

2712
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,719
and so this would be

2713
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,199
and so this but then at a certain point

2714
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:05,360
um the idea is you keep dosing uh the

2715
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,679
animal or maybe the robot and it enters

2716
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,760
more of a creative dreamlike regime

2717
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,199
where it starts to lose coherence and

2718
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:14,560
you see the the extent of these

2719
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,880
rollouts of policy selection decreasing

2720
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,880
uh things are becoming more vivid but

2721
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,480
less coherent and sometimes you're

2722
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,320
getting uh and this itself could

2723
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,920
occasion error and potentially

2724
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,960
re-gripping

2725
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,400
in this model

2726
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,040
and so the idea that is that this would

2727
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,800
be a cognitive spectrum potentially in

2728
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,840
addition to explaining some of the

2729
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,199
neurophenomenology of things like

2730
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:34,719
psychedelics this could potentially

2731
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,320
explain some cognitive spectrums whether

2732
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,679
we're talking about

2733
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:39,040
maturation

2734
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,119
or aging or

2735
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,560
waking up you know when you first wake

2736
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,719
up to going to sleep

2737
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,880
these different parameterizations

2738
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,080
of

2739
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,920
your mechanisms for sophisticated

2740
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,520
inference helping to basically provide a

2741
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,679
neurophenomological handling of human

2742
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:58,000
uh of what it's like to be a person and

2743
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,840
all the variations of it

2744
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,880
and so

2745
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,920
i think

2746
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,239
that should be it for right now and uh

2747
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:05,520
happy to talk about all this with anyone

2748
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,400
who's interested thank you

2749
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,199
awesome thank you adam

2750
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,360
hi daniel

2751
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,719
hey

2752
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,880
and you're muted

2753
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,280
thank you very much any other uh notes

2754
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,920
you'd like to add

2755
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,159
um

2756
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,000
i think that's uh i think that's it for

2757
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,639
the moment great hope that you uh

2758
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,719
consider anything and join us for the

2759
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:43,840
round table shortly so thanks and we'll

2760
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,760
be right back with the final

2761
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,880
presentation by jf clutcher

2762
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,679
all right we are back

2763
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,480
this will be the final presentation of

2764
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,920
this interval

2765
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,320
this is jf klutcher

2766
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,040
towards a symbolic implementation of

2767
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,320
active inference for lego robots so

2768
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,719
looking forward to hearing this and then

2769
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,639
seeing you on the roundtable jf

2770
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,360
i'm jean-francois and i will talk about

2771
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,679
how i program lego robots as active

2772
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,679
inference agents

2773
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,360
this work contrasts with most robotic

2774
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,199
implementations of active inference

2775
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,800
which are based on probabilistic

2776
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,040
inference so i hope this will spark some

2777
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,760
interesting discussions

2778
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,040
well first of all i'm a software

2779
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,600
developer i'm not a neuroscientist

2780
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,719
um

2781
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,800
in my spare time well i like to code

2782
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,880
models of cognition because i'm keenly

2783
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,440
interested in all matters cognition and

2784
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,800
consciousness

2785
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,520
and i run them on robots because the

2786
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,840
real world is hard and i believe that

2787
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,920
writing code for robots is actually a

2788
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,480
very good way to test my understanding

2789
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,360
and

2790
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,000
coding itself helps make abstract

2791
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,360
concepts tangible to me

2792
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,360
so what do i want to accomplish

2793
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,719
well i want my robots to learn

2794
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,639
autonomously while they conform to the

2795
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:08,080
principles of active inference

2796
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,560
this is the current version of my robots

2797
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,400
there are two earlier versions and

2798
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,880
there's one in early development

2799
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,520
and here we'll see my uh robots the left

2800
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,800
car to the right nd uh driven by the

2801
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,880
interplay of generative models for

2802
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,520
hunger danger avoidance and wanderlust

2803
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,480
let's see them in action

2804
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,600
they navigate his face

2805
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,600
the sheet of paper on the floor

2806
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,440
represents food

2807
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,440
and they are attracted by the scent of

2808
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,000
food simulated by an infrared beacon on

2809
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,920
a pedestal

2810
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,679
so cars making a beeline to the food

2811
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:47,760
while andy is um

2812
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,840
having a problem getting traction and

2813
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,840
bumping into uh the walls

2814
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,080
carl is cautiously approaching but we'll

2815
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,600
get a little bit too close to the

2816
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,960
pedestal

2817
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,800
and this will engage its

2818
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,920
danger

2819
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,800
avoidance collision avoidance derivative

2820
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,360
of models

2821
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,719
he backs out

2822
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,560
andy is observing all this

2823
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,840
and he backs up as well

2824
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:28,719
carl is reapproaching food

2825
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,840
and this time we'll eat successfully

2826
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,800
and he has noticed that carl was

2827
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,280
freaking out

2828
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,679
and in sympathy freaks out himself

2829
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:46,960
while

2830
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,960
carl is eating

2831
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,119
all right so that was um

2832
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,199
the robots as they are right now after

2833
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:56,960
three iterations of this project

2834
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,400
so what it take what does it take to

2835
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,679
implement an active inference agent

2836
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,199
well there are three approaches one um

2837
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:07,199
let me take the numerical approach which

2838
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:09,679
basically puts the mathematics of active

2839
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,760
inference into code and

2840
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,840
runs uh that on robots

2841
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,280
um another approach is to take a

2842
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,960
symbolic approach

2843
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,760
where

2844
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,960
we have a

2845
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,119
code functions that operate mostly on

2846
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:27,040
symbols predicates etc here we can see

2847
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,520
we have the symbols for hungary very

2848
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,560
danger curiosity etc

2849
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,360
um but that's not the only option

2850
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,360
take e coli e coli is an active

2851
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,520
inference agent and its implementation

2852
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,080
is biochemical well i clearly didn't

2853
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,400
take that route i went this symbolic

2854
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,760
route

2855
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,360
well mostly because it's the familiar

2856
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,760
one to me and it provides me with a

2857
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,600
better scaffolding for my intuitions and

2858
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,239
exploration i also find that

2859
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:58,320
it handles complexity quite well

2860
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,679
when i started this project in 2017

2861
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:04,639
my first thoughts uh were to implement a

2862
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,800
society of mind i'd come across this

2863
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,560
concept uh

2864
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,880
decades ago it's a theory of mind put

2865
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,440
forward by marvin minsky

2866
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,119
50 years ago

2867
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,080
and

2868
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,000
at its core it says that intelligent

2869
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,480
behavior emerges from

2870
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,880
a lot of simple actors that interact in

2871
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,480
simple ways

2872
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,400
it so happens that i look at it as an

2873
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:30,080
architectural principle as well

2874
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,159
so how does one implement a society of

2875
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,520
mind um

2876
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,560
well

2877
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,560
to me the answer is clear is we use the

2878
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,840
actor model

2879
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,679
the actor model is a model of concurrent

2880
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,440
computation that was introduced by carl

2881
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,320
ewit in 1973.

2882
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,000
according to this

2883
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
model of computation

2884
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,040
we have

2885
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,280
independent actors which are

2886
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,199
processes concurrent processes each one

2887
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,760
managing its own state and the only way

2888
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,639
a

2889
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:01,119
an actor can interact or influence

2890
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:03,920
another actor is by sending it messages

2891
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,960
and once an actor receives a message it

2892
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,119
will interpret that message possibly

2893
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,119
modify its internal state and as a

2894
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:13,760
consequence of fire messages to other

2895
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,239
actors

2896
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:19,040
so building a society of mind using the

2897
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,440
actor model is quite a natural fit

2898
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:24,480
i also happen to program in the elixir

2899
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,080
language and elixir is a

2900
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,400
message-oriented multi-process language

2901
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,920
which is based on the actor model so

2902
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,280
it's a it's a perfect fit

2903
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,560
so here we are it's 2017.

2904
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:41,119
i own two um lego mindstorms ev3 kits

2905
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,920
they're wonderful robotic skids with a

2906
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,920
a nice choice of sensors mini motors and

2907
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,880
a

2908
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,119
computer the ev3 brick that controls

2909
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,320
them all

2910
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,880
and i want to build a society of mind in

2911
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,760
elixir on my eb3 robots

2912
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,480
i'm in luck there's a linux distribution

2913
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,000
called eb3dev

2914
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,040
that allows me to run elixir on

2915
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,880
the ev3 brick so i'm all set

2916
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,080
so

2917
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,000
that start that allowed me to start this

2918
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,159
project and this project as i said has

2919
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,080
completed three iterations and i'm

2920
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,480
starting a fourth one

2921
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,639
and we look at each one in turn

2922
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,360
reviewing the goals and also the issues

2923
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,920
uncovered

2924
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,920
first iteration 2017 version one a

2925
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:35,840
simple society of mind as i call it

2926
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,440
so

2927
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,880
i implement a an ad hoc model cognition

2928
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,639
it's not something that i i took from

2929
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,880
research is something i i

2930
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,199
made up myself it's homebrewed and let's

2931
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:48,960
have a quick tour

2932
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,960
so being a society of mine is bucketed

2933
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,920
with uh

2934
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,040
actors

2935
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,199
and um

2936
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:57,760
we have the detector actors and their

2937
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,600
responsibilities

2938
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,000
are to

2939
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,960
interface with the sensors and to pull

2940
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:05,760
them

2941
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,560
periodically to generate

2942
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,639
percepts which are events

2943
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:11,840
that are

2944
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,760
like all other events that the actors

2945
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,679
will produce are sent to the central

2946
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,119
nervous system actor which is a

2947
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,199
dispatcher which will then

2948
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,840
dispatch these events to other actors

2949
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,480
that are interested in them

2950
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:28,480
there's a memory actor and all events uh

2951
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,760
are sent to the memory as well to be

2952
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,719
stored for a certain amount of time and

2953
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:37,520
represent the past if you want to the

2954
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,360
agent and

2955
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,040
the other actors are able to query this

2956
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,480
memory in order to make whatever

2957
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,839
decisions they need to make

2958
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,560
one of the key actors are the preceptor

2959
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,760
actors

2960
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,239
and what they do is they

2961
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,840
ingest

2962
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,760
events perceptive ants

2963
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,599
originally from the detectors

2964
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,920
and analyze them maybe in the context of

2965
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,400
the past and produce higher level

2966
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,320
percepts for example a preceptor might

2967
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,719
be digesting a distance a percent from a

2968
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:07,840
detector

2969
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,199
look at it and say

2970
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:11,199
ah given

2971
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,320
prior

2972
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,440
distances

2973
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,760
i'm getting closer to an obstacle and in

2974
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,400
a higher level uh and then produce that

2975
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,679
percept and the high level perceptor

2976
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,119
might say ah i am

2977
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,679
getting closer to an obstacle and i am

2978
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:25,679
perfectly close to it so uh

2979
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:27,280
producer percent that says collision

2980
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,280
imminent and so forth and so on

2981
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,119
another important part of actor is the

2982
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,840
motivator and motivator is responsible

2983
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,239
for deciding what the robot needs what

2984
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:41,040
the robot wants and it expresses this

2985
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,599
need or this want as a motive

2986
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,599
event that is again centered in central

2987
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:48,000
nervous system dispatched in this case

2988
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,199
uh to the behavior actor and the

2989
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,920
behavior actor then takes this motive

2990
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,960
and acts on it by emitting

2991
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,280
intent events

2992
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,800
that are

2993
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,920
listened to by the actuator actors

2994
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,920
who translate these intents into actual

2995
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,480
commands and move the robot

2996
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,960
one key point is that the motivators

2997
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,360
actually are compete with one another so

2998
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,360
that the most important need of the

2999
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,280
robot is the one that's expressed so for

3000
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,560
example

3001
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,800
being getting getting to safety is more

3002
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:26,000
important than uh um satisfying hunger

3003
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,760
there's um

3004
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,239
let's look a little bit into one of the

3005
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,880
types of actors the behavior actors and

3006
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,480
uh the behavior actor is actually quite

3007
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,400
complex it does a lot of work it's not a

3008
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,880
simple actor it's implemented as a state

3009
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,159
machine and with every state transition

3010
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:44,719
triggered by a new percepts

3011
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,520
intents are emitted and so we can have a

3012
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,320
uh

3013
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:52,080
a behavior actor which job is to uh

3014
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,639
direct the uh robot to the food

3015
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,280
so um it works so let's see nd version

3016
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,800
one

3017
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,040
moving about and trying to get the boot

3018
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,880
which in this case is the blue paper on

3019
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,640
the ground

3020
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:10,719
[Music]

3021
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,719
so though it tries to avoid collisions

3022
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,440
uh it not always succeed here it finds

3023
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,000
out it's stuck

3024
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,199
backs out

3025
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,480
goes around

3026
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:33,360
doing a better job at avoiding obstacles

3027
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,560
and now makes a beeline to the food

3028
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,719
having detected it

3029
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:39,840
approaches

3030
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:42,000
cautiously and

3031
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
feeds

3032
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:50,239
all right

3033
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:52,080
so this worked quite well but there were

3034
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,800
issues with this version one uh not this

3035
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,159
is i don't think it was visible in the

3036
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,480
video but the robot was frequently

3037
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,560
overwhelmed by a constant flow of

3038
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,280
percepts out of the receptor the

3039
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,920
detectors constantly feed percepts into

3040
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:10,080
the society of mind and after a while

3041
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,480
they kind of back up and the robot

3042
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,000
starts reacting to

3043
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,719
uh

3044
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:16,239
old events

3045
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,639
and one solution was to actually put the

3046
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,480
robot to sleep once in a while paralyze

3047
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,159
it let the events wash through the

3048
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:24,800
system and then wake it up with uh with

3049
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,199
a clean slate so that was kind of a

3050
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,440
little bit awkward and another issue was

3051
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,880
that well there's no learning going on

3052
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,480
the robot doesn't get better with each

3053
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,880
run and given the model it wasn't clear

3054
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,960
to me where i could fit uh learning in

3055
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,119
there so

3056
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:42,480
time for uh version two

3057
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,080
so i need to find a way to make my

3058
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,280
robots learn

3059
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,679
and they also need to um

3060
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:49,599
better focus and

3061
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:51,280
be able of attention so they can avoid

3062
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,639
being overwhelmed with all these

3063
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,400
unneeded sensations

3064
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,800
i also need more computing power so i

3065
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,000
replace the eb3 brick by a raspberry pi

3066
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,239
3.

3067
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,560
about the same time i come across andy

3068
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,119
clark's book surfing uncertainty and i

3069
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:08,960
find that the predictive brain makes

3070
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,639
quite a lot of sense to me

3071
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:12,080
i think it tells a really good story

3072
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,599
about learning and attention so i

3073
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:15,840
decided to implement a predictive

3074
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,400
society of mind

3075
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,880
this is my first crack at it i won't go

3076
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,040
into uh the details i do in a companion

3077
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,920
paper

3078
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,679
um let's just say that they are actors

3079
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:27,920
for managing beliefs validating them

3080
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,080
making predictions and taking action

3081
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,080
when um to make these predictions come

3082
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:32,960
true

3083
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,639
there's also an attention actor for

3084
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:36,719
turning detectors on and off as needed

3085
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,040
and a focus actor for prioritizing

3086
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,960
belief validation

3087
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,880
i do introduce some learning the robot

3088
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,360
learns what actions tolerate correlate

3089
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:48,719
well with success but that's about it

3090
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:50,320
and

3091
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,239
there's the the model does not feel

3092
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:53,920
quite right to me at this point and they

3093
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,840
are bottleneck actors for example

3094
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,199
there's only one experienced actor

3095
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:59,199
there's only one attention actor only

3096
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:02,480
one memory of course and only one focus

3097
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,440
and

3098
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,440
in a society of mine that just doesn't

3099
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,199
feel right

3100
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:09,280
yep it still it works

3101
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:12,320
and let's watch andy um at on its first

3102
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,880
run it's nd version two hasn't learned

3103
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:17,040
anything yet

3104
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,840
so the same scenario

3105
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,679
so andy has detected the food would like

3106
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:25,280
to move towards it but doesn't know

3107
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,400
which actions validate believed

3108
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,840
best

3109
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,760
it smells food but still you know it's

3110
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,679
just heading into the wall

3111
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:35,280
so for indeed

3112
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,199
it's been quite uh

3113
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:39,119
unproductive here in its quest for food

3114
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,119
it's a little bit painful to watch let's

3115
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:42,159
stop

3116
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:46,639
um now here's andy uh 30 runs later and

3117
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,880
it's much more competent

3118
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:52,960
about matching beliefs and actions

3119
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,480
smells food and

3120
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,440
very confidently makes a bee line

3121
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:02,239
to that food

3122
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:05,360
just

3123
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:12,000
here we go

3124
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,400
slowly approaching

3125
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,520
obviously a very different anti from the

3126
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,639
the naive one

3127
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,679
and there we go

3128
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,599
okay so it worked

3129
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:31,280
uh but there's still uh there were

3130
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,679
issues with version two first the model

3131
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,760
doesn't quite feel right um to me it

3132
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,320
just doesn't quite capture um

3133
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,239
something didn't i didn't feel right

3134
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,719
about it and they were model bottleneck

3135
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:45,520
actors as well which is not a good sign

3136
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,599
and learning was limited to action

3137
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,199
selection

3138
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,599
so time for version three

3139
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:54,159
i call this one a society of generative

3140
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:55,760
models

3141
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,000
so i go back to the andy clark's book

3142
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,320
and uh and also read on the free energy

3143
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:01,599
principle

3144
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,159
um and it becomes clear to me that

3145
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,159
generative models are actually quite

3146
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:08,719
central in fact it's

3147
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:11,920
generate models all the way down so i

3148
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,520
get to work

3149
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:16,800
on a new model

3150
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,280
in this new model i have very few kinds

3151
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,440
of actors they're

3152
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:24,000
detector actors as before to interface

3153
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,760
with the sensors

3154
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,040
actuator actors to interface with motor

3155
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:32,080
speakers and whatnot

3156
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,880
and the only other kind of actor are the

3157
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,320
generative model actors the gm actors

3158
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:39,599
and there's quite a few of them in this

3159
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:42,800
case here uh 16 and

3160
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:45,040
they do the heavy lifting they do the

3161
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,119
belief updating the predicting the

3162
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:49,119
raising prediction errors the selecting

3163
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:51,040
selection of actions and

3164
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,040
they are responsible for remembering

3165
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:56,400
their past states and and actions

3166
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,679
um each gm operates within its science

3167
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:02,320
scope there there's one for uh locating

3168
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,520
food one for avoiding obstacles one for

3169
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,760
a detecting approach to obstacles and so

3170
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,000
forth and so on

3171
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,320
the gm actors have parent-child

3172
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,840
relationships

3173
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,599
um

3174
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:17,360
a

3175
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:20,320
apparent gm sends predictions as events

3176
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,800
about what it expects its children gm's

3177
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,360
to believe even what it itself

3178
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,599
believes and these prediction errors

3179
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,320
these predictions flow downward

3180
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,199
and

3181
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:34,080
prediction errors flow upward if a child

3182
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,239
gm receives a prediction about what it's

3183
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:38,000
supposed to believe or it's expected to

3184
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,440
believe and it's not what it believes

3185
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,920
and it sends back a prediction error up

3186
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,480
to its parents

3187
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,000
um

3188
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,480
well that means that a uh generic

3189
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,679
model's perceptions are

3190
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:54,320
in fact the uncontested predictions it

3191
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,239
makes plus the prediction errors it

3192
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:59,360
receives and the gm updates its beliefs

3193
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:02,320
based on these perceptions

3194
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,199
and given what it believes it may decide

3195
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:08,159
to take some actions and then raise

3196
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:11,199
intent events that reach the actuators a

3197
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:14,000
little bit like before

3198
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,960
the generative models are kind of

3199
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:19,280
grouped uh into different areas of

3200
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,520
concern there was uh there's being which

3201
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:22,960
is responsible for

3202
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,400
deciding whether we're in danger we're

3203
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:27,760
hungry or free there are the danger uh

3204
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,239
gms which have to do with uh

3205
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:33,199
clearing obstacles uh trying to stay in

3206
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:35,760
well-lit areas avoiding collisions with

3207
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,159
other the other robot and whatnot

3208
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:40,639
then there are hunger gms

3209
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:42,960
um that have to do with eating seeking

3210
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,719
food etc

3211
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:47,280
and there's the freedom gm which i call

3212
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,480
the wonderlust gm which basically

3213
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:52,480
says well i'm neither endangered nor

3214
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,679
hungry so let me just roam around

3215
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,360
and finally there are these two ones

3216
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,920
here which have to do with guessing the

3217
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,320
intent of the other robot and we'll go

3218
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:06,080
into more details with these two

3219
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:11,280
so let's look more closely at the gm

3220
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:14,880
actor remember that a gm as a as parent

3221
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,239
gms and

3222
02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:17,840
child gms

3223
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,719
that the predictions flow downward and

3224
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:23,199
prediction errors flow upwards

3225
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:24,639
let's look inside

3226
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,840
a gm defines one or more conjectures um

3227
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,239
a conjecture is a potential belief

3228
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:32,560
for example whether i know where food is

3229
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,159
or whether i'm about to collide i have

3230
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:37,040
two different conjectural beliefs

3231
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,119
a belief may either be a goal that's a

3232
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:41,040
belief we want to make true like i'm

3233
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,080
eating or an opinion which is a belief

3234
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,000
that i want to validate for example that

3235
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,040
i am

3236
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,960
approaching food

3237
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,280
a conjecture is typically activated when

3238
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:54,000
the gm receives a prediction about the

3239
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,599
conjectured belief

3240
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,239
and a conjecture knows how to check its

3241
02:00:58,239 --> 02:01:00,800
associated belief to see if it's valid

3242
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,719
it knows how to make predictions given

3243
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,719
that belief and how to decide what

3244
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:07,280
actions to take to either achieve or

3245
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,239
test the belief

3246
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,239
a gm learns how well alternate courses

3247
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,239
of actions policies correlate to

3248
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:18,480
achieving validating belief

3249
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,840
it also

3250
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,560
keeps track of which child gm it trusts

3251
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,880
more should they send competing

3252
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,480
prediction errors so it does precision

3253
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:27,679
weighing

3254
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,360
um

3255
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,920
and each gm actor

3256
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,920
works in its own time it's a concurrent

3257
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,199
process

3258
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,560
and it does

3259
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,360
one

3260
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,800
uh

3261
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,599
it does it it operates one round at a

3262
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:44,239
time and we'll see what a round means

3263
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:47,599
and it remembers um it's fast rounds

3264
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,840
uh it's past perceptions the predictions

3265
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,599
is received in the past its past beliefs

3266
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:54,239
and actions

3267
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:58,000
so now let's look at the uh life cycle

3268
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,239
of a gm actor

3269
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:03,280
well as i said agm actor operates round

3270
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:05,840
after round after round so what's around

3271
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,719
first the window round is started

3272
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:11,440
gm carries over the perceptions and uh

3273
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:12,719
beliefs from the previous round it

3274
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,599
doesn't start from from scratch

3275
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:16,960
and if it's in the midst of trying to

3276
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,159
achieve a gold belief it may

3277
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:23,520
at us as it starts you around activate

3278
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,679
conjectures for that

3279
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:26,960
action belief

3280
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:29,440
and um as a result

3281
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,840
send

3282
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,840
predictions to child gms

3283
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,679
once we're done starting the round is

3284
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:38,320
active and then the uh gm actor just

3285
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,560
sits there for maybe i don't know 300

3286
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:44,320
milliseconds waiting for events

3287
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,639
events like predictions coming from

3288
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:48,960
above from parents that will then

3289
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,440
activate uh conjectures trying to prove

3290
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:54,000
that the predicted belief is actually uh

3291
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,719
true this will cause predictions to be

3292
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:58,560
sent to child gms

3293
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,719
and as a consequence maybe

3294
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:03,360
prediction errors will come up and the

3295
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:06,719
gm will update its perceptions

3296
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:09,520
when the the round is completed either

3297
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,480
because we've heard from all the

3298
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,960
children or because time's up

3299
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,920
the gm completes this current round it

3300
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:18,480
updates uh position weighing keeps its

3301
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,440
trusted perceptions updates its beliefs

3302
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,280
uh as a result may send prediction

3303
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,880
errors because they could the new

3304
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,880
beliefs conflict with uh predictions

3305
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,599
that it had received uh before

3306
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:31,920
it updates its policies

3307
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,840
and um

3308
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:36,800
it decides on the course of action since

3309
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,520
uh intense and notifies the round it's

3310
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,080
completed and we continue so round after

3311
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,400
round after round

3312
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,000
i mentioned that uh

3313
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,079
there were two very uh kind of more

3314
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:50,880
interesting gms in the society of uh

3315
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,040
generative models

3316
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:55,440
these are these two gm's and they

3317
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:58,320
represent uh my little foray into theory

3318
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,040
of mind these gms

3319
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,119
are dedicated to guessing what the other

3320
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,719
robot is doing

3321
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:07,199
so each robot observes the other

3322
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:09,679
and detects patterns of movements and

3323
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:11,360
infra intentions

3324
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,280
from these patterns

3325
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,280
there's only two kinds of intents that

3326
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,280
are

3327
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,520
inferred one is that the

3328
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,679
other robot is has detected food and is

3329
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,159
making a move towards the food or that

3330
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:25,920
the other robot is

3331
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,280
in danger and hispanic

3332
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:31,520
now how does a robot see the other robot

3333
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:32,400
well

3334
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:35,199
in addition to the

3335
02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:37,040
array of sensors i already had from

3336
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,440
previous version i've added

3337
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:42,560
a new sensor a 360 beacon seeker and

3338
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:45,040
what this beacon seeker sees is the

3339
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:48,400
beacon um on the back of

3340
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,920
the other robot so each robot has a

3341
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:51,679
beacon on its back that broadcast and

3342
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:53,760
then 360 radia

3343
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,239
radius

3344
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,560
circumference angle

3345
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,320
it

3346
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,719
signifies here i am here i am here i am

3347
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:05,040
and the other robot can

3348
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,440
detect how far the other robot is and at

3349
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:10,880
which relative orientation

3350
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:11,760
so

3351
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,960
that let's say one robot here uh carl is

3352
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,000
making a bee line to the food

3353
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,639
andy has been observing this

3354
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:22,560
and seeing the pattern of movement which

3355
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,440
is a very uh straight uh

3356
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,320
uh

3357
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:27,599
trajectory

3358
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,639
uh infers that the carl has detected

3359
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:32,719
food and is homing in on it and may

3360
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:35,040
decide to follow carl and get to the

3361
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,119
food as well

3362
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:38,560
um

3363
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,400
another pattern of movements would be a

3364
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,159
chaotic

3365
02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:45,119
pattern of movement and i'd say

3366
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:47,360
carl had been backing away in panic from

3367
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,440
hitting the pedestal and andy was

3368
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,679
observing this and it noticed that this

3369
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:53,679
thing kind of a chaotic pattern and

3370
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,119
inferred that

3371
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:57,920
a car was in a panic and decided to get

3372
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:59,840
into panic as well if you remember the

3373
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,440
video at the beginning of the

3374
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,520
presentation

3375
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,040
so

3376
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:06,719
this is doing well

3377
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:08,480
but um

3378
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:10,880
we all know debugging is hard i find out

3379
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:13,599
also that debugging societies of mind on

3380
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,960
robots is very hard

3381
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,199
in order to help myself i develop a

3382
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:21,360
simulated simulation environment i think

3383
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,360
of it as simulated embodiment which

3384
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,360
allows me to

3385
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:28,480
observe what goes on inside a given

3386
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:29,520
robot

3387
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,440
it helps for debugging it helps for

3388
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,840
experimentation

3389
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,079
in the simulation word world

3390
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:37,280
a robot

3391
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,719
my robots

3392
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,560
virtual robots live in a grid world

3393
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:44,800
there are obstacles the blue tiles there

3394
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,840
are uh kind of darker areas that the

3395
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,119
robot tries to avoid which are

3396
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:52,719
represented in the black and gray uh

3397
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:53,760
squares

3398
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:56,560
and and then there's the food um which

3399
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:00,800
is the green uh tiles here

3400
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,199
as the robots uh

3401
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,840
navigate that space you know by using

3402
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,040
their uh society of generative models

3403
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,040
i can see where each robot is in terms

3404
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,040
of its state

3405
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:15,840
first i can see where it's located i can

3406
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,960
see its orientation when it's last said

3407
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,119
what the last action it executed and i

3408
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:23,440
can see the state of its virtual sensors

3409
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,960
and virtual actuators

3410
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,040
i can also peek inside

3411
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:33,040
the various generative models of a robot

3412
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,119
here i'm looking into the avoiding

3413
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:38,079
obstacle gm of nd and i can look at the

3414
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:40,159
state in the current round or in past

3415
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:42,159
rounds and i can see which predictions

3416
02:07:42,159 --> 02:07:44,960
came in which conjectures are activated

3417
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,440
what are the current perceptions

3418
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:50,000
uh what beliefs that the robot uh holds

3419
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,199
at the time and um what actions

3420
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:54,960
it thinks are uh

3421
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,880
are more likely to work and what actions

3422
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,239
it is taking

3423
02:07:58,239 --> 02:08:00,400
very very helpful but this moves really

3424
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,960
fast and so i i can actually slow down

3425
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:05,520
the simulation even pause it and then

3426
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:06,800
look inside the various generative

3427
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,400
models and see if what's happening is

3428
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,800
what i expected would happen so create

3429
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,480
debugging debugging tool and

3430
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,880
experimentation tool

3431
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,880
so i'm quite happy with version three i

3432
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,639
think it aligns quite well with the

3433
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:21,119
active inference ontology

3434
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:23,679
um there are no bottleneck actors

3435
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:26,000
and but learning is still limited to

3436
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
selecting um

3437
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,840
action policies

3438
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,840
however i think that the version 3 sets

3439
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:34,159
the stage very well for the new

3440
02:08:34,159 --> 02:08:36,480
iteration and this one has an ambitious

3441
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,400
learning agenda and it's just getting

3442
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,400
started

3443
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,440
so version 4 starting now

3444
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:46,960
i call it active inferencing

3445
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,320
so here's what i want to achieve as the

3446
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:53,199
robot interacts with its environment and

3447
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:56,079
i and learns how to maintain

3448
02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:58,079
it i wanted to learn how

3449
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:00,000
i want it for i want for it to learn how

3450
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,320
to maintain its homeostasis

3451
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:05,679
by uh growing uh its own society of

3452
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:07,199
generative models so instead of being

3453
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:08,320
given

3454
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:11,040
an apiary set of generative models i

3455
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:15,360
want the robot to learn that set

3456
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:19,679
not only that but i want each gm to

3457
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,320
learn its own capabilities i wanted to

3458
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,920
infer its logic programs that when

3459
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:29,440
executed will infer predictions from

3460
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,400
perceptions will infer beliefs

3461
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:35,520
from uh also from its perceptions

3462
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:39,199
and infer policies that will validate or

3463
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:42,799
invalidate its belief

3464
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,040
so how does one do that

3465
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:46,800
well there's a very very interesting

3466
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,840
paper that i

3467
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:52,320
found which is uh called making sense of

3468
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:55,199
sensory input written by richard evans

3469
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:57,520
and all from a deep mind

3470
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:58,639
and

3471
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:01,920
it answers the question of how do you uh

3472
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:02,800
learn

3473
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,400
um a

3474
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:07,280
causal theory

3475
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,320
that

3476
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:11,679
explains a sequence of sensations

3477
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,639
and once you've built that causal theory

3478
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:16,480
you can then apply it to predict what

3479
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,320
the next round of sensations or

3480
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,119
perceptions will be and thus make

3481
02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:24,560
predictions about them

3482
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:27,040
now just to to read from the beginning

3483
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:29,040
of the paper

3484
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,280
making sense involves constructing a

3485
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:34,159
symbolic causal theory that both

3486
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:37,119
explains the sensory sequence and also

3487
02:10:37,119 --> 02:10:40,400
satisfies a set of unity conditions

3488
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,320
now unity conditions are actually a set

3489
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,960
of constraints derived from cons

3490
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,239
philosophy

3491
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:47,119
um

3492
02:10:47,119 --> 02:10:49,040
that ensure that all the pieces of the

3493
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,840
theory form a coherent whole

3494
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,520
semantically speaking i won't go into

3495
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:56,639
the details but it's quite fascinating

3496
02:10:56,639 --> 02:10:58,079
the paper goes on

3497
02:10:58,079 --> 02:11:00,480
making sense of sensory input is a type

3498
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,400
of program synthesis but it is

3499
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:06,400
unsupervised program synthesis

3500
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:09,520
so the the paper

3501
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:12,159
presents an app reception engine

3502
02:11:12,159 --> 02:11:16,159
this is the software that will generate

3503
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:19,280
will infer causal theories from sensory

3504
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,679
data

3505
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:23,760
it is

3506
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,079
at its core it's a code generator what

3507
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:29,360
it does is it synthesizes logic programs

3508
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:32,079
that implement these causal theories

3509
02:11:32,079 --> 02:11:34,079
and when you run these logic programs

3510
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:37,679
you can predict incoming sensations so

3511
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:39,599
essentially a perception engine

3512
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,520
generates uh predictors

3513
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,320
and the way it does that is it searches

3514
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,599
for predictor logic programs in a space

3515
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:52,560
of potential possible logic programs

3516
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,880
it's a search problem and

3517
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:58,320
it's it's the the search space is

3518
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,639
extremely large of course so we need a

3519
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:03,520
way to constrain it

3520
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,119
we need to apply

3521
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:07,760
sorry strong inductive biases to

3522
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:10,560
restrict the search

3523
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,880
that's where the unity conditions come

3524
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,040
in

3525
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:18,320
so

3526
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,639
in order to

3527
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:23,920
derive its own predictor a gm will

3528
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:27,679
search for good predictors using app

3529
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:30,239
perception

3530
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:32,800
so given around a prior round of

3531
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:35,679
perceptions remember that the uh

3532
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:38,719
the gm has a memory of each round and in

3533
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:40,719
each round a set of simultaneous

3534
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:45,360
perceptions given that sequence

3535
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:48,560
a gm will search a space of candidate

3536
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:52,079
predictors for a good one

3537
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,400
what makes a predictor well two things

3538
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,239
first there's a scope and then there's

3539
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:00,320
rules the scope is

3540
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,480
essentially the objects the rules will

3541
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:04,480
be about and the belief predicates that

3542
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:07,440
will be used in the rules

3543
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,440
the rules well there's three kind of

3544
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,840
rules there's the static rules

3545
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:12,960
which

3546
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:15,360
apply on a set of simultaneous

3547
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:18,800
perceptions like at time n uh in it the

3548
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:21,679
rules validate and possibly also infer

3549
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:23,599
uh implied perceptions missing

3550
02:13:23,599 --> 02:13:24,719
perceptions

3551
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,840
an example of a static rule might be

3552
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:28,960
if

3553
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,199
the robot is at distance zero from an

3554
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:33,760
obstacle it is also touching the

3555
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:34,880
obstacle

3556
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:36,480
then there are causal rules and the

3557
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,480
causal rules

3558
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:39,760
essentially

3559
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,159
infer the perceptions at time n

3560
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:45,360
plus one given the perceptions at time n

3561
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:46,159
uh

3562
02:13:46,159 --> 02:13:49,199
they predict the next perceptions

3563
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:52,000
an example of a causal rule would be

3564
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,960
if the robot is at distance x from an

3565
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:57,599
obstacle and the robot is approaching

3566
02:13:57,599 --> 02:13:59,040
the obstacle

3567
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,199
in the next round of perception the

3568
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:02,880
distance of the robot to the obstacle

3569
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:05,199
should be smaller

3570
02:14:05,199 --> 02:14:06,960
and finally there are conceptual rules

3571
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:10,480
which are rules that kind of make the

3572
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:11,920
whole predictor hang together

3573
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,440
semantically there are

3574
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:16,239
rules of mutual exclusion for example

3575
02:14:16,239 --> 02:14:18,400
there can only be one distance between a

3576
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:21,119
robot and an obstacle

3577
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:24,480
and rules of uniqueness

3578
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,599
which

3579
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:27,199
i'm sorry the rule of uniqueness would

3580
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:29,280
be that they they can only be one

3581
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,440
distance yes rule of uniqueness they can

3582
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,360
only be one distance for example between

3583
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,360
two objects and mutual exclusion might

3584
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,760
be um a robot

3585
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:39,119
cannot both

3586
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:41,199
approach an obstacle and be touching it

3587
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:44,079
at the same time

3588
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,679
so the

3589
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:48,800
app reception engine of uh will kick in

3590
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:50,239
for agm

3591
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:53,040
when the current predictor of the gm is

3592
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:55,599
no longer good enough for the jobs like

3593
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:56,320
we've

3594
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:58,719
we've produced a predictor and now we

3595
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:00,079
have more rounds of perceptions and the

3596
02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:01,920
predictor is doing a really bad job at

3597
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:04,560
uh predicting the next perceptions and

3598
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,800
then the perception engine will kick in

3599
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:09,760
and try to produce a better predictor

3600
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,599
for that gm so that happens for all the

3601
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:14,079
gms

3602
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:18,639
and once we have a good predictor the gm

3603
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:21,440
even the current set of perceptions can

3604
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:24,480
infer the next set of perceptions thus

3605
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:27,440
make predictions

3606
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:31,280
so we talked about uh how a gm learns um

3607
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,920
but what about how it learns how about

3608
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:36,880
learning uh the entire society of gm's

3609
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,400
how does a robot

3610
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,719
form its society of gms through

3611
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:42,320
interactions with the world

3612
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,360
well

3613
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:46,239
this was going to be guided by a uh

3614
02:15:46,239 --> 02:15:48,639
a midtech cognition gm that's something

3615
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:51,920
that's given when the robot starts live

3616
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:55,119
it has a basic set of

3617
02:15:55,119 --> 02:15:58,159
detectors set of actuators that is a

3618
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:01,360
given and it also has a metacognition

3619
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:05,799
gm it's also a given

3620
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:07,119
the

3621
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:09,040
metacognition gm

3622
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,440
its role is to watch over and guide the

3623
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:15,519
evolution of a society of gms

3624
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:18,880
that's the action

3625
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,000
for it to function though each gm must

3626
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
act as a

3627
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,560
cogniti cognitive sensor

3628
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:27,920
it must

3629
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:30,079
produce sensations

3630
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:31,199
such that

3631
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:33,920
such as um are prediction errors

3632
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,439
trending up or down

3633
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,920
uh do policies

3634
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:40,879
uh particularly uh predictably impact uh

3635
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:42,160
my beliefs

3636
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,040
or

3637
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,760
very importantly within my purview is

3638
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,840
the robot's homeostasis at risks these

3639
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,760
are cognitive sensations that a gm will

3640
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:52,160
produce will be uh

3641
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:54,000
absorb uh listened to by the

3642
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,679
metacognition gm

3643
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:56,959
and

3644
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:58,879
that will allow it to update its own

3645
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:00,398
beliefs about

3646
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:03,120
how well the society of gms is doing uh

3647
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:05,920
does it have sufficient coverage is each

3648
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,920
gm capable enough and based on that um

3649
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,280
may take corrective actions by creating

3650
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:16,080
new gms

3651
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,040
and

3652
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:20,080
possibly if one gm is not doing very

3653
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,799
well that is stuck in a rut um

3654
02:17:22,799 --> 02:17:25,280
removing it and replacing it with

3655
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,519
another so that's the the role of the

3656
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:30,718
metacognition energy

3657
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:31,439
so

3658
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:33,280
how can the robot tell whether it's

3659
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:36,478
doing better or worse than before given

3660
02:17:36,478 --> 02:17:38,398
what it has learned well

3661
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:39,679
feelings

3662
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:41,439
that's how

3663
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:43,840
so a robot will have internal sensors

3664
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,840
for feelings and i'm thinking about

3665
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:47,439
feelings of hunger

3666
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:49,760
which increases uh with physical and

3667
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:51,519
mental exertion and

3668
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:54,160
is reduced with eating

3669
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,160
there's the feeling of pain which would

3670
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,240
go up with the number of collisions but

3671
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:59,840
would be reduced automatically with the

3672
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,558
passage of time simulating healing and

3673
02:18:02,558 --> 02:18:04,398
then i'm thinking also

3674
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:07,359
of the feeling of only

3675
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:08,398
which

3676
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:11,439
goes up is if a gm is not learning

3677
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:13,599
anything if it's logic programs are

3678
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:15,920
unchanged for a long period of time and

3679
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,080
but on me goes away when the

3680
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:21,039
the gm is learning

3681
02:18:22,558 --> 02:18:25,040
feelings uh i have a balance

3682
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:27,599
positive negative i'm hungry very hungry

3683
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,599
negative balance i'm not hungry at all

3684
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:31,040
positive balance

3685
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:33,760
and a negative balance signals uh risks

3686
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:37,000
to homeostasis

3687
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:40,879
and uh

3688
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:46,000
when uh beliefs are derived from um

3689
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,240
feelings with a negative balance or a

3690
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:50,799
positive balance then these beliefs take

3691
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:52,718
on this balance

3692
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:53,760
and

3693
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,599
this is going to be used to uh

3694
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:58,000
prioritize actions because actions that

3695
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,420
promote beliefs with a strong

3696
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:01,679
[Music]

3697
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:02,879
balance

3698
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:04,799
will be prioritized for

3699
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:07,840
actions that do not so uh in other words

3700
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:10,959
a a agm with very strong feelings will

3701
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:12,398
have its actions

3702
02:19:12,398 --> 02:19:15,120
prioritized over uh gm's that currently

3703
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,718
uh want to take action but from uh

3704
02:19:18,718 --> 02:19:20,398
you know less

3705
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:21,679
less uh

3706
02:19:21,679 --> 02:19:22,959
less feelings

3707
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:24,959
less powerful feelings and if these

3708
02:19:24,959 --> 02:19:26,558
actions um

3709
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:29,920
uh conflict then the actions of the

3710
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,160
the the gm with stronger feelings will

3711
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:35,840
uh predominate will take over

3712
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,920
well given all this what do i think

3713
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:40,718
makes a robot an active entrance robot

3714
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:42,318
well there's many things but i'd like to

3715
02:19:42,318 --> 02:19:43,679
think that it's

3716
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:45,840
in its simplest expression for me at

3717
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:46,718
well

3718
02:19:46,718 --> 02:19:49,920
at least um an active

3719
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,359
uh robot is one that learns what to do

3720
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:55,840
in order to feel good uh more often than

3721
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:58,080
not

3722
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:00,640
so i'm hoping that this uh

3723
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:03,359
work will raise some uh big questions

3724
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:05,520
and and give me some insights into them

3725
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:07,760
uh for example what is the appraised

3726
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,439
knowledge that an agent must possess to

3727
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:11,280
learn autonomously

3728
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,960
what makes unsupervised learning

3729
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:16,880
converge on competency diverge and maybe

3730
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,800
a little bit more far out what can

3731
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,880
growing a society of gms learn from

3732
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:23,439
developmental biology i

3733
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:25,200
suspect that there are principles at

3734
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,200
work here that

3735
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,479
both that they both share

3736
02:20:30,479 --> 02:20:32,399
so that's it thank you very much thank

3737
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:35,280
you to the active inference institute

3738
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:37,920
for their help and encouragement

3739
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:41,840
um the version three of uh my work is

3740
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:44,160
available on github it's open source i

3741
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,800
can be reached on discord and by email

3742
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,120
and the companion paper to this talk is

3743
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,720
available on senator

3744
02:20:54,319 --> 02:20:57,439
all right great talk jf we'll take a

3745
02:20:57,439 --> 02:20:58,399
quick break

3746
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:59,840
and we'll be right back with the round

3747
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,840
table

3748
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,960
all right we are back

3749
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:20,080
this is the beginning of the second

3750
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:23,439
round table that's our last session in

3751
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:25,600
the second interval of the second

3752
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:28,479
applied active inference symposium

3753
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:30,800
and some more may be joining

3754
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:33,760
but i am joined here by adam saffron

3755
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:36,479
bruno lara and jakobs mecca

3756
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:37,680
and

3757
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:40,319
maybe just to begin it would be awesome

3758
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:41,920
if anybody who

3759
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:44,319
wanted to do

3760
02:23:44,319 --> 02:23:47,560
thank you

3761
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,960
and welcome to jf

3762
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:53,680
carl will be joining shortly

3763
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:56,560
um so perhaps to begin

3764
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:58,800
if anybody would like to

3765
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,920
provide a reflection on a talk that was

3766
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:03,600
not their own

3767
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:06,160
what was something that you felt like

3768
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:08,000
was brought to the table

3769
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,120
what was a a key problem area that was

3770
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,200
addressed and how did you see active

3771
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:15,840
inference being implemented and

3772
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,960
adding meaning in that situation

3773
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:32,080
i can maybe uh quickly just

3774
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:34,080
comment on uh

3775
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:36,000
jf's presentation since

3776
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,240
was the most recent i think uh

3777
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:42,080
definitely this symbolic approach to

3778
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:44,160
active inference is one that is

3779
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:45,840
has perhaps not been

3780
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:46,880
um

3781
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:48,960
that pushed forward

3782
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:50,240
in and

3783
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:53,120
like obviously there are different um

3784
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,120
approaches all around the field but i

3785
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:58,640
feel like that this particular

3786
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:00,240
perspective on pursuing this kind of

3787
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:01,520
emergent

3788
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:03,840
generative models which only have the

3789
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:07,359
very basic um

3790
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:10,320
kind of setup but then the complexity

3791
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:11,840
[Music]

3792
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:14,880
emerges through the usage of elixir and

3793
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,000
prologue

3794
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,120
i think was really interesting

3795
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:21,359
and um

3796
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:23,600
yeah i mean we

3797
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:25,920
talked about js project

3798
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,439
in the

3799
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:29,600
organizational meeting units quite a lot

3800
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,560
but

3801
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:33,280
every time i think about it it's

3802
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:35,200
really cool to

3803
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:38,680
see this implementation

3804
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,080
no

3805
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:45,760
i mean in terms of the

3806
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:47,359
recent one just

3807
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:49,359
the app reception engine like the

3808
02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:51,280
content inspiration and i found that to

3809
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,040
be really exciting

3810
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:55,439
um especially because you know uh

3811
02:25:55,439 --> 02:25:57,280
i've been taking some inspiration from

3812
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:59,280
kant some of the work and like wondering

3813
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:00,800
whether basically

3814
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:03,680
like these categories like are they not

3815
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:05,600
just like preconditions for judgment but

3816
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:08,399
like any kind of sense making whatsoever

3817
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:10,080
like any sort of

3818
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,600
world with composition that could be

3819
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,760
navigated and parsed

3820
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,720
and so

3821
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:16,479
um to see that that kind of work was

3822
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:17,600
being done with that level of

3823
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:21,720
sophistication was just amazing

3824
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,720
it is a thread that came up multiple

3825
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:29,520
times with juxtaposing discrete time

3826
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,080
continuous time and all of these

3827
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:33,920
and then it's almost like another

3828
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:37,680
dialectic with the numerical and this

3829
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:40,240
the distributional approach

3830
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:41,120
to

3831
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,280
variational inference sampling message

3832
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:46,240
passing a whole taxonomy of approaches

3833
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:47,600
that we've seen

3834
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,479
for active inference models and also

3835
02:26:50,479 --> 02:26:52,800
models of perception cognition and

3836
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,680
control outside of active inference

3837
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:56,800
and so

3838
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:57,680
maybe

3839
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:00,160
jf if you wanted just to provide

3840
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:00,840
a

3841
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:04,880
a thought on where you see the symbolic

3842
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:08,240
perspective coming from

3843
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:10,560
and intertwining with active inference

3844
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:12,880
directions and robotics like we were

3845
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:16,438
talking about today

3846
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:18,800
well i i think it comes in

3847
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:22,000
from different uh uh perspective ones is

3848
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,840
explainability

3849
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:27,040
of of uh choices and behaviors

3850
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:30,240
if uh the um

3851
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:33,439
the the robot is driven by a

3852
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:35,439
symbolic reasoning

3853
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:37,680
then it becomes relatively

3854
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:39,040
straightforward

3855
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:40,000
for

3856
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,960
it to provide an explanation of its

3857
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:44,479
behavior in terms of the chain of

3858
02:27:44,479 --> 02:27:45,520
reasoning

3859
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,160
that led to it so that's that's of

3860
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:49,359
interest

3861
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:51,760
uh in and of itself

3862
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:54,479
the other aspect is uh when it comes to

3863
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:56,080
the app perception engine

3864
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,359
it has a

3865
02:27:57,359 --> 02:27:58,560
an ability

3866
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:01,840
to develop a causal uh theory a symbolic

3867
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:04,240
causal theory from relatively

3868
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,280
small

3869
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:06,479
data set

3870
02:28:06,479 --> 02:28:08,800
so unlike machine learning

3871
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:11,040
solutions which require

3872
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:13,439
intensive uh

3873
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:15,600
intensive learning process which

3874
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:16,880
leads to an

3875
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:17,920
obscure

3876
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:20,080
uh

3877
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:22,720
causal theory if you want uh with the

3878
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:24,399
appreciation engine you have a

3879
02:28:24,399 --> 02:28:26,640
relatively small amount of data that

3880
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:30,479
that as input and a a causal theory

3881
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:31,600
that's

3882
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:33,439
symbolically expressed

3883
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:36,720
as output which can serve as a basis for

3884
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,640
explanation and justification and

3885
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,479
rationale

3886
02:28:40,479 --> 02:28:41,920
that being said

3887
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:44,800
uh if the um

3888
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:46,720
as part of the uh

3889
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,720
process of perception

3890
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:53,600
uh gm uh uh abduces latent objects and

3891
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:56,080
and induces uh predicates

3892
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,520
uh the meaning of these predicates are

3893
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,840
uh only uh

3894
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:04,800
to be inferred in context because

3895
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:07,280
they're gonna be called like p1 and p2

3896
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:10,000
and object o1 object o2

3897
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,880
you may by examine emanation just maybe

3898
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,880
infer ah i think that

3899
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,640
we're looking at a predicate that has to

3900
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:20,720
do with uh navigation and and and

3901
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:24,800
avoidance but that will not be clear so

3902
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:27,200
i i think uh

3903
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:29,520
in that regard there there are gains but

3904
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:31,359
they're not they're not absolutely clear

3905
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:32,319
in terms of

3906
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:33,840
explainability

3907
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,840
but when it comes to active inference i

3908
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:36,640
think

3909
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,319
that

3910
02:29:38,319 --> 02:29:39,680
what matters

3911
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,120
to me

3912
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:43,520
is that the robots behave

3913
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:45,439
according to the principle of active

3914
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:47,359
inference and not necessarily by

3915
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:51,840
implementing the mathematics of it

3916
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,720
so i don't think it's a contradiction

3917
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,399
as far as i'm concerned these are four

3918
02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:57,760
diseases that

3919
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:00,000
are our mind just symbolic programming

3920
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,800
and that's why i'm doing it that way

3921
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:04,800
thank you it's almost like in the

3922
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,920
textbook

3923
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,600
of active inference where we have the

3924
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:10,080
high and the low road and here's like

3925
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:12,080
the symbolic airdrop

3926
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,560
actually arriving at a similar

3927
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:15,760
place

3928
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:17,280
although being

3929
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,680
quite disjoint in its origins from the

3930
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,760
particular partition

3931
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:24,560
flows on continuous numerical variables

3932
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,640
a lot of the ways that we've seen things

3933
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:28,800
develop in the past several years

3934
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,680
so

3935
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:30,840
welcome

3936
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:33,280
carl if you would like to

3937
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:35,920
say hello or provide any remarks on

3938
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:37,680
anything that you've seen at the

3939
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:40,800
symposium or any overview thoughts on

3940
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:45,160
active inference and robotics

3941
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,560
well i've greatly enjoyed all the

3942
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,080
presentations there's so many different

3943
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:52,160
perspectives so uh um

3944
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:54,399
i will i would imagine

3945
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:56,319
my comments will fall on from what

3946
02:30:56,319 --> 02:30:57,760
people want to talk about so i'm going

3947
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:00,399
to just pick up on that last theme so

3948
02:31:00,399 --> 02:31:01,680
you know that

3949
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:04,880
jean france was um symbolic dropping on

3950
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:06,160
from high

3951
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:08,800
i i thought it was a really intriguing

3952
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:11,600
perspective um and it's a perspective

3953
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:14,560
that i've been actually forced into in

3954
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:17,439
certain applications of the uh golo

3955
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:18,960
fashioned mathematics of active

3956
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:21,680
inference so i thought it'd be useful to

3957
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:23,920
share that um

3958
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:25,359
in the sense that

3959
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:26,319
when you

3960
02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:28,479
write down

3961
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:31,359
discrete state space models and use the

3962
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:34,160
maths of uh minimizing variational

3963
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:35,840
expected free energy

3964
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:37,840
to invert those models

3965
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,319
very often you're confronted

3966
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:42,000
with specifying those models with

3967
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,960
boolean logic you know if this then that

3968
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:49,120
um and um you know

3969
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,280
literally in the code which you write to

3970
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:54,399
specify a particular tensor that maps

3971
02:31:54,399 --> 02:31:57,200
from some causes to some consequences

3972
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,359
you are literally using if and then

3973
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:01,359
statements and and or statements in

3974
02:32:01,359 --> 02:32:04,720
order to generate the tensors or or

3975
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:06,960
or the um

3976
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:08,960
the matrices that sort of encode

3977
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:11,280
probabilistic mappings which now become

3978
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:12,479
um

3979
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:14,240
deterministic mappings simply because

3980
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:15,840
you're populating these tensors with

3981
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:19,120
zeros and zeros and ones so i do see an

3982
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:20,399
enormous

3983
02:32:20,399 --> 02:32:23,760
opportunity here to actually um bring

3984
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:24,800
together

3985
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:27,040
the um you know

3986
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:28,640
the mathematics and the simple

3987
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,720
probability theory just using you know

3988
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,399
um categorical distributions or

3989
02:32:32,399 --> 02:32:34,720
dirichlet distributions of a particular

3990
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:36,399
sort you know where

3991
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:38,000
you're only dealing with some zeros and

3992
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:42,000
one probabilities and the kind of logic

3993
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:42,800
uh

3994
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,560
and perception that you were talking

3995
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:45,600
about i thought that was absolutely

3996
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,479
fascinating and one one thing that

3997
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:50,240
intrigues me

3998
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:51,040
is

3999
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:53,120
if you can do that

4000
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:54,080
um

4001
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,960
then that there is um

4002
02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:01,600
a way of doing your searches of all

4003
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:02,399
the

4004
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:05,359
potential programs or logical um

4005
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:07,359
statements that are internally

4006
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:08,560
consistent

4007
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:11,280
um with the evidence at hand you know

4008
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:12,800
for example i could build a generative

4009
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:14,479
model where i can be in two places at

4010
02:33:14,479 --> 02:33:16,640
the same time or two things can be in

4011
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:18,960
the same place at any one time that's

4012
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:20,240
you know from the point of the genitive

4013
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:22,240
model i can write that down

4014
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:24,560
without an exclusion principle

4015
02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:27,840
um but when i now come to see who asks

4016
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:30,800
the question is that model relative to

4017
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:32,319
another model that can be written down

4018
02:33:32,319 --> 02:33:34,800
in terms of boolean logic

4019
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:36,800
that precludes two things being in the

4020
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:38,960
same place any one time

4021
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:42,160
does that simpler model now provide a

4022
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,640
more a better explanation for the

4023
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,399
evidence at hand

4024
02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:48,240
so technically what that means is that i

4025
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:50,080
can apply the rules of bayesian model

4026
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,359
selection

4027
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:53,040
to this model versus that model where

4028
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:55,120
the model just is a statement of

4029
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,800
propositions uh

4030
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:59,600
logical propositions um and there are

4031
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:02,160
ways of um there are ways of sort of

4032
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:04,399
automating that very efficiently called

4033
02:34:04,399 --> 02:34:06,080
bayesian model reduction

4034
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:06,960
um

4035
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:09,520
and i'm just wondering whether you could

4036
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:12,240
take a lot of pressure off the search

4037
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:13,200
for

4038
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:15,280
the internally consistent

4039
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,359
logical structures that you're dealing

4040
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:21,760
with and if you can cast it in terms of

4041
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:24,000
um

4042
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:26,319
in terms of bayesian model reduction

4043
02:34:26,319 --> 02:34:28,840
which quite simply is measuring the

4044
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:31,760
evidence the probability of this

4045
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:34,160
sequence of outcomes that can itself be

4046
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:36,080
categorical you know i'm in this state

4047
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:38,399
all that state

4048
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:39,840
the probability of that particular

4049
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:42,640
sequence of discrete outcomes given this

4050
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:44,720
structure this generative model that is

4051
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:47,600
articulated as a logic and if you can do

4052
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:49,280
that i think that'd be very very

4053
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:51,520
powerful because that speaks to a common

4054
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,800
theme which i think

4055
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:55,200
most of us or you were talking about

4056
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:56,560
which is this issue of structure

4057
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,040
learning um you know and what you're

4058
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,600
talking about is is sort of a principled

4059
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:03,520
way to get the right parsimonious

4060
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:06,080
structures that have this

4061
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:08,640
you know this coherence i can't remember

4062
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:10,080
you

4063
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:12,000
you were even taking it right back to

4064
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,319
sort of 19th century philosophy or 18th

4065
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:16,399
century philosophy in terms of in the

4066
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:18,240
constraints would be really great

4067
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:19,200
to see

4068
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,960
whether that kind of um

4069
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:25,200
sort of logical structure uh the

4070
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:27,280
philosophers like um

4071
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:29,120
actually could be discovered or

4072
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:31,520
disclosed just using uh good

4073
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:33,920
old-fashioned basic model selection that

4074
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:35,439
there seems to be a close symmology

4075
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:36,880
there with some of the work of people

4076
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:39,840
like josh tenenbaum where he's he's he

4077
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:41,760
certainly articulates structurally

4078
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:42,640
learning from the point of view of

4079
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:45,040
radical constructivism using sort of

4080
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:47,760
programmed searches and sort of um

4081
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,200
um

4082
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:51,520
you know casting generative models as

4083
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:54,160
programs and then it's trying to score

4084
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:56,960
the quality of these programs uh using a

4085
02:35:56,960 --> 02:35:58,640
form of basic model selection and he

4086
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,720
claims to be able to do sort of millions

4087
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:03,840
um very very effectively with it within

4088
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:06,240
um you know within a few seconds

4089
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:07,840
have you have you looked at josh

4090
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:11,040
chellenbaum's work at all

4091
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,040
not yet but i certainly will

4092
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:15,600
and i just want to uh make clear that

4093
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,920
that the appreciation engine uh was

4094
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,319
developed by richard evans uh in the

4095
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:23,040
paper making sense of sensory input

4096
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:26,640
um and and yes one of the the the core

4097
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:30,720
issues is inductive bias uh how do you

4098
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:32,640
restrict the search space so that you

4099
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:35,280
can have a chance of finding within a

4100
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:37,359
reasonable amount of time a logic

4101
02:36:37,359 --> 02:36:39,359
program that is a competent

4102
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:40,800
predictor

4103
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:44,399
and those and that's where cons

4104
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,800
synthetic unity of our perception

4105
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,560
uh plays in

4106
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:52,240
as it provides constraints on the the

4107
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:55,680
class of uh logic programs which are uh

4108
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,120
acceptable

4109
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:58,399
uh

4110
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:00,479
which are are yeah which are uh

4111
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:02,160
considered valid

4112
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:03,439
and

4113
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:05,359
if if i make a contribution because this

4114
02:37:05,359 --> 02:37:07,120
is work in progress

4115
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:08,960
i would like to add additional

4116
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:11,680
constraints of from the fact that we do

4117
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:13,920
not uh we're not trying to generate

4118
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:16,880
one generative model in in

4119
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:18,960
in and of itself but as in the context

4120
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:21,120
of a society of generative models so

4121
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:23,200
general will

4122
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:24,160
borrow

4123
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,920
its perception domain from the belief

4124
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:28,399
domain of other generative models thus

4125
02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:31,200
creating additional constraints and as

4126
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:35,439
it searches it will try not to modify

4127
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:37,920
its scope in such a way that it orphans

4128
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:39,840
other generative models so

4129
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,280
as the

4130
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:43,680
society of general models grows so does

4131
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:46,160
the same set of constraints that apply

4132
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:47,840
on reducing

4133
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:50,319
the search for a

4134
02:37:50,319 --> 02:37:52,479
predictor in any of the generative

4135
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:56,880
models themselves so i'm hoping that as

4136
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:59,600
the society of general models grows so

4137
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:02,080
does the set of constraints that apply

4138
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:05,760
on the searches for any one of them but

4139
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:07,520
i think the name of the game is very

4140
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:08,960
much in

4141
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:09,840
this

4142
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:11,520
the richness and the strength of the

4143
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:13,920
inductive biases that are applied on

4144
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:16,240
search

4145
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,800
just to

4146
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:20,560
highlight a few pieces of what were

4147
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,880
addressed and then to bruno or adam or

4148
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:25,680
anyone who'd like to add

4149
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,640
it impressed on me robotics is radical

4150
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:30,240
constructivism

4151
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:32,479
not just in the sense of the

4152
02:38:32,479 --> 02:38:34,399
constructing models but also in the way

4153
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:36,720
that adam described in terms of the

4154
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:40,000
relationship to the embodied artifact so

4155
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,319
that is one interesting piece and

4156
02:38:42,319 --> 02:38:43,520
another

4157
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:44,880
in this

4158
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:47,520
quest to find the rainbow that connects

4159
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,600
first principles and analytic

4160
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,280
formulations

4161
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:53,920
through mesoscale for example

4162
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:56,319
computational code all the way to the

4163
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:59,840
last mile in the cases that we heard

4164
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,920
from one hot chen in the previous

4165
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:03,760
session

4166
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:06,160
carl when you described the way that

4167
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:08,840
boolean logic

4168
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:13,439
enters at the level of execution

4169
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:15,600
was very interesting

4170
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:18,080
and suggests that there is kind of like

4171
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:22,240
a uh a brackish area similar to that

4172
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,720
between discrete and continuous time

4173
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:28,080
models in like hierarchical modeling but

4174
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:29,359
here

4175
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:30,319
where

4176
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,640
the numerical and the

4177
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:35,280
statistical approaches to active

4178
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:36,720
inference

4179
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:37,600
are

4180
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:40,640
becoming connected to

4181
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,040
actual logical implementations and

4182
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,359
design choices that have to do with

4183
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:48,000
which functions are executed first or

4184
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
the conditions that certain things occur

4185
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:50,960
in

4186
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:53,520
and so there actually is a meeting

4187
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:56,000
ground or an interface in a way

4188
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,800
implicitly already and so it is very

4189
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:01,280
interesting to see how

4190
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:04,240
jf's work on the generative model

4191
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:06,080
generation

4192
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:07,439
process

4193
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:10,720
is now approaching that intersection

4194
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:13,040
from the other side and suggesting it's

4195
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:14,399
like if you see a car coming from the

4196
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:15,920
other direction

4197
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:17,520
there's a road

4198
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:20,640
and now this high and low road network

4199
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:23,680
starts to grow more pathways

4200
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:24,800
so

4201
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:27,600
bruno or adam would be happy to hear any

4202
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:30,240
thoughts you have

4203
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:33,200
um yeah thanks um

4204
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:35,600
yeah i mean i think that's that's um

4205
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:38,560
that's much our case as i was telling

4206
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:40,960
you like we come from this other side of

4207
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:42,319
of the story

4208
02:40:42,319 --> 02:40:44,880
and at the end we have to make some

4209
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:47,040
choices on implementations

4210
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,600
and so far we've been very focused on on

4211
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:52,640
these um self-organizing maps most of

4212
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,399
our work is on that

4213
02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:56,720
uh and that's actually one one of the

4214
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:58,960
questions i have for for all of you like

4215
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:01,040
what's your take on on all these

4216
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:03,279
approaches that we're trying to like

4217
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:05,760
we're coming from a different field from

4218
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,120
a different

4219
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:10,399
point of view and in a way we are almost

4220
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:12,880
uh intentionally avoiding

4221
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:15,359
uh probabilistic approaches to active

4222
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:16,880
inference no

4223
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:17,920
so

4224
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:19,680
i don't know what's what's your opinion

4225
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,200
on that that was the first one and the

4226
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:24,080
second one is more like a um i don't

4227
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:26,319
know like a a doubt

4228
02:41:26,319 --> 02:41:29,439
a question for carl like

4229
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:34,000
what do you see in the near future on on

4230
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,760
all these things so that we're working

4231
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:38,000
on on prediction aerodynamics and this

4232
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:41,120
monitoring of the of the error over time

4233
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:42,560
um

4234
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:47,199
can yeah i think that's that's

4235
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:50,080
i'd i'd love to speak to that if i can

4236
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:50,880
yeah

4237
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:52,800
in fact interestingly it does actually

4238
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,479
also speak to your question daniel i

4239
02:41:54,479 --> 02:41:56,880
just wanted to point out also that this

4240
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:59,359
notion of moving between continuous

4241
02:41:59,359 --> 02:42:01,279
states-based models and discretized

4242
02:42:01,279 --> 02:42:03,200
state-space models is something that

4243
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:05,200
people in quantum computing and physics

4244
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:06,399
are going to keep their close eye on

4245
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:08,800
because if you get all digital um then

4246
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:11,200
the opportunity for quantum computing

4247
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:13,439
raised it raised its head so it was also

4248
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:14,800
very pragmatic

4249
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:17,920
um uh pragmatic reason to sort of

4250
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:20,880
look at that um that transition and also

4251
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:23,040
just to bring in uh adam's point you

4252
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:26,319
know not only um was he suggesting that

4253
02:42:26,319 --> 02:42:28,960
we quantize discretize

4254
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:31,520
spatialize in terms of little tiles and

4255
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:34,399
places uh receptive fields for being

4256
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:36,240
here as opposed to being over there but

4257
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,560
he's also suggesting we do that in time

4258
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:40,720
so i think the quantitization

4259
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:44,080
of space time in a generative model

4260
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:45,680
is a really important thing of course

4261
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:48,319
you know you could argue that that's a

4262
02:42:48,319 --> 02:42:50,560
step closer to good old-fashioned

4263
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:52,080
symbolic ai

4264
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:54,080
that has a meaning in in the sort of

4265
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:55,680
focus psychology sense

4266
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:59,120
so to come to bruno's question so the

4267
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:02,080
big divide here is between um from my

4268
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:03,439
point of view at least degenerative

4269
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:06,479
models that are of continuous states and

4270
02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:09,439
time versus genetic models that are of

4271
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:11,120
discrete states and

4272
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:13,600
states and time and clearly you need

4273
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:16,319
both yeah in the sense the the world

4274
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:18,960
that a roboticist and indeed me and my

4275
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:22,000
children live in is a continuous world i

4276
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,200
have to move around it i have to um

4277
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:27,040
control continuous temperatures and all

4278
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,040
sorts of things and

4279
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:30,960
and yet it seems as if the the

4280
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,120
intelligence is at a symbolic level so i

4281
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:34,160
think what we're talking about is a

4282
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:36,640
hybrid genetic model and then the

4283
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:38,000
question is how do you get the sort of

4284
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
discrete parts to talk to the continuous

4285
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,600
parts but if we just focus on the

4286
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:44,479
continuous parts um and just to answer

4287
02:43:44,479 --> 02:43:47,040
bruno's question directly um

4288
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:48,479
first of all what i'm saying is you

4289
02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:50,640
can't ignore the continuous bits so

4290
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:52,080
everything you would talk about in terms

4291
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,399
of self-organizing maps has to be there

4292
02:43:54,399 --> 02:43:56,720
at some level um it's just a question of

4293
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:59,359
whether you can put a more symbolic um

4294
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:01,600
logical structure on top of it to cause

4295
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:04,880
screening sufficiently to resolve all

4296
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:08,479
the complexity um the i i i loved you

4297
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,080
your work um

4298
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:14,000
i could see uh all the important um

4299
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,840
issues in terms of um

4300
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:20,319
representing uncertainty as

4301
02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:22,080
the if you like

4302
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:24,960
the stand-in for the valence of how i am

4303
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:26,720
doing so i was amused to hear that

4304
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:28,479
you're trying you're actively avoiding

4305
02:44:28,479 --> 02:44:31,279
probability theory yet for me everything

4306
02:44:31,279 --> 02:44:33,680
you said was all about probability it's

4307
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:35,760
all about uncertainty and that was at

4308
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:37,600
true at so many levels so just to answer

4309
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:39,840
danielle's question to you uh the

4310
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:41,439
relationship between free and

4311
02:44:41,439 --> 02:44:43,439
variational free energy and the

4312
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:45,279
prediction error is really trivial and

4313
02:44:45,279 --> 02:44:47,840
very simple it's just under continuous

4314
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:50,160
state space models with gaussian random

4315
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:51,680
fluctuations

4316
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:54,479
the uh free energy gradients are just

4317
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:56,160
are the prediction errors the signed

4318
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:58,720
prediction errors so it's really your

4319
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:01,040
simple quadratic forms for the log

4320
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:05,040
probabilities um so um self-organizing

4321
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:07,279
maps that organize themselves in terms

4322
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:09,279
of responding to prediction errors just

4323
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:11,359
are systems that are performing a great

4324
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:13,920
inflow on a variation free energy under

4325
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:15,040
the assumption you're dealing with

4326
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:17,920
continuous states that have gaussian by

4327
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:20,640
random by central limit theorem uh

4328
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:23,600
gaussian random fluctuations so i i you

4329
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:26,479
know that that's all exactly what you

4330
02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:27,200
know

4331
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,200
what would please me if i was if i was a

4332
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:30,640
probabilistic

4333
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:32,160
committed to the probabilistic

4334
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,359
punishment

4335
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:35,200
you your i think your thing you're

4336
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,040
bringing to the table though is is this

4337
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:40,399
sort of the dynamics of the uncertainty

4338
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:42,000
or the amplitude the prediction error

4339
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,520
the unsigned prediction error the sort

4340
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:45,200
of the behavior of prediction errors

4341
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:46,880
over you know with the separation of

4342
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:49,439
time scales and i think that that that's

4343
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:52,319
a really important um really important

4344
02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:54,000
move um

4345
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,040
i i see slight homologs of that not

4346
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:59,120
formally identical but certainly um

4347
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:01,439
homologs of that um

4348
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:03,600
um from the point of view of an engineer

4349
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,200
this would be like getting the kalman

4350
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:07,279
gain right you know if you interpret a

4351
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:10,479
calm and gain on a kalman filter as

4352
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:12,240
assigning the right precision or

4353
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:14,479
confidence to the

4354
02:46:14,479 --> 02:46:15,840
prediction errors as they come in

4355
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,760
relative to to the state estimators and

4356
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:19,200
your your prior beliefs that you've

4357
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:21,439
accumulated getting that right having an

4358
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:23,520
adaptive kalman filter where you're

4359
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:26,000
actually optimizing the calm and gain uh

4360
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:26,800
you know

4361
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:28,720
that would be if you like the state of

4362
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:31,120
the art hierarchical camera bc filtering

4363
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:34,240
so that if i was a psychiatrist i would

4364
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,240
say this is exactly what goes wrong in

4365
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:38,560
people with uh schizophrenia and autism

4366
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:41,120
is that they've got their estimators of

4367
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:42,800
the overall

4368
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:43,680
um

4369
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:47,040
uncertainty or prediction error wrong um

4370
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:50,479
and that they now need to um you know

4371
02:46:50,479 --> 02:46:53,840
and this is an explanation for um

4372
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,840
false belief updating of false state

4373
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:57,520
estimation from the common filtering

4374
02:46:57,520 --> 02:46:58,640
point of view

4375
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:01,279
the the other point um that struck me in

4376
02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:04,880
in in the early part of your talk was um

4377
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:07,359
something which um

4378
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:09,920
as a neurobiologist or motor control

4379
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:11,520
theorist um

4380
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:13,120
something that they would find very

4381
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:15,040
entertaining which was the

4382
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:16,399
link between

4383
02:47:16,399 --> 02:47:19,040
the ability to ignore stuff and sensory

4384
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,359
attenuation i don't know if you've come

4385
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:23,279
across that in robotics but

4386
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:24,319
um

4387
02:47:24,319 --> 02:47:26,560
certainly in terms of motor control of

4388
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:28,479
the kind i think you're using which is

4389
02:47:28,479 --> 02:47:31,040
which i would um ascribe to the

4390
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:32,800
equilibrium point hypothesis like

4391
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:34,000
approach approaching so you you're

4392
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,319
putting your set point into into the

4393
02:47:36,319 --> 02:47:38,479
actuator and you're letting the reflexes

4394
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:40,319
do the rest but

4395
02:47:40,319 --> 02:47:42,960
you've got to control carefully um how

4396
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:44,399
those prediction errors are used to

4397
02:47:44,399 --> 02:47:46,000
drive the actuator make sure they don't

4398
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,600
come back up and change your state

4399
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:49,840
estimation and so from the point of view

4400
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,399
of sensory attenuation that just is

4401
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:55,040
attenuating the precision or the inverse

4402
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:57,520
variance or estimation of the overall

4403
02:47:57,520 --> 02:47:58,640
amplitude

4404
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:00,960
so and finally you know

4405
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:03,680
looking at the long term trends

4406
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:07,040
in the estimated precision i think is

4407
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:10,240
you know it is a really important way

4408
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:12,240
to see whether you've got the right

4409
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:15,200
generative model for this context um and

4410
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:16,640
i noticed you were you're citing the

4411
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:18,479
work of um

4412
02:48:18,479 --> 02:48:20,880
manchester united uh you know and that

4413
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:23,200
was i think he's really great

4414
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:25,120
insight many years ago interesting from

4415
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:27,439
economics he was working with economists

4416
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:28,479
uh

4417
02:48:28,479 --> 02:48:31,680
at that time so so uh i think that's

4418
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:33,840
very very important as well it's all

4419
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:37,520
about estimating uncertainty

4420
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:41,840
yeah thanks a lot um

4421
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:44,479
i mean as you can see there is uh well

4422
02:48:44,479 --> 02:48:47,439
obviously we come from this this side of

4423
02:48:47,439 --> 02:48:48,240
uh

4424
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:50,479
woolpert and you you can you can see all

4425
02:48:50,479 --> 02:48:51,279
that

4426
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:51,920
all

4427
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:54,960
that literature behind our work and uh

4428
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:59,839
but yeah we're getting there and um

4429
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:02,720
that's that's uh

4430
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:04,240
that that's where we are going that's

4431
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:06,800
what we're intending and you'll see some

4432
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,560
some work that we're going to come out

4433
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:10,160
uh very soon

4434
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:13,040
that tries to to bring deeper this this

4435
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:15,120
this um

4436
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:18,240
to make more useful uh making better use

4437
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:20,479
of this of this um

4438
02:49:20,479 --> 02:49:22,560
monitoring and the other thing i was

4439
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:24,399
telling you i was thinking is something

4440
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:27,040
you mentioned is this waiting of the

4441
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:29,200
attenuation and and

4442
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:31,279
that's always been in our in our mind

4443
02:49:31,279 --> 02:49:33,760
again because of uh why can you tickle

4444
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:36,000
yourself and all these famous famous

4445
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
works um

4446
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,560
we have lots of doubts we have uh lots

4447
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:42,479
of discussion with with with people

4448
02:49:42,479 --> 02:49:44,800
about this attenuation and and the

4449
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:47,279
precision waiting and that's what we are

4450
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:49,439
now trying to to implement

4451
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:50,319
uh

4452
02:49:50,319 --> 02:49:53,840
again using self-organized maps but uh

4453
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,120
yeah we we we try to get results quite

4454
02:49:57,120 --> 02:49:58,000
soon

4455
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
and thanks a lot

4456
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,760
yeah just just to say

4457
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:03,040
i think that's really important because

4458
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:05,200
as soon as you can get dynamic

4459
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:06,319
dynamic

4460
02:50:06,319 --> 02:50:08,960
attenuation or gating

4461
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:12,319
um in play very much in the spirit of

4462
02:50:12,319 --> 02:50:15,359
what was implicit in um

4463
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:17,680
matt's um sort of homeostatic

4464
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:20,000
architecture you can talk i think

4465
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,680
genuinely you can talk about your your

4466
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:23,680
robots attending to this or ignoring

4467
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:25,840
that in the right kind of way and you're

4468
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:27,520
starting i think to get quite close to

4469
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:28,479
now

4470
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,319
sentience because you've got attention

4471
02:50:30,319 --> 02:50:31,920
in the mix

4472
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:34,479
you've got some a kind of metacognition

4473
02:50:34,479 --> 02:50:36,479
in your self-organizing maps which i

4474
02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:38,240
think license is something which is much

4475
02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:41,279
much closer now to sort of a sentient

4476
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:42,640
intelligence

4477
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:45,439
as opposed to just a reflexive kind of

4478
02:50:45,439 --> 02:50:46,399
control

4479
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:48,720
yeah that that's that's that's the idea

4480
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:52,319
let's let's hope for the best

4481
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:53,920
so

4482
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:54,960
a few

4483
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:57,920
points and then adam or jacob or anyone

4484
02:50:57,920 --> 02:51:01,040
um active inference is inference about

4485
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:02,000
action

4486
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,479
and it also uses action as one of the

4487
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:06,800
ways to reduce uncertainty and so it's a

4488
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:09,840
very tantalizing parallel with quantum

4489
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:12,319
active inference as being about quantum

4490
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:13,359
systems

4491
02:51:13,359 --> 02:51:16,080
and potentially using quantum

4492
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:19,200
in some way to run these models

4493
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:22,319
another point was in the recent folk

4494
02:51:22,319 --> 02:51:25,279
psychology paper with with ryan smith at

4495
02:51:25,279 --> 02:51:26,240
all

4496
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:28,479
there was a distinction of how

4497
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:30,560
increasingly cognitive and symbolic

4498
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:32,479
functions were being played by decision

4499
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:34,560
making active inference in the discrete

4500
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:37,359
setting while more motor behaviors could

4501
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:39,439
be played out by motor active inference

4502
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:41,520
in the continuous time setting

4503
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:44,160
and through this conversation i'm seeing

4504
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:44,960
how

4505
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:48,080
whether that is explicit or implicit

4506
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:50,240
that decision ai

4507
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:51,840
to motor ai

4508
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,040
handoff

4509
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:56,240
is mediated by a symbolic layer

4510
02:51:56,240 --> 02:51:58,160
either implicitly through the code

4511
02:51:58,160 --> 02:51:59,520
construction

4512
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:01,920
or potentially even explicitly with the

4513
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:04,319
kinds of approaches that we're exploring

4514
02:52:04,319 --> 02:52:06,640
and then one last area of some parallels

4515
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:07,840
that i'll

4516
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:10,960
like to hear from adam or anyone else

4517
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:15,120
self-organizing maps brought up by bruno

4518
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:17,359
have a lot of similarities with some of

4519
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:19,359
the graph operations

4520
02:52:19,359 --> 02:52:21,840
that tim ferbell and ozankittal and

4521
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:24,479
adam's work was describing and then the

4522
02:52:24,479 --> 02:52:26,640
harmonic modes

4523
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:28,720
that adam has described in work as well

4524
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:31,600
reminded me of the ultra stability that

4525
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:34,000
matt brown described in some of these

4526
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,720
more classical models of like

4527
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:41,840
synergetics and multi-scale harmonic

4528
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:42,880
and so

4529
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:44,640
adam or anyone else would be happy to

4530
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:47,680
hear any of those thoughts

4531
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:56,960
um okay just uh quickly to to answer

4532
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:58,399
adam um

4533
02:52:58,399 --> 02:53:00,240
i don't know exactly

4534
02:53:00,240 --> 02:53:01,200
how

4535
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:03,200
i mean what do you mean with

4536
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:04,880
oh by the way they can't see my question

4537
02:53:04,880 --> 02:53:07,040
on the audience maybe we should read ah

4538
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:09,520
sorry uh adam is asking to what extent

4539
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:11,680
can self-organizing maps be used as

4540
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:14,560
model of experience dependent plasticity

4541
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:17,359
as implementing a kind of implicit

4542
02:53:17,359 --> 02:53:19,680
neural architecture search i mean i

4543
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:20,960
don't know exactly what you mean with

4544
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:23,520
neural architecture search but um

4545
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:27,200
um there is this this um

4546
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:28,479
literature on

4547
02:53:28,479 --> 02:53:31,680
growing self-organizing maps so like the

4548
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:33,200
usual uh

4549
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:36,960
original architecture is is fixed

4550
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:38,880
but there is there is some

4551
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:41,120
implementations where you actually can

4552
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:42,880
add notes

4553
02:53:42,880 --> 02:53:46,080
and and they become more more well they

4554
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:48,560
have more plasticity and there is also

4555
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:49,359
the

4556
02:53:49,359 --> 02:53:51,920
the ones that don't stop learning so

4557
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:55,040
it's it's continuously moving so that

4558
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:57,840
helps you to not have a fixed structure

4559
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:00,319
and a fixed mapping of the sensory input

4560
02:54:00,319 --> 02:54:02,960
but it's it just moves as there is new

4561
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:06,080
data coming new input

4562
02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:07,680
coming in

4563
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:10,399
so that's that's two dynamical sounds

4564
02:54:10,399 --> 02:54:13,120
and growing sums i think if if you are

4565
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:15,359
interested in that

4566
02:54:15,359 --> 02:54:17,359
okay extremely uh

4567
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:19,920
i guess the the intuition or question

4568
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:21,680
was that

4569
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:23,840
um it's like you know i'm sure there are

4570
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:26,160
plenty of inductive biases that we

4571
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:27,680
come equipped with to

4572
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:30,319
help us converge on efficient regimes of

4573
02:54:30,319 --> 02:54:31,760
inference and learning

4574
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:33,840
but i'm also wondering the extent to

4575
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:34,640
which

4576
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:36,720
um i don't want to go too far with this

4577
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:38,240
kind of analogy but something kind of

4578
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:40,080
like a field programmable gatorade but

4579
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:40,880
like

4580
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,920
um

4581
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:45,040
that self-organizing map like dynamics

4582
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:46,800
could allow for

4583
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:48,080
um

4584
02:54:48,080 --> 02:54:50,399
the creation of different regimes of

4585
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:52,240
active inference like like to what

4586
02:54:52,240 --> 02:54:53,359
extent

4587
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:55,840
as you're like let's say um building up

4588
02:54:55,840 --> 02:54:57,200
a hierarchy

4589
02:54:57,200 --> 02:54:59,200
um

4590
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:01,120
at different levels of it based on where

4591
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:03,120
you are in this overall hierarchy or

4592
02:55:03,120 --> 02:55:06,319
hierarchy you might take on um very

4593
02:55:06,319 --> 02:55:09,040
different computational properties

4594
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:11,600
um via experience kind of plasticity so

4595
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:12,479
it's like

4596
02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:14,319
you you learn the inductive biases you

4597
02:55:14,319 --> 02:55:16,720
need as go um

4598
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:17,840
but

4599
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:19,279
to come back around with self-organizing

4600
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:21,040
maps um

4601
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:24,479
the locality and the the um

4602
02:55:24,479 --> 02:55:26,479
the topography of them

4603
02:55:26,479 --> 02:55:27,920
one thing i'm really curious about is

4604
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:29,439
the extent which they could actually be

4605
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:32,960
used for um modeling like um

4606
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:34,319
enter rhino and hippocampal

4607
02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:36,240
representations to what degree the

4608
02:55:36,240 --> 02:55:38,000
different operations that are

4609
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,640
um used for constructing these maps

4610
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:42,000
would also

4611
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,080
converge with them the kinds of

4612
02:55:44,080 --> 02:55:45,920
structural inference and structure

4613
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:47,279
learning that have been

4614
02:55:47,279 --> 02:55:49,359
described for the hippocampal system so

4615
02:55:49,359 --> 02:55:50,880
um

4616
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:52,160
i don't know the answers to that but it

4617
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:53,279
seems like a potentially fruitful

4618
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:55,439
intersection that daniel suggested

4619
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:58,479
so yeah definitely yeah i mean

4620
02:55:58,479 --> 02:56:00,560
i think in principle they they are

4621
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:02,080
inspired from the

4622
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:03,439
hippocampal

4623
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:06,000
activity you know the the maps

4624
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:06,800
and

4625
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:08,720
yeah there's lots of proposals out there

4626
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:12,080
of different ways of moving them but uh

4627
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:13,200
yeah i think

4628
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:14,880
they they would be very useful for what

4629
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:16,160
you want

4630
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:17,040
so

4631
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:18,880
that's why i'm talking about that like a

4632
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:20,240
general

4633
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:22,160
question for me that i'm i'm i've been

4634
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:23,680
wondering about

4635
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:24,640
is

4636
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:26,720
so i guess i'm suggesting that like

4637
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:29,920
you're getting these um represent these

4638
02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:30,720
um

4639
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:32,080
representations structure

4640
02:56:32,080 --> 02:56:34,160
representations potentially being

4641
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:37,600
um afforded by these uh place fields of

4642
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:38,960
the chemical system

4643
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:41,439
um but

4644
02:56:41,439 --> 02:56:43,680
one thing i'm wondering is so and that

4645
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:45,439
these would provide like equilibrium

4646
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:47,040
points like carl often we'll talk about

4647
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:49,359
the importance of structuring action and

4648
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:50,560
perception

4649
02:56:50,560 --> 02:56:52,880
um by these discrete acts that seem to

4650
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:54,080
be unfolding at roughly theta

4651
02:56:54,080 --> 02:56:56,560
frequencies and this seems to be like

4652
02:56:56,560 --> 02:56:59,120
the time scale of coherent action

4653
02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:01,520
selection for an organism of about our

4654
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:03,279
size that can do about the things we can

4655
02:57:03,279 --> 02:57:05,600
do with a brain about this big all kind

4656
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:08,960
of brought in the same temporal register

4657
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:10,880
um but

4658
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,359
and so this idea that like we might be

4659
02:57:13,359 --> 02:57:15,920
stepping along these representations in

4660
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:18,000
some ways like moving from like between

4661
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,680
these bump attractors

4662
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,479
um

4663
02:57:20,479 --> 02:57:23,200
as somehow structuring cognition by some

4664
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:24,960
sort of representation

4665
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:27,520
and i'm excited by that but i still

4666
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:30,080
don't have like a sense like uh for how

4667
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:32,880
far you go with that or ought to go like

4668
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:34,160
for instance so let's say we're talking

4669
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:37,200
about something like uh um

4670
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:40,560
uh this is actually something uh uh

4671
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:43,278
carlos that

4672
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:47,680
scolded me about in the past which is

4673
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:50,479
like before you like uh think of the

4674
02:57:50,479 --> 02:57:52,800
architectural principle think of the

4675
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:54,479
inactive uh

4676
02:57:54,479 --> 02:57:56,560
situatedness of the system and so

4677
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:58,240
something like i wonder is like so you

4678
02:57:58,240 --> 02:57:59,600
know i'm focusing like maybe you're

4679
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:02,960
getting this sort of inductive bias of

4680
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:04,640
like the hippocampus rhino system says

4681
02:58:04,640 --> 02:58:06,160
high level controller

4682
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:07,840
but to what extent

4683
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:09,920
are we implicitly doing

4684
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:12,800
things like symbolic reasoning but via

4685
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:15,200
like modes of enactment like to what

4686
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:16,640
degree like could you do something like

4687
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:17,920
like let's say we're kind of like

4688
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:19,760
purling causation and you want to do

4689
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:21,359
something like a do operator you could

4690
02:58:21,359 --> 02:58:22,880
have some sort of like graph some sort

4691
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:26,560
of like flow of inference like um

4692
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:28,800
maybe even like within like the like

4693
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:30,479
chain bump attractors like the

4694
02:58:30,479 --> 02:58:32,479
hippocampal system and uh

4695
02:58:32,479 --> 02:58:33,359
actually another thing that carl

4696
02:58:33,359 --> 02:58:34,880
actually brought up recently was um bump

4697
02:58:34,880 --> 02:58:36,720
attractors and the colliculus so maybe

4698
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:38,560
even like in terms like patterns of like

4699
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:41,040
ocular motor motion is potentially like

4700
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:43,200
providing like another means of

4701
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:44,800
accessing such representations and being

4702
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:47,680
governed by them uh

4703
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:49,840
but

4704
02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:53,600
to to what extent it is um

4705
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:55,920
is it too neurocentric is it actually

4706
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:58,000
like being realized more implicitly by

4707
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,319
the overall contextualized functioning

4708
02:59:00,319 --> 02:59:01,600
and like

4709
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:04,960
it's you know having

4710
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:08,319
open questions for me so

4711
02:59:08,319 --> 02:59:10,640
sure to carl and then jakub or anyone

4712
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:12,840
else who wants to

4713
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:16,479
talk to me

4714
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:21,600
can i tell adam off again or not

4715
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:24,160
i don't think he needs turning off um

4716
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:26,240
yeah it's interesting isn't it um i

4717
02:59:26,240 --> 02:59:28,880
wonder whether that is the um the

4718
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:30,960
interface that daniel was referring to

4719
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:33,760
um how do you get from a necessary

4720
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:35,920
continuous um

4721
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:38,399
bayesian filter coupling with the world

4722
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:41,920
i mean even with um carla and andy you

4723
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:44,399
know these things are moving continuous

4724
02:59:44,399 --> 02:59:46,800
states better so at some point even if

4725
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,720
it's actually um

4726
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,479
physicalized you know there is a

4727
02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:53,600
continuous uh generative model or um

4728
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:56,399
self-organization in play

4729
02:59:56,399 --> 03:00:00,080
and i'm reading um adam's question as

4730
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:02,319
you know is this too neurocentric to to

4731
03:00:02,319 --> 03:00:04,800
worry about bump attractors and the role

4732
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:07,680
of lateral inhibition for example in

4733
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:09,680
carving up receptive fields that could

4734
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:11,520
be actually written down as just sort of

4735
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:14,399
basically a quantized representation you

4736
03:00:14,399 --> 03:00:16,960
know for example um

4737
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:19,920
receptive fields in v5 or motion

4738
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:22,960
sensitive areas can either be expressed

4739
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:25,839
as a sort of continuous

4740
03:00:26,319 --> 03:00:29,120
preference for motion as a continuous uh

4741
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:31,120
you know function of

4742
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:32,800
visual velocity

4743
03:00:32,800 --> 03:00:35,359
or you can say no this population is

4744
03:00:35,359 --> 03:00:38,479
just encoding the probability that this

4745
03:00:38,479 --> 03:00:39,920
particular edge is moving at eight

4746
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:41,359
degrees per second

4747
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:42,240
um

4748
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:44,560
so you know

4749
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:45,359
if

4750
03:00:45,359 --> 03:00:49,200
if adam you were asking you know um

4751
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:51,439
are we being too neurocentric in over

4752
03:00:51,439 --> 03:00:53,680
interpreting the neuronal dynamics that

4753
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:56,479
just basically do the carving up into a

4754
03:00:56,479 --> 03:00:57,920
series of

4755
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:00,560
either tilings and receptive fields or

4756
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:03,200
place fields or in

4757
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:05,439
the context of some stable fixed points

4758
03:01:05,439 --> 03:01:07,840
you know sort of um

4759
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:09,120
thinking about

4760
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:12,319
histoclinic channels as you know one way

4761
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:14,560
of articulating a discrete set of

4762
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:16,800
ordinarily organized uh fixed points

4763
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:18,399
that have you know that's the way that

4764
03:01:18,399 --> 03:01:20,399
we should understand it i i don't know

4765
03:01:20,399 --> 03:01:22,560
but i think you know it could certainly

4766
03:01:22,560 --> 03:01:24,880
if you can read them in both ways

4767
03:01:24,880 --> 03:01:26,720
i think that then gives you license if

4768
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:28,479
you want to simulate and reproduce and

4769
03:01:28,479 --> 03:01:31,120
silicone these kinds of computations it

4770
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:33,200
certainly allows you to replace

4771
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:35,840
heteroclinic channels um heterogeneous

4772
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:39,279
cycles uh bump attractors receptive

4773
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:41,760
fields of this kind with a discrete

4774
03:01:41,760 --> 03:01:43,840
representation

4775
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:45,520
and you know

4776
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:47,840
to me

4777
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:49,840
practically that would be an important

4778
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:51,520
and important way to proceed that's

4779
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:52,960
simply because that minimizes the

4780
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:54,880
complexity of the genetic model and it

4781
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:56,960
minimizes the complexity you maximize

4782
03:01:56,960 --> 03:02:01,200
the uh the model evidence um so you know

4783
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,960
i don't know whether being neurocentric

4784
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:04,880
is um

4785
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:06,800
as a good thing or a bad thing it you

4786
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:08,240
know interesting just think about so

4787
03:02:08,240 --> 03:02:10,319
what is what what is a self-organizing

4788
03:02:10,319 --> 03:02:12,800
map um so when i was at school it was

4789
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:15,279
just basically um

4790
03:02:15,279 --> 03:02:17,200
a uh

4791
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:19,520
a couple map lattice with with lateral

4792
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:22,800
inhibition to to um to do this sort of

4793
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:24,640
uh carving up and segregate those

4794
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:27,359
various populations um or localities

4795
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:30,560
from other localities so if that's the

4796
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:32,479
case again you've got this notion of

4797
03:02:32,479 --> 03:02:34,800
natural inhibition when i take all light

4798
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:37,520
dynamics what is that well is that a

4799
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:39,359
statement of this exclusion principle

4800
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:42,479
and i mean beyond simply your

4801
03:02:42,479 --> 03:02:44,640
the the sort of exclusion principles i

4802
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:46,479
can't be in one place at any one time

4803
03:02:46,479 --> 03:02:48,800
but the fundamental exclusion that you

4804
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:50,560
get when dealing with discrete state

4805
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:53,120
spaces you know i've got to be in this

4806
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:56,160
state and i'm not in any other state

4807
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:58,399
and that means that being in this state

4808
03:02:58,399 --> 03:03:00,640
means i have to inhibit being in any

4809
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:01,760
other state

4810
03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:04,240
just to get a sum to one constraint so

4811
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:08,160
just by going um if you like discrete

4812
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,479
you're naturally inducing

4813
03:03:10,479 --> 03:03:12,720
by physical architecture that requires

4814
03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:15,840
the kind of lateral inhibition that is

4815
03:03:15,840 --> 03:03:17,200
one of the defining features of a

4816
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:20,000
self-organizing map so that might be a

4817
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,800
virtue uh or you know

4818
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:25,040
of of being a bit neurocentric in the

4819
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,120
sense of you know

4820
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:29,520
understanding evolution as working its

4821
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:31,760
way to a coarse brain minimally complex

4822
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:34,000
discretized symbolic representation of

4823
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,319
the world and we just now read receptive

4824
03:03:36,319 --> 03:03:38,880
fields in a slightly

4825
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:41,359
oh we over interpret them they're just

4826
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:43,040
you know basically

4827
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:45,120
encodings i the world is likely to be in

4828
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:47,279
this state from my point of view

4829
03:03:47,279 --> 03:03:50,240
can i just make one final point um

4830
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:52,640
which kept on recurring to me that there

4831
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:55,040
were people chasing you on this i'm

4832
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:56,880
thinking about bruno and self-organizing

4833
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:59,359
maps and adam in the uh and actually

4834
03:03:59,359 --> 03:04:02,399
matt as well with his um

4835
03:04:02,399 --> 03:04:04,800
i think there's a slow realization

4836
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:06,800
that these kinds of architectures are

4837
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,560
the way to go

4838
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:10,800
that's coming out of machine learning

4839
03:04:10,800 --> 03:04:12,240
when people are getting bored with that

4840
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:14,720
propagation so they're now all turning

4841
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:16,880
to local energy

4842
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:19,200
based rules and they now realize that

4843
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:21,200
they get much better performance from a

4844
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:22,560
deep neural network

4845
03:04:22,560 --> 03:04:24,720
if they just use a local energy based

4846
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,560
rule and what would that look like it

4847
03:04:26,560 --> 03:04:27,680
would look exactly like the

4848
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:29,760
self-organizer

4849
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:31,680
self-organizing maps all three of you

4850
03:04:31,680 --> 03:04:34,479
been talking about it's just me my note

4851
03:04:34,479 --> 03:04:35,920
trying to predict everybody else around

4852
03:04:35,920 --> 03:04:39,920
me um uh you know

4853
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:42,479
and doing so by minimizing my local

4854
03:04:42,479 --> 03:04:44,800
variation free energy or minimizing the

4855
03:04:44,800 --> 03:04:47,120
prediction errors uh you know

4856
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:48,479
mathematically

4857
03:04:48,479 --> 03:04:50,399
those being equivalent

4858
03:04:50,399 --> 03:04:52,720
you know the twist here is that the

4859
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:54,720
you know this can be applied to

4860
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:56,319
effectively uh you know overly

4861
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:58,319
expressive amorphous a completely

4862
03:04:58,319 --> 03:05:00,399
connected neural network and it will

4863
03:05:00,399 --> 03:05:02,000
still work with the right kind of

4864
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,760
pruning you will start to get to the

4865
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:05,200
sort of nice hierarchical structures

4866
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:08,000
that bruno was showing uh or the you

4867
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,200
know with the right kind of temporal

4868
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:10,960
scheduling you'll get to the nice that

4869
03:05:10,960 --> 03:05:12,960
you're the nice uh tolmaneken bound

4870
03:05:12,960 --> 03:05:15,200
machines but at the end of the day these

4871
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:18,319
are just um they're just sort of deep

4872
03:05:18,319 --> 03:05:20,640
networks or even deep that is networks

4873
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:24,720
with a local um a local energy and those

4874
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:26,319
things i've now noticed certainly in the

4875
03:05:26,319 --> 03:05:28,240
university of oxford are now called

4876
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:29,840
predictive coding

4877
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:31,920
so there's no necessary no prediction

4878
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:33,439
there's no there's no prediction in the

4879
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:35,279
temporal sense that adam was trying to

4880
03:05:35,279 --> 03:05:36,399
emphasize

4881
03:05:36,399 --> 03:05:40,560
or in the sense of a kalman filter it's

4882
03:05:40,560 --> 03:05:42,880
just that they rely upon the local

4883
03:05:42,880 --> 03:05:44,479
computation of prediction errors to

4884
03:05:44,479 --> 03:05:46,720
generate the local energy function

4885
03:05:46,720 --> 03:05:48,720
so i see you know the people the

4886
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:51,200
reactionaries in deep learning you know

4887
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:54,319
the young turks who want to do it better

4888
03:05:54,319 --> 03:05:56,560
they've all now identified predictive

4889
03:05:56,560 --> 03:05:58,479
coding as the rhetoric

4890
03:05:58,479 --> 03:06:01,200
in order to say this is how it's done

4891
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:04,160
and it's just a statement of or your you

4892
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:06,800
don't need to do um i think bruno had a

4893
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:08,880
nice phrase do you or perhaps it was

4894
03:06:08,880 --> 03:06:11,279
perhaps it was um france fossil diffuse

4895
03:06:11,279 --> 03:06:12,560
your learning everywhere through back

4896
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:14,640
propagation you if it's working properly

4897
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:16,080
you should just be able to do it locally

4898
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,600
with your own little

4899
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:19,359
node

4900
03:06:19,359 --> 03:06:22,160
vertex of your som or gm in a

4901
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:25,279
in an in your fonts

4902
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:28,720
if i could uh build on that and then

4903
03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:31,359
anyone else who'd like to add

4904
03:06:31,359 --> 03:06:33,760
a challenge that exists and it's

4905
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:36,319
recognized in robotics and many of the

4906
03:06:36,319 --> 03:06:38,479
presentations brought up was how to move

4907
03:06:38,479 --> 03:06:40,880
from continuous and high dimensional

4908
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:44,160
data like a high resolution video camera

4909
03:06:44,160 --> 03:06:47,040
or multi-sensor integration

4910
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:48,880
in the world

4911
03:06:48,880 --> 03:06:50,160
eventually

4912
03:06:50,160 --> 03:06:51,520
towards

4913
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:53,840
logical and conditional contextual

4914
03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:54,800
action

4915
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:56,640
and so when we see the neural network

4916
03:06:56,640 --> 03:06:58,800
representations we kind of see sometimes

4917
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:00,560
zooming in and zooming out and different

4918
03:07:00,560 --> 03:07:01,840
ways that people are training those

4919
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:04,000
models including limitations and those

4920
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:05,279
models training like the back

4921
03:07:05,279 --> 03:07:07,600
propagation that carl just mentioned as

4922
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:09,680
well as that stephen grossberg has gone

4923
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,880
into

4924
03:07:10,880 --> 03:07:12,319
and so

4925
03:07:12,319 --> 03:07:15,600
trying to contextualize that issue in

4926
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:17,600
light of what we're discussing about

4927
03:07:17,600 --> 03:07:20,720
discrete time and about symbolic logic

4928
03:07:20,720 --> 03:07:22,240
it seems that

4929
03:07:22,240 --> 03:07:24,640
through the partially observable

4930
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:26,880
framework not even saying the partially

4931
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:29,040
observable markovian framework but here

4932
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:31,680
including holographic principle and so

4933
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:32,960
on

4934
03:07:32,960 --> 03:07:35,520
there's a way to move from a continuous

4935
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:38,240
statistical distribution and make a map

4936
03:07:38,240 --> 03:07:40,800
to a discrete statistical distribution

4937
03:07:40,800 --> 03:07:44,000
like the a matrix in the pomdps that we

4938
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,399
use can have a continuous variable and

4939
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:48,160
then map that onto a discrete

4940
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:50,240
statistical distribution

4941
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:51,279
and then

4942
03:07:51,279 --> 03:07:53,600
i wondered if there's something like a

4943
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:54,960
logical a

4944
03:07:54,960 --> 03:07:57,040
another tale of two densities a tale of

4945
03:07:57,040 --> 03:07:59,760
two different cities or a third city and

4946
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:01,439
so this matrix

4947
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:03,520
recognizes logic

4948
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:04,840
from discrete

4949
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:06,880
distributions that's the recognition

4950
03:08:06,880 --> 03:08:09,279
density and then the generative density

4951
03:08:09,279 --> 03:08:11,279
is the emission of logics that are

4952
03:08:11,279 --> 03:08:15,200
compatible with discrete distributions

4953
03:08:15,200 --> 03:08:16,640
because

4954
03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:18,960
with the recognition direction

4955
03:08:18,960 --> 03:08:21,760
recognizing conditional logics and

4956
03:08:21,760 --> 03:08:25,200
searching over relatively small sets of

4957
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:26,640
possible conditional logics from

4958
03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:29,680
discrete distributions is possible like

4959
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:32,560
a verb is never used two verbs in a row

4960
03:08:32,560 --> 03:08:35,200
are not used or something like that

4961
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:36,880
from a discrete distribution logic can

4962
03:08:36,880 --> 03:08:38,800
be extracted or recognized

4963
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:40,000
and then

4964
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
if there's a discrete distribution or

4965
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:43,120
more

4966
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:45,520
logics can be sampled and that speaks to

4967
03:08:45,520 --> 03:08:47,359
that inductive bias

4968
03:08:47,359 --> 03:08:49,680
where you want the inductive bias

4969
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:50,720
to have

4970
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:52,640
limited false positives and false

4971
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:54,960
negatives with respect to the empirical

4972
03:08:54,960 --> 03:08:57,359
world like you wouldn't want to waste

4973
03:08:57,359 --> 03:08:59,200
time

4974
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:02,399
spitting out logics that cannot be

4975
03:09:02,399 --> 03:09:04,160
however that might not be lethal but it

4976
03:09:04,160 --> 03:09:06,319
certainly wastes a lot of time and then

4977
03:09:06,319 --> 03:09:08,720
conversely what could be lethal would be

4978
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:10,800
to have an inductive bias that fails to

4979
03:09:10,800 --> 03:09:13,439
recognize empirical aspects of the world

4980
03:09:13,439 --> 03:09:15,200
and so that is like an expectation

4981
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:16,640
maximization

4982
03:09:16,640 --> 03:09:19,680
but transposing not between a continuous

4983
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:21,680
and a discrete statistical space but

4984
03:09:21,680 --> 03:09:23,439
rather between a statistical and a

4985
03:09:23,439 --> 03:09:26,560
logical space

4986
03:09:26,560 --> 03:09:28,640
so jacob or oh yes

4987
03:09:28,640 --> 03:09:30,239
or bruno anyone who would like to add to

4988
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:32,880
that please

4989
03:09:33,359 --> 03:09:34,880
no jaekov

4990
03:09:34,880 --> 03:09:37,120
you haven't said much please

4991
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:40,239
but yeah i can say something afterwards

4992
03:09:40,239 --> 03:09:43,279
um yeah i just had some

4993
03:09:43,279 --> 03:09:46,160
general uh questions that are kind of

4994
03:09:46,160 --> 03:09:47,600
related to

4995
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:48,479
um

4996
03:09:48,479 --> 03:09:51,200
daniel's remark on the move between the

4997
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:52,880
purely continuous and statistical

4998
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:54,720
representation of the generative models

4999
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:57,920
into the discrete and

5000
03:09:57,920 --> 03:09:59,680
since this week i've been reading the

5001
03:09:59,680 --> 03:10:01,279
paper on

5002
03:10:01,279 --> 03:10:05,520
from chris fields and carl um and others

5003
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:07,359
on the fep and

5004
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:09,920
neuromorphic development i'm wondering

5005
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:11,120
whether

5006
03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:14,560
the question of structure learning

5007
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:15,680
can be

5008
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:17,439
solved by

5009
03:10:17,439 --> 03:10:19,520
some fundamental computations that are

5010
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:22,080
available at the very

5011
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:23,600
low um

5012
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:27,359
low dimensional level of just quantum

5013
03:10:27,359 --> 03:10:29,600
quantum systems where

5014
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:30,720
given

5015
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:33,279
given the right

5016
03:10:33,279 --> 03:10:35,680
environment that system would naturally

5017
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:37,840
evolve into some kind of

5018
03:10:37,840 --> 03:10:40,319
discrete morphology that it didn't start

5019
03:10:40,319 --> 03:10:42,479
with kind of similar to like the

5020
03:10:42,479 --> 03:10:44,479
primordial soup then evolving into

5021
03:10:44,479 --> 03:10:46,720
discrete uh or

5022
03:10:46,720 --> 03:10:50,640
more discrete life forms

5023
03:10:50,880 --> 03:10:53,040
and whether

5024
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:54,960
and whether that

5025
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:58,080
might impose the

5026
03:10:58,080 --> 03:11:00,479
the nes the necessary um

5027
03:11:00,479 --> 03:11:02,479
structural learning principles where

5028
03:11:02,479 --> 03:11:02,850
or

5029
03:11:02,850 --> 03:11:04,080
[Music]

5030
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:05,279
um

5031
03:11:05,279 --> 03:11:08,319
message passing where each le

5032
03:11:08,319 --> 03:11:10,160
each new layer that

5033
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:11,760
evolves

5034
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:13,680
in the hierarchy is receiving

5035
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:17,600
observations from the other ones

5036
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:18,800
given by

5037
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:21,279
the new markov blanket that's

5038
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:22,960
drawn around it

5039
03:11:22,960 --> 03:11:24,000
um

5040
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,359
but then in terms of actual

5041
03:11:25,359 --> 03:11:28,399
implementation i uh

5042
03:11:28,399 --> 03:11:30,399
i'm wondering whether that requires

5043
03:11:30,399 --> 03:11:32,720
quantum computers or whether that can be

5044
03:11:32,720 --> 03:11:34,800
done with some kind of different

5045
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:38,560
architecture that is able of this uh

5046
03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:40,880
automatic um

5047
03:11:40,880 --> 03:11:45,438
uh evolution in its morphology

5048
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:48,239
also

5049
03:11:48,239 --> 03:11:49,920
bruno and then anyone else you'd like to

5050
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:51,439
add

5051
03:11:51,439 --> 03:11:55,050
um yeah very i mean very nice your your

5052
03:11:55,050 --> 03:11:56,319
[Music]

5053
03:11:56,319 --> 03:11:59,200
your question and then um just kind of

5054
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:02,560
to round up what what you were all

5055
03:12:02,560 --> 03:12:05,359
concerned about um we were just thinking

5056
03:12:05,359 --> 03:12:08,000
and remembering this this and going back

5057
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:09,120
to sums

5058
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:11,680
and there is this uh proposal some songs

5059
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:14,640
but i don't remember the authors now but

5060
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:16,800
it's this other type of architecture

5061
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:18,960
that takes into consideration

5062
03:12:18,960 --> 03:12:21,439
the the learning progress so previous

5063
03:12:21,439 --> 03:12:23,920
activations and and some sort of history

5064
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:27,520
of the winning previous winning uh notes

5065
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:28,640
and so on

5066
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:29,600
um

5067
03:12:29,600 --> 03:12:30,720
that might be

5068
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:33,040
the next step so that you can actually

5069
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:35,680
monitor what's happening over time and

5070
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:37,600
if you have one of these that it's

5071
03:12:37,600 --> 03:12:40,479
coding for error then that would include

5072
03:12:40,479 --> 03:12:43,760
the the monitoring of of the prediction

5073
03:12:43,760 --> 03:12:45,040
error

5074
03:12:45,040 --> 03:12:47,760
yeah and and it would kind of close this

5075
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:50,000
gap between continuous and discrete

5076
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:52,160
representations because then you could

5077
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:55,439
you could have it all over time

5078
03:12:55,439 --> 03:12:57,520
so i like if you one of them i can send

5079
03:12:57,520 --> 03:13:01,840
you some some literature on that that

5080
03:13:03,040 --> 03:13:04,800
thank you bruno

5081
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:07,200
one point on the morphological

5082
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:09,760
computational angle uh jacob and then

5083
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:11,760
again anyone can raise their hand

5084
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:13,200
i thought about

5085
03:13:13,200 --> 03:13:14,399
a bunch of tree

5086
03:13:14,399 --> 03:13:15,520
seeds

5087
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:17,120
we're back in frequentism again so

5088
03:13:17,120 --> 03:13:18,880
everyone can take a breath but you know

5089
03:13:18,880 --> 03:13:21,120
there's a hundred seeds that are planted

5090
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:24,560
and depending on the priors

5091
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:26,720
inherited from evolution

5092
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:29,840
and the updates which are happening from

5093
03:13:29,840 --> 03:13:31,920
the generative process from the niche

5094
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:34,479
there's gonna be like a distribution

5095
03:13:34,479 --> 03:13:36,880
of that tree through time

5096
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:39,520
so like a palm tree is gonna have a very

5097
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:41,359
like narrow

5098
03:13:41,359 --> 03:13:42,399
cone

5099
03:13:42,399 --> 03:13:44,319
some sort of distributional cone across

5100
03:13:44,319 --> 03:13:47,279
those hundred that are sampling from it

5101
03:13:47,279 --> 03:13:48,800
and then another

5102
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:51,600
a shrub might have like a different um

5103
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:53,920
shape

5104
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:57,760
then you brought up how potentially

5105
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:00,720
quantum or discrete like

5106
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:03,600
morphological decisions

5107
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:05,200
could realize

5108
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:07,600
that continuous

5109
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:09,040
probability

5110
03:14:09,040 --> 03:14:12,319
distribution at the population or even

5111
03:14:12,319 --> 03:14:16,319
like the multiple worlds level

5112
03:14:16,319 --> 03:14:18,800
and there's something there also with

5113
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:22,399
the local computation of large models

5114
03:14:22,399 --> 03:14:24,720
that carl mentioned that it's like

5115
03:14:24,720 --> 03:14:27,040
something happens

5116
03:14:27,040 --> 03:14:30,399
where there is not even just a symbolic

5117
03:14:30,399 --> 03:14:32,880
or a discrete decision that's made

5118
03:14:32,880 --> 03:14:34,720
there's an embedded decision that's

5119
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:37,120
being made that now is part of the

5120
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:39,760
history and so the branching pattern of

5121
03:14:39,760 --> 03:14:41,600
any given

5122
03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:44,000
palm tree is going to be unique or any

5123
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:45,120
given

5124
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:46,560
shrub

5125
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:49,840
yet they also may

5126
03:14:49,840 --> 03:14:52,960
fill out at the population level

5127
03:14:52,960 --> 03:14:55,439
a distribution set

5128
03:14:55,439 --> 03:14:57,600
that has these aspects that can be

5129
03:14:57,600 --> 03:15:00,000
modeled as like a gaussian blur over

5130
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,160
tree morphologies yet of course no one

5131
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:04,319
is saying that the tree is a blur

5132
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:07,040
and so there's so many interesting

5133
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:09,600
contrasts with like the realized

5134
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:13,359
trajectory of the lego robot

5135
03:15:13,359 --> 03:15:16,640
and that's the n equals one

5136
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:18,560
the population of trajectories the

5137
03:15:18,560 --> 03:15:20,960
imagined set of trajectories

5138
03:15:20,960 --> 03:15:24,399
so having a unified ontology

5139
03:15:24,399 --> 03:15:26,640
to be able to talk

5140
03:15:26,640 --> 03:15:28,160
and have formal

5141
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:30,560
concise connections

5142
03:15:30,560 --> 03:15:32,840
amongst these different kinds of

5143
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:35,760
remembered now casted

5144
03:15:35,760 --> 03:15:39,760
anticipated or imagined futures

5145
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:41,600
helps find

5146
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:43,840
the patterns across systems

5147
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:46,399
that like adam said are essentially the

5148
03:15:46,399 --> 03:15:51,039
basis of sense making and insight

5149
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:58,640
i gotta ramble

5150
03:15:58,640 --> 03:15:59,439
um

5151
03:15:59,439 --> 03:16:00,800
so

5152
03:16:00,800 --> 03:16:04,160
i guess in terms of this like um

5153
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:06,399
motion from a continuous to a discrete

5154
03:16:06,399 --> 03:16:07,439
regime

5155
03:16:07,439 --> 03:16:09,680
or even like um

5156
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:12,000
drawing analogies from like a quantum to

5157
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,600
like a more classical

5158
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:16,600
regime

5159
03:16:17,920 --> 03:16:19,600
there's a in general like i've been kind

5160
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:21,040
of like with respect to computational

5161
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:23,840
models of consciousness wondering um

5162
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:24,720
how

5163
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:27,120
um a seemingly classical world of

5164
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:29,200
experience can emerge from a problem

5165
03:16:29,200 --> 03:16:31,439
like why are things so precise

5166
03:16:31,439 --> 03:16:33,359
and or um

5167
03:16:33,359 --> 03:16:35,920
carl's written some really uh

5168
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:37,600
interesting papers with andy clark on

5169
03:16:37,600 --> 03:16:38,560
this

5170
03:16:38,560 --> 03:16:42,000
um on the bayesian blur problem and one

5171
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:45,120
of the suggestions was that like

5172
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:46,160
um

5173
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:48,720
the discretization for the sake

5174
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:50,479
of action

5175
03:16:50,479 --> 03:16:53,279
like in order to act you have to act in

5176
03:16:53,279 --> 03:16:55,600
a particular way and it's like just the

5177
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:56,960
requirements

5178
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:58,560
of doing a particular thing at a

5179
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:01,520
particular time induces this

5180
03:17:01,520 --> 03:17:03,760
and so one of the things um and so this

5181
03:17:03,760 --> 03:17:05,040
is

5182
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:07,200
i don't think it's come uh

5183
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:09,279
competing but in some ways competes for

5184
03:17:09,279 --> 03:17:10,880
like a suggestion i had all those things

5185
03:17:10,880 --> 03:17:12,800
compatible because like i was wondering

5186
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:15,680
whether basically like um

5187
03:17:15,680 --> 03:17:17,840
something about the the time scales in

5188
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:19,840
which you could get like these

5189
03:17:19,840 --> 03:17:21,439
um

5190
03:17:21,439 --> 03:17:23,279
coherent eigen modes or like the

5191
03:17:23,279 --> 03:17:25,760
population activity could achieve these

5192
03:17:25,760 --> 03:17:27,439
like attracting states

5193
03:17:27,439 --> 03:17:29,439
would create like the time skills of the

5194
03:17:29,439 --> 03:17:31,279
formation of these large-scale

5195
03:17:31,279 --> 03:17:33,120
attractors could create like an in and

5196
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:33,920
out

5197
03:17:33,920 --> 03:17:35,520
of like who gets to inform or not and

5198
03:17:35,520 --> 03:17:36,960
this could help to like sharpen things

5199
03:17:36,960 --> 03:17:37,680
up

5200
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:39,520
and and like creating these population

5201
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:41,439
level attractors but there's another way

5202
03:17:41,439 --> 03:17:42,800
of describing it in terms of like what

5203
03:17:42,800 --> 03:17:44,239
lets you act

5204
03:17:44,239 --> 03:17:46,160
um so

5205
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:47,439
in terms of like

5206
03:17:47,439 --> 03:17:48,399
uh

5207
03:17:48,399 --> 03:17:49,920
like these different

5208
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:51,680
uh

5209
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:53,840
it's one more comment along those lines

5210
03:17:53,840 --> 03:17:54,800
is um

5211
03:17:54,800 --> 03:17:56,880
i think it's interesting that like so um

5212
03:17:56,880 --> 03:17:59,359
i've talked to some rodent researchers

5213
03:17:59,359 --> 03:18:00,080
and

5214
03:18:00,080 --> 03:18:00,800
you

5215
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:02,479
when you remove the hippocampus you'll

5216
03:18:02,479 --> 03:18:04,080
still actually get

5217
03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:04,880
um

5218
03:18:04,880 --> 03:18:07,200
like roughly theta stale

5219
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:08,880
theta scale

5220
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:09,680
um

5221
03:18:09,680 --> 03:18:10,479
like

5222
03:18:10,479 --> 03:18:12,319
large mesoscale

5223
03:18:12,319 --> 03:18:13,840
organization of brain dynamics for the

5224
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:14,800
rest of

5225
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:16,560
the rodents nervous system

5226
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:20,960
so it seems like there's almost a um

5227
03:18:20,960 --> 03:18:22,160
it might be and i don't know if you see

5228
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:23,840
it's like degenerate but it's like

5229
03:18:23,840 --> 03:18:25,279
natural selection

5230
03:18:25,279 --> 03:18:29,680
like any mode any any way it could

5231
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:31,520
catalyze things to help with the

5232
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:33,359
coordination to help with

5233
03:18:33,359 --> 03:18:34,880
the alignment the spatial temporal

5234
03:18:34,880 --> 03:18:38,160
alignment of um

5235
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:39,920
that allow that collab for different

5236
03:18:39,920 --> 03:18:41,520
forms of synchronization

5237
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:42,640
um

5238
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:44,880
was utilized so like there's like you

5239
03:18:44,880 --> 03:18:46,080
could get for instance a good amount of

5240
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:47,680
discretization just from like

5241
03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:49,120
potentially just from like learning and

5242
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:51,279
interacting with the world that requires

5243
03:18:51,279 --> 03:18:52,560
you to do this just physically to

5244
03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:55,120
interface with it you get some of it

5245
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:57,600
from like the overall um

5246
03:18:57,600 --> 03:18:59,439
connectomic properties just like that's

5247
03:18:59,439 --> 03:19:01,680
the times like um

5248
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:03,359
that's what's required for the the you

5249
03:19:03,359 --> 03:19:04,399
know the overall brain to form

5250
03:19:04,399 --> 03:19:05,920
attractors that they'll form at a

5251
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:07,359
certain time scale and different nervous

5252
03:19:07,359 --> 03:19:09,760
systems of different size and complexity

5253
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:11,200
with different bottle like information

5254
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:13,200
bottlenecks might tend to form these

5255
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:14,960
attracting states roughly

5256
03:19:14,960 --> 03:19:16,399
on that same scale and maybe things are

5257
03:19:16,399 --> 03:19:17,840
tuned for that or maybe they get tuned

5258
03:19:17,840 --> 03:19:20,160
by experience either as an innate

5259
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:21,920
inductive bias or as a

5260
03:19:21,920 --> 03:19:24,800
empirical uh meta prior learning or

5261
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:25,840
learned

5262
03:19:25,840 --> 03:19:26,960
you'd also get it with things like the

5263
03:19:26,960 --> 03:19:28,960
local logic of like um how you

5264
03:19:28,960 --> 03:19:30,000
transition between these different

5265
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:31,279
equilibrium points for like highly

5266
03:19:31,279 --> 03:19:32,880
central structures

5267
03:19:32,880 --> 03:19:35,040
and so um something is very unclear to

5268
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:36,800
me is like the extent i imagine the

5269
03:19:36,800 --> 03:19:39,279
answer is like all of you above

5270
03:19:39,279 --> 03:19:41,600
in like most combinations but it's like

5271
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:43,040
to what degree

5272
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:43,460
um

5273
03:19:43,460 --> 03:19:44,960
[Music]

5274
03:19:44,960 --> 03:19:47,359
were these um inductive biases are they

5275
03:19:47,359 --> 03:19:49,279
taking the form of evolutionary priors

5276
03:19:49,279 --> 03:19:50,560
and to what degree are they

5277
03:19:50,560 --> 03:19:52,560
developmental priors this is still very

5278
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:56,319
unclear to me um but one thing that um

5279
03:19:56,319 --> 03:19:59,120
and there seems to be a tension in uh

5280
03:19:59,120 --> 03:20:00,960
machine learning in terms of these like

5281
03:20:00,960 --> 03:20:03,840
you want these rich inductive priors to

5282
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:05,040
do efficient inference and learning

5283
03:20:05,040 --> 03:20:07,040
because otherwise it's hopeless but you

5284
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:09,359
pay a price in terms of generalization

5285
03:20:09,359 --> 03:20:10,560
sometimes

5286
03:20:10,560 --> 03:20:12,479
and so i have no idea how nature

5287
03:20:12,479 --> 03:20:13,760
balances

5288
03:20:13,760 --> 03:20:16,239
to what extent in what cases um all

5289
03:20:16,239 --> 03:20:18,000
right i have some idea but not nearly

5290
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,600
enough to feel comfortable

5291
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:23,600
so anyways that's my ramble

5292
03:20:25,279 --> 03:20:27,520
i think we can actually hinge on this

5293
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:30,319
and bring it to an area that some of the

5294
03:20:30,319 --> 03:20:31,520
registrants

5295
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:33,040
brought up and also something probably

5296
03:20:33,040 --> 03:20:34,800
many of us have been thinking about

5297
03:20:34,800 --> 03:20:37,200
which is multi-agent modeling

5298
03:20:37,200 --> 03:20:39,120
and i wanted to connect that to what

5299
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:42,399
adam was just saying um

5300
03:20:42,399 --> 03:20:43,600
about

5301
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:46,000
what is granted

5302
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:47,760
via embeddedness

5303
03:20:47,760 --> 03:20:51,200
what arises or becomes more possible

5304
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:54,080
simply as a function of realized

5305
03:20:54,080 --> 03:20:56,880
corporal embodiment as opposed to

5306
03:20:56,880 --> 03:20:58,720
in silico simulation

5307
03:20:58,720 --> 03:21:01,840
and in our multi-agent discussions

5308
03:21:01,840 --> 03:21:04,399
we've been differentiating spatial

5309
03:21:04,399 --> 03:21:06,399
multi-agent scenarios

5310
03:21:06,399 --> 03:21:07,359
from

5311
03:21:07,359 --> 03:21:10,399
essentially non-spatial like digital or

5312
03:21:10,399 --> 03:21:13,439
cognitive so in the spatial multi-agent

5313
03:21:13,439 --> 03:21:14,800
case

5314
03:21:14,800 --> 03:21:17,120
the real world the niche the generative

5315
03:21:17,120 --> 03:21:20,479
process does the work of inducing or

5316
03:21:20,479 --> 03:21:22,319
preventing collisions like it just

5317
03:21:22,319 --> 03:21:24,880
cannot be the case that two entities are

5318
03:21:24,880 --> 03:21:27,120
in the same location

5319
03:21:27,120 --> 03:21:29,760
whereas in the cognitive case whether

5320
03:21:29,760 --> 03:21:32,720
it's bird song or a negotiation or

5321
03:21:32,720 --> 03:21:34,399
verbal communication or visiting

5322
03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:36,880
websites we can both be at the same

5323
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:40,160
website and so then there's sort of a

5324
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:43,600
mass parallel stigma g occurring or a

5325
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:46,560
mass parallel real-time architecture

5326
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:49,120
where there is some kind of coordination

5327
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:51,359
but the coordination isn't exclusionary

5328
03:21:51,359 --> 03:21:53,439
again because two entities could their

5329
03:21:53,439 --> 03:21:55,920
thought trains could essentially cross

5330
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:57,680
in and out and those trains are like

5331
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:00,239
ghost trains that don't exclude each

5332
03:22:00,239 --> 03:22:02,080
other whereas that couldn't happen in

5333
03:22:02,080 --> 03:22:03,439
the real world

5334
03:22:03,439 --> 03:22:04,239
so

5335
03:22:04,239 --> 03:22:08,239
i wanted to ask anyone who had thoughts

5336
03:22:08,239 --> 03:22:12,080
how does multi-agent modeling come into

5337
03:22:12,080 --> 03:22:14,239
play for robotics

5338
03:22:14,239 --> 03:22:17,120
what current issues are facing

5339
03:22:17,120 --> 03:22:19,359
multi-agent robotics

5340
03:22:19,359 --> 03:22:21,600
and how can what we're discussing here

5341
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:23,520
with active inference play a role

5342
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:26,319
specifically in understanding complex

5343
03:22:26,319 --> 03:22:29,840
multi-agent scenarios

5344
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:35,760
i i have a question in that regard uh

5345
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:37,359
for matt

5346
03:22:37,359 --> 03:22:39,760
matt your solution has been applied to a

5347
03:22:39,760 --> 03:22:41,439
single agent

5348
03:22:41,439 --> 03:22:43,439
uh do you see the

5349
03:22:43,439 --> 03:22:45,359
possibility of a homeostat that is

5350
03:22:45,359 --> 03:22:47,520
composed of multiple agents

5351
03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:50,239
that will direct their collaboration

5352
03:22:50,239 --> 03:22:52,319
towards achieving

5353
03:22:52,319 --> 03:22:54,800
a common goal does it scale to

5354
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:56,239
multi-agent

5355
03:22:56,239 --> 03:22:58,960
situations

5356
03:23:00,560 --> 03:23:02,880
thanks i hope matt can provide a thought

5357
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:04,319
as is

5358
03:23:04,319 --> 03:23:07,840
working carl and then anyone else

5359
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:09,840
where is matt

5360
03:23:09,840 --> 03:23:11,040
listening

5361
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:14,640
oh is he can he speak

5362
03:23:14,640 --> 03:23:16,960
only at a future point in an expected

5363
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:20,000
trajectory i will answer for him then i

5364
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,239
would imagine uh what he would say is if

5365
03:23:22,239 --> 03:23:24,399
you just take the the generalized

5366
03:23:24,399 --> 03:23:27,680
synchrony uh perspective on with the

5367
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:30,960
emerging properties of a homeostat

5368
03:23:30,960 --> 03:23:33,439
coupled to its environment and you

5369
03:23:33,439 --> 03:23:36,399
couple two homeostats together they will

5370
03:23:36,399 --> 03:23:39,120
find a mutual homeostasis that just will

5371
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:42,319
be a joint synchronization manifold so

5372
03:23:42,319 --> 03:23:44,319
what you'd expect to see is a coming

5373
03:23:44,319 --> 03:23:48,319
together exactly um um in the spirit of

5374
03:23:48,319 --> 03:23:51,439
uh dynamical generalized synchronization

5375
03:23:51,439 --> 03:23:52,720
and so

5376
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:54,560
there will be as i think daniel

5377
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:56,160
mentioned earlier on though

5378
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,000
the homeostats will be singing from the

5379
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:00,080
same hymn sheet under the constraints of

5380
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:01,920
what they can communicate

5381
03:24:01,920 --> 03:24:04,560
um so um so

5382
03:24:04,560 --> 03:24:06,399
from i think from matt's point of view

5383
03:24:06,399 --> 03:24:07,840
he's more interested though in

5384
03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:09,439
establishing a generalized synchrony

5385
03:24:09,439 --> 03:24:12,319
between a a use case an industrial use

5386
03:24:12,319 --> 03:24:13,520
case

5387
03:24:13,520 --> 03:24:16,000
and his homeostat as opposed to just

5388
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,080
letting two homeostats you know shape

5389
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:21,840
and design their own little economy

5390
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:23,359
indulgence sort of cultural niche

5391
03:24:23,359 --> 03:24:25,359
construction while i'm talking though

5392
03:24:25,359 --> 03:24:27,359
that it was a nice uh

5393
03:24:27,359 --> 03:24:28,640
something very interesting about

5394
03:24:28,640 --> 03:24:30,800
daniel's question in relation to to your

5395
03:24:30,800 --> 03:24:33,439
work um

5396
03:24:33,439 --> 03:24:35,600
i i sort of overheard the little robots

5397
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:36,720
telling each other what they were

5398
03:24:36,720 --> 03:24:39,120
thinking um and i thought that was

5399
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:41,279
really important um

5400
03:24:41,279 --> 03:24:43,760
and simply because um

5401
03:24:43,760 --> 03:24:44,960
you know speaking to this general

5402
03:24:44,960 --> 03:24:47,359
question about you know what does active

5403
03:24:47,359 --> 03:24:48,940
inference or what

5404
03:24:48,940 --> 03:24:50,080
[Music]

5405
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:52,319
what are the special considerations that

5406
03:24:52,319 --> 03:24:53,760
you might want to bring to the table

5407
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:56,960
when thinking about a multi-agent um

5408
03:24:56,960 --> 03:24:58,479
setting i think

5409
03:24:58,479 --> 03:25:00,000
there are two ways we could talk about

5410
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,720
ages about this first of all it's having

5411
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:04,640
the law of requisite variety across

5412
03:25:04,640 --> 03:25:07,120
agents and then the story would unfold

5413
03:25:07,120 --> 03:25:08,800
in terms of natural selections bayesian

5414
03:25:08,800 --> 03:25:10,479
model selection and that would i think

5415
03:25:10,479 --> 03:25:12,160
answering large parts of adam's

5416
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:14,239
questions about where the inductive

5417
03:25:14,239 --> 03:25:16,880
biases come from if you cast that the

5418
03:25:16,880 --> 03:25:18,960
biases as selection biases we're just

5419
03:25:18,960 --> 03:25:20,880
talking about basic model selection

5420
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:23,200
selection amongst what the requisite

5421
03:25:23,200 --> 03:25:26,880
varieties afforded by ashby's law uh but

5422
03:25:26,880 --> 03:25:28,560
to make that bayesian model selection

5423
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:30,479
work you have to have natural selection

5424
03:25:30,479 --> 03:25:33,040
um so you know there's a great story

5425
03:25:33,040 --> 03:25:36,160
about the importance of um multiple

5426
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:37,279
agents

5427
03:25:37,279 --> 03:25:39,279
um from that point of view from the

5428
03:25:39,279 --> 03:25:41,439
point of view of structure learning

5429
03:25:41,439 --> 03:25:45,279
for free as an emergent property of

5430
03:25:45,279 --> 03:25:47,680
of natural basic model selection or

5431
03:25:47,680 --> 03:25:49,520
natural structural learning

5432
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:52,479
but the other the other thing is um

5433
03:25:52,479 --> 03:25:54,239
just from the point of view of active

5434
03:25:54,239 --> 03:25:57,520
inference if you've got multiple agents

5435
03:25:57,520 --> 03:26:00,160
um what's to stop you thinking about

5436
03:26:00,160 --> 03:26:03,359
these multiple agents as one big agent

5437
03:26:03,359 --> 03:26:05,200
where you've cut some message passing

5438
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:08,399
between them um and like one big agent

5439
03:26:08,399 --> 03:26:10,640
with lots and lots of eyes and sensors

5440
03:26:10,640 --> 03:26:11,840
and the like

5441
03:26:11,840 --> 03:26:15,120
so i'm asking now when i looked at carla

5442
03:26:15,120 --> 03:26:16,800
and andy

5443
03:26:16,800 --> 03:26:19,359
what's to stop me thinking about carla

5444
03:26:19,359 --> 03:26:21,840
and andy as one agent

5445
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:25,120
that has a really um flexible and

5446
03:26:25,120 --> 03:26:27,760
deployable set of sensors so they've got

5447
03:26:27,760 --> 03:26:28,960
eyes that can point in different

5448
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:31,520
directions so if we translate this into

5449
03:26:31,520 --> 03:26:32,800
sort of um

5450
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:34,640
uh you know controlling drones for

5451
03:26:34,640 --> 03:26:37,040
example and we have a swarm of drones we

5452
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:38,880
can think about that as one agent one

5453
03:26:38,880 --> 03:26:42,319
robot with lots of deployable eyes which

5454
03:26:42,319 --> 03:26:43,920
gives you you know

5455
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:47,279
an enormous flexibility um over uh

5456
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:49,279
you know and possibly complexity of the

5457
03:26:49,279 --> 03:26:51,520
way that we control our two eyes which

5458
03:26:51,520 --> 03:26:53,359
are both in front of our heads

5459
03:26:53,359 --> 03:26:56,160
um so how would you then write down a

5460
03:26:56,160 --> 03:27:00,080
concerted model for a swarm of eyes

5461
03:27:00,080 --> 03:27:03,120
where there's one cpu there's one um

5462
03:27:03,120 --> 03:27:05,279
there's one sort of uh

5463
03:27:05,279 --> 03:27:06,640
the lego brick

5464
03:27:06,640 --> 03:27:09,840
controlling all the the drones uh where

5465
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:11,439
you just write a generative model with

5466
03:27:11,439 --> 03:27:13,520
multiple sensory modalities where you

5467
03:27:13,520 --> 03:27:15,200
needed to deploy action in the right

5468
03:27:15,200 --> 03:27:16,880
kind of way to get the right epistemic

5469
03:27:16,880 --> 03:27:19,439
foraging or whatever um

5470
03:27:19,439 --> 03:27:22,399
but that would entail now um message

5471
03:27:22,399 --> 03:27:24,960
passing belief updating um lateral

5472
03:27:24,960 --> 03:27:28,399
interactions and an some

5473
03:27:28,399 --> 03:27:30,720
between the brains of agents

5474
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:32,239
so say oh you can't do that you've

5475
03:27:32,239 --> 03:27:33,279
actually got to have physically

5476
03:27:33,279 --> 03:27:35,920
separable robots to have a multi truly

5477
03:27:35,920 --> 03:27:37,520
multi-agent set up

5478
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:40,560
so how can you now

5479
03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:42,640
work around the fact you you don't have

5480
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:44,080
direct message passing and belief

5481
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:46,319
updating between the two the brains the

5482
03:27:46,319 --> 03:27:48,720
the brain the separated brains when you

5483
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:50,960
just have communication so provided you

5484
03:27:50,960 --> 03:27:53,040
broadcast what you believe

5485
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:55,359
and provided those beliefs are

5486
03:27:55,359 --> 03:27:56,399
perspective

5487
03:27:56,399 --> 03:27:59,040
independent so they're conserved

5488
03:27:59,040 --> 03:28:01,200
from you know so that they you know what

5489
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:04,000
i say in terms of my frame of reference

5490
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:07,040
um is meaningful from your point of

5491
03:28:07,040 --> 03:28:09,200
frame of reference which incidentally

5492
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:12,160
for daniel and uh jacob

5493
03:28:12,160 --> 03:28:14,479
becomes relevant from point of quantum

5494
03:28:14,479 --> 03:28:16,479
frames of reference here but if we can

5495
03:28:16,479 --> 03:28:17,920
assume we're all got the same we've all

5496
03:28:17,920 --> 03:28:18,960
got an

5497
03:28:18,960 --> 03:28:21,520
alice-centric frame of reference then

5498
03:28:21,520 --> 03:28:24,880
all of it is required to put together

5499
03:28:24,880 --> 03:28:25,680
the

5500
03:28:25,680 --> 03:28:28,800
the many brains into one brain um is to

5501
03:28:28,800 --> 03:28:31,359
have beliefs broadcast

5502
03:28:31,359 --> 03:28:33,760
just those beliefs that that will that

5503
03:28:33,760 --> 03:28:37,439
will um that are conserved or shared in

5504
03:28:37,439 --> 03:28:40,960
the uh the ensembles generative model so

5505
03:28:40,960 --> 03:28:42,399
you know i don't know

5506
03:28:42,399 --> 03:28:45,840
where your was carla able to hear

5507
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:48,239
andy and vice versa

5508
03:28:48,239 --> 03:28:50,000
so when did did they actually share a

5509
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:52,560
narrative in a belief updating

5510
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:56,560
no they did not they they uh the the

5511
03:28:56,560 --> 03:28:58,640
the speaking was uh the talking was

5512
03:28:58,640 --> 03:29:01,279
mostly for my benefit so i could see

5513
03:29:01,279 --> 03:29:04,319
what was going in their mind at the time

5514
03:29:04,319 --> 03:29:08,399
so when when uh uh carl was saying oh

5515
03:29:08,399 --> 03:29:11,200
andy is freaking out i knew that the

5516
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:13,600
journal of model had identified the

5517
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:16,399
behavior and and and

5518
03:29:16,399 --> 03:29:18,880
inferred

5519
03:29:19,200 --> 03:29:21,840
the mindset of the other robot

5520
03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:25,840
but i i am uh playing with the idea that

5521
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:28,560
they can communicate um

5522
03:29:28,560 --> 03:29:31,040
by just distributed message

5523
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:33,359
passing from one robot to the other and

5524
03:29:33,359 --> 03:29:35,439
what they would communicate

5525
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:37,279
is is uh

5526
03:29:37,279 --> 03:29:39,680
essentially

5527
03:29:39,680 --> 03:29:41,279
if

5528
03:29:41,279 --> 03:29:46,479
i would consider one agent as as a

5529
03:29:46,479 --> 03:29:49,040
source of sensation

5530
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:51,840
for another agent and and in the same

5531
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:55,040
way that internally journal models uh

5532
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:57,120
the beliefs of a general model becomes a

5533
03:29:57,120 --> 03:29:58,399
sensation

5534
03:29:58,399 --> 03:30:01,840
of of another higher level genetic model

5535
03:30:01,840 --> 03:30:04,880
that could scale across multiple agents

5536
03:30:04,880 --> 03:30:07,120
and and that would happen by

5537
03:30:07,120 --> 03:30:08,800
communicating

5538
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:09,760
these

5539
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:11,200
these

5540
03:30:11,200 --> 03:30:13,600
predictions across agents in this

5541
03:30:13,600 --> 03:30:16,160
prediction errors across agent as they

5542
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:18,239
propagate between general evolves within

5543
03:30:18,239 --> 03:30:20,399
a single agent and just scale the

5544
03:30:20,399 --> 03:30:22,960
architecture so instead of having a

5545
03:30:22,960 --> 03:30:25,279
society of mind within an agent which

5546
03:30:25,279 --> 03:30:28,080
would also have a society of minds

5547
03:30:28,080 --> 03:30:30,319
across agent in the same mechanisms

5548
03:30:30,319 --> 03:30:31,760
would be at play but you're absolutely

5549
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:34,640
right we need to have this communication

5550
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:35,840
but it would be the same kind of

5551
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:37,040
communication

5552
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:38,160
within

5553
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:40,160
uh across society of minds as they would

5554
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:42,399
be within society of mind i'm hoping

5555
03:30:42,399 --> 03:30:44,479
that they would be self-similar

5556
03:30:44,479 --> 03:30:46,319
and the same architecture would apply at

5557
03:30:46,319 --> 03:30:48,560
any scale

5558
03:30:48,560 --> 03:30:50,239
which actually speaks to jacob's

5559
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:52,960
question uh about your mark off blankets

5560
03:30:52,960 --> 03:30:54,640
and mark off blankets and sort of you

5561
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:56,800
know that sparse do you get from from

5562
03:30:56,800 --> 03:30:58,479
that scale-free

5563
03:30:58,479 --> 03:31:00,800
separation and you know refined

5564
03:31:00,800 --> 03:31:02,960
minimally complex message passing i

5565
03:31:02,960 --> 03:31:03,680
think there's something quite

5566
03:31:03,680 --> 03:31:05,439
fundamental there about you know the

5567
03:31:05,439 --> 03:31:08,399
nature of communities and the

5568
03:31:08,399 --> 03:31:10,399
the scale of the world in which we live

5569
03:31:10,399 --> 03:31:13,600
and all the organs that comprise me

5570
03:31:13,600 --> 03:31:15,840
living in that world that that scale

5571
03:31:15,840 --> 03:31:18,560
free aspect that is defined by the

5572
03:31:18,560 --> 03:31:22,080
sparsity and the absence of coupling and

5573
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:23,920
and getting the messages that are

5574
03:31:23,920 --> 03:31:26,160
communicated right i i think something

5575
03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:29,279
quite fundamental about that

5576
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:31,760
i got a question adam please

5577
03:31:31,760 --> 03:31:34,000
um

5578
03:31:34,720 --> 03:31:37,200
so for the internal

5579
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:38,239
uh

5580
03:31:38,239 --> 03:31:40,880
organism internal case i'm wondering so

5581
03:31:40,880 --> 03:31:43,439
to what degree do you get um common

5582
03:31:43,439 --> 03:31:45,200
agency for

5583
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:47,760
um societies of minds due to common

5584
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:50,080
embodiment but when we're going for a

5585
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:51,279
kind of

5586
03:31:51,279 --> 03:31:52,239
common

5587
03:31:52,239 --> 03:31:54,399
uh or joint agency

5588
03:31:54,399 --> 03:31:55,120
and

5589
03:31:55,120 --> 03:31:57,040
maybe even different forms of joint

5590
03:31:57,040 --> 03:32:00,479
identification or de-individuation

5591
03:32:00,479 --> 03:32:01,520
um

5592
03:32:01,520 --> 03:32:04,160
or re-individuation of individuals into

5593
03:32:04,160 --> 03:32:05,439
a collective

5594
03:32:05,439 --> 03:32:07,359
um to what degree do we need something

5595
03:32:07,359 --> 03:32:09,279
like um

5596
03:32:09,279 --> 03:32:12,080
as constraining as a joint embodiment

5597
03:32:12,080 --> 03:32:13,200
like for instance like i'm thinking of

5598
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:14,399
like um

5599
03:32:14,399 --> 03:32:17,040
uh soldiers marking and like marching in

5600
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:18,640
step or like the ways in which like we

5601
03:32:18,640 --> 03:32:20,399
kind of like seem to like potentially

5602
03:32:20,399 --> 03:32:22,560
even like expand and hack our body maps

5603
03:32:22,560 --> 03:32:24,160
by like sharing like

5604
03:32:24,160 --> 03:32:25,359
different synchronous modes you know

5605
03:32:25,359 --> 03:32:28,319
that literature is somewhat contested um

5606
03:32:28,319 --> 03:32:31,040
i like the literature but um the

5607
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:32,960
but to what degree is it

5608
03:32:32,960 --> 03:32:34,000
you don't need to have that kind of

5609
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:36,080
synchrony though it's just like a strong

5610
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:38,080
enough shared task

5611
03:32:38,080 --> 03:32:40,239
is enough to like

5612
03:32:40,239 --> 03:32:41,200
um

5613
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:44,160
radically make someone uh

5614
03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:46,640
make the central thing their role of

5615
03:32:46,640 --> 03:32:48,399
where they're singing in the hem sheet

5616
03:32:48,399 --> 03:32:50,399
that becomes the primary attractor

5617
03:32:50,399 --> 03:32:52,239
governing them and you don't need to

5618
03:32:52,239 --> 03:32:53,840
like um

5619
03:32:53,840 --> 03:32:56,239
necessarily have this this kind of

5620
03:32:56,239 --> 03:32:57,680
physicality

5621
03:32:57,680 --> 03:32:58,720
i don't know if that makes sense but

5622
03:32:58,720 --> 03:33:00,319
like i'm think of the different means in

5623
03:33:00,319 --> 03:33:03,200
which you yes do you need something like

5624
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:05,359
synchronous in time or is it just a very

5625
03:33:05,359 --> 03:33:07,920
strong

5626
03:33:08,080 --> 03:33:09,279
pressure selective pressure for

5627
03:33:09,279 --> 03:33:10,560
coordination to establish a

5628
03:33:10,560 --> 03:33:12,399
synchronization manifold

5629
03:33:12,399 --> 03:33:13,680
to create to pull off the

5630
03:33:13,680 --> 03:33:16,680
re-individuation

5631
03:33:20,479 --> 03:33:23,040
oh it's a great question adam so thank

5632
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:24,319
you

5633
03:33:24,319 --> 03:33:25,840
i also

5634
03:33:25,840 --> 03:33:29,120
think this ties to again js framing of

5635
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:31,520
society of mind and then we can contrast

5636
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:33,680
that with a society of bodies so the

5637
03:33:33,680 --> 03:33:35,439
society of mind

5638
03:33:35,439 --> 03:33:38,319
is that virtualized case

5639
03:33:38,319 --> 03:33:40,200
whether it's the counterfactual

5640
03:33:40,200 --> 03:33:42,960
virtualizations that cognitive entities

5641
03:33:42,960 --> 03:33:45,120
can be modeled as doing or whether it

5642
03:33:45,120 --> 03:33:47,200
might even be a society of minds in a

5643
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:48,960
digital setting

5644
03:33:48,960 --> 03:33:51,120
and then there's the societies of bodies

5645
03:33:51,120 --> 03:33:53,439
which maps earlier to our multi-agent

5646
03:33:53,439 --> 03:33:56,399
discussion on like a physical crowd so

5647
03:33:56,399 --> 03:33:57,680
like what are the similarities and

5648
03:33:57,680 --> 03:34:00,000
differences with the digital swarm and a

5649
03:34:00,000 --> 03:34:01,279
physical one

5650
03:34:01,279 --> 03:34:04,479
it comes down a lot to their ability to

5651
03:34:04,479 --> 03:34:07,200
collide and again the digital swarm can

5652
03:34:07,200 --> 03:34:08,640
weave in and out because they can

5653
03:34:08,640 --> 03:34:10,319
coexist in the same location in a

5654
03:34:10,319 --> 03:34:12,720
semantic space in that generalized

5655
03:34:12,720 --> 03:34:16,239
foraging way whereas the embodied swarm

5656
03:34:16,239 --> 03:34:18,239
is going to have collision

5657
03:34:18,239 --> 03:34:19,520
prevention

5658
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:21,600
by virtue of the physicality

5659
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:24,720
and i think by using active inference to

5660
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:27,040
study these systems and integrate them

5661
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:29,760
we do approach exactly what you brought

5662
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:31,439
up adam which is like

5663
03:34:31,439 --> 03:34:32,399
almost

5664
03:34:32,399 --> 03:34:33,920
what do we

5665
03:34:33,920 --> 03:34:35,200
get

5666
03:34:35,200 --> 03:34:37,040
through shared tasks

5667
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:39,040
as opposed to what do we get from a

5668
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:42,000
common task something that we merely

5669
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:43,600
have in common

5670
03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:45,120
versus something that we're actively

5671
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:46,960
coordinating on together

5672
03:34:46,960 --> 03:34:48,479
and potentially even coordinating

5673
03:34:48,479 --> 03:34:51,359
together in the same exact space or on

5674
03:34:51,359 --> 03:34:53,840
the same instance of which provides the

5675
03:34:53,840 --> 03:34:56,239
most constraints like if people are

5676
03:34:56,239 --> 03:34:58,319
rowing the same boat versus rowing

5677
03:34:58,319 --> 03:35:00,560
parallel boats versus on different lakes

5678
03:35:00,560 --> 03:35:02,960
so as we sort of

5679
03:35:02,960 --> 03:35:04,640
separate spatially

5680
03:35:04,640 --> 03:35:07,680
and especially virtualize there becomes

5681
03:35:07,680 --> 03:35:10,479
more and more possibilities

5682
03:35:10,479 --> 03:35:14,479
um and this for those who are coming for

5683
03:35:14,479 --> 03:35:16,800
perhaps from a robotics angle

5684
03:35:16,800 --> 03:35:18,800
and wanting to understand what active

5685
03:35:18,800 --> 03:35:21,040
inference brings to the picture here

5686
03:35:21,040 --> 03:35:22,319
hopefully we've

5687
03:35:22,319 --> 03:35:24,880
pointed a few things like the scale-free

5688
03:35:24,880 --> 03:35:26,960
or scale-friendly nature

5689
03:35:26,960 --> 03:35:29,600
of models to be composed based upon

5690
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:32,479
their sparsity and defined interfaces

5691
03:35:32,479 --> 03:35:35,200
and also the multi-modal aspect for

5692
03:35:35,200 --> 03:35:39,200
example carl asked jf if the audio could

5693
03:35:39,200 --> 03:35:40,640
be heard

5694
03:35:40,640 --> 03:35:43,279
rather than only emitted

5695
03:35:43,279 --> 03:35:46,080
and that's not going to require some

5696
03:35:46,080 --> 03:35:49,600
bolted on communication module

5697
03:35:49,600 --> 03:35:52,000
it is going to be able in the symbolic

5698
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:54,319
or in the numerical case

5699
03:35:54,319 --> 03:35:58,239
to be mapped onto an architecture that

5700
03:35:58,239 --> 03:35:59,680
also

5701
03:35:59,680 --> 03:36:02,640
bruno showed these architectures that

5702
03:36:02,640 --> 03:36:03,680
can do

5703
03:36:03,680 --> 03:36:05,680
sensor integration

5704
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:08,560
as a function of the interface

5705
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:10,880
definitions locally

5706
03:36:10,880 --> 03:36:14,319
rather than potentially have ad hoc

5707
03:36:14,319 --> 03:36:16,640
structural design decisions

5708
03:36:16,640 --> 03:36:18,800
that could result in a lot of research

5709
03:36:18,800 --> 03:36:21,680
and engineering debt

5710
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:23,840
so happy to hear any

5711
03:36:23,840 --> 03:36:26,479
thoughts on that

5712
03:36:33,359 --> 03:36:34,399
um

5713
03:36:34,399 --> 03:36:36,160
yes god

5714
03:36:36,160 --> 03:36:37,439
um

5715
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:38,399
yeah i mean

5716
03:36:38,399 --> 03:36:40,399
yeah you're right and

5717
03:36:40,399 --> 03:36:42,560
um no i just wanted to add that we are

5718
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:44,000
working on

5719
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:45,840
on that community well

5720
03:36:45,840 --> 03:36:46,880
first

5721
03:36:46,880 --> 03:36:48,479
um

5722
03:36:48,479 --> 03:36:51,439
i come from from the very i don't know

5723
03:36:51,439 --> 03:36:52,800
like a very

5724
03:36:52,800 --> 03:36:54,479
now you could call it old-fashioned

5725
03:36:54,479 --> 03:36:56,000
school where we were

5726
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:57,680
we

5727
03:36:57,680 --> 03:37:00,080
as you can see in our implementations

5728
03:37:00,080 --> 03:37:01,120
they are

5729
03:37:01,120 --> 03:37:03,439
kind of very low level what we could say

5730
03:37:03,439 --> 03:37:05,439
low level and and coming from the

5731
03:37:05,439 --> 03:37:07,279
sensory

5732
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:10,319
interaction with the world and

5733
03:37:10,319 --> 03:37:13,439
that that is maybe why we are not or we

5734
03:37:13,439 --> 03:37:16,720
haven't been so far very concerned with

5735
03:37:16,720 --> 03:37:19,200
very high level representations known so

5736
03:37:19,200 --> 03:37:21,840
we are just dealing with very basic

5737
03:37:21,840 --> 03:37:23,680
interaction with the world

5738
03:37:23,680 --> 03:37:26,080
and at the same time

5739
03:37:26,080 --> 03:37:27,840
it's it's my belief i mean it's very

5740
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:29,680
interesting this interaction between

5741
03:37:29,680 --> 03:37:33,040
agents and so on but i think or we

5742
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:35,279
i've always thought that first we need

5743
03:37:35,279 --> 03:37:37,920
an agent that that knows itself in the

5744
03:37:37,920 --> 03:37:39,040
world

5745
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:42,479
and and has an uh its own model so like

5746
03:37:42,479 --> 03:37:45,359
a first frontier or a first blanket uh

5747
03:37:45,359 --> 03:37:46,960
as you like to call them

5748
03:37:46,960 --> 03:37:48,160
um

5749
03:37:48,160 --> 03:37:50,000
and only then

5750
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:51,040
can

5751
03:37:51,040 --> 03:37:53,520
start to understand other agents and to

5752
03:37:53,520 --> 03:37:56,640
to interact with other agents

5753
03:37:56,640 --> 03:37:59,120
um

5754
03:37:59,120 --> 03:38:00,720
yeah so

5755
03:38:00,720 --> 03:38:05,119
that that was what i wanted to tell you

5756
03:38:07,200 --> 03:38:10,000
know thyself

5757
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:13,200
carl

5758
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:14,880
there is an argument from um

5759
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:17,279
developmental neural robotics that

5760
03:38:17,279 --> 03:38:20,080
to have a true sense of self you you've

5761
03:38:20,080 --> 03:38:22,160
got to have a true sense of other and

5762
03:38:22,160 --> 03:38:24,080
you can only ever have a true sense of

5763
03:38:24,080 --> 03:38:25,840
other if there's something else out

5764
03:38:25,840 --> 03:38:27,760
there that's physically very much like

5765
03:38:27,760 --> 03:38:30,560
you so just i'm speaking now to adam's

5766
03:38:30,560 --> 03:38:33,680
uh point does it have to be uh or

5767
03:38:33,680 --> 03:38:35,520
perhaps daniel's question you know the

5768
03:38:35,520 --> 03:38:36,479
the

5769
03:38:36,479 --> 03:38:39,439
the shared body as opposed to the shared

5770
03:38:39,439 --> 03:38:42,080
the shared narrative you there

5771
03:38:42,080 --> 03:38:44,720
there is an argument uh i'm not

5772
03:38:44,720 --> 03:38:46,239
making the argument i'm just saying that

5773
03:38:46,239 --> 03:38:48,479
there could be an argument

5774
03:38:48,479 --> 03:38:51,760
that in order to disambiguate the causes

5775
03:38:51,760 --> 03:38:53,920
of some sensory consequences of an

5776
03:38:53,920 --> 03:38:55,120
action

5777
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:56,080
from

5778
03:38:56,080 --> 03:38:59,120
where the action could be made by you or

5779
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:02,640
an identical robot or me or mum

5780
03:39:02,640 --> 03:39:05,600
or me or my brother

5781
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:07,680
that is the only case in which you are

5782
03:39:07,680 --> 03:39:10,720
now going to be a need to

5783
03:39:10,720 --> 03:39:12,560
contextualize

5784
03:39:12,560 --> 03:39:15,600
and assign and attribute the agency of

5785
03:39:15,600 --> 03:39:18,319
this outcome to what to self versus

5786
03:39:18,319 --> 03:39:20,960
other in a world in which i was the only

5787
03:39:20,960 --> 03:39:23,680
object or phenotype like me i would need

5788
03:39:23,680 --> 03:39:25,199
a sense of self and i wouldn't need a

5789
03:39:25,199 --> 03:39:27,199
sense of other it's just when you have

5790
03:39:27,199 --> 03:39:29,760
multiple agents that are quite similar

5791
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:31,439
and confusable

5792
03:39:31,439 --> 03:39:33,840
um then you actually need a sense of

5793
03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:36,080
self to make sure it's not it's you and

5794
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:38,720
not me um which of course you know

5795
03:39:38,720 --> 03:39:40,960
speaks to not only theory of mind but

5796
03:39:40,960 --> 03:39:42,880
you know the essence of communication as

5797
03:39:42,880 --> 03:39:44,880
well so i'm just making that point that

5798
03:39:44,880 --> 03:39:47,120
you know um

5799
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:50,080
they're putting two robots together

5800
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:52,080
maybe as you point out once you've

5801
03:39:52,080 --> 03:39:54,399
sorted out a robot just learning how to

5802
03:39:54,399 --> 03:39:56,960
move um then

5803
03:39:56,960 --> 03:39:58,080
learning that

5804
03:39:58,080 --> 03:40:00,479
the consequences of it moving

5805
03:40:00,479 --> 03:40:02,479
could actually be reproduced by somebody

5806
03:40:02,479 --> 03:40:04,560
else and then it might develop a sense

5807
03:40:04,560 --> 03:40:06,960
of selfhood a minimal sense of selfhood

5808
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:08,720
and then i think you're in the game of

5809
03:40:08,720 --> 03:40:12,399
true theory of mind that's uh

5810
03:40:12,560 --> 03:40:15,199
yeah it's a very interesting area with

5811
03:40:15,199 --> 03:40:17,600
thinking through other minds as have

5812
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:19,279
been brought up in some of the

5813
03:40:19,279 --> 03:40:21,600
presentations and then society of mind

5814
03:40:21,600 --> 03:40:23,359
it is that

5815
03:40:23,359 --> 03:40:26,479
nesting of blankets of different kinds

5816
03:40:26,479 --> 03:40:28,239
of generative models but again using the

5817
03:40:28,239 --> 03:40:31,120
same statistical or formal machinery

5818
03:40:31,120 --> 03:40:32,960
just like we could have a nested

5819
03:40:32,960 --> 03:40:35,840
multi-level regression model where one

5820
03:40:35,840 --> 03:40:37,840
model was in kilometers and then there

5821
03:40:37,840 --> 03:40:40,479
was another model that was in degrees

5822
03:40:40,479 --> 03:40:42,150
for temperature

5823
03:40:42,150 --> 03:40:43,680
[Music]

5824
03:40:43,680 --> 03:40:46,960
and also the question about swarms and

5825
03:40:46,960 --> 03:40:48,640
collectives and groups

5826
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:51,040
comes up in biology all the time

5827
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:54,160
with different ways that people delimit

5828
03:40:54,160 --> 03:40:56,800
or qualify individuality

5829
03:40:56,800 --> 03:40:59,279
ranging from the evolutionary unit of

5830
03:40:59,279 --> 03:41:01,600
replication the kantian concept of an

5831
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:04,000
organism as the unit that is

5832
03:41:04,000 --> 03:41:06,960
teleologically closed the physiological

5833
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:09,600
individuality which might even include

5834
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:12,239
cases like symbioses the information

5835
03:41:12,239 --> 03:41:14,720
theory of individuality and different

5836
03:41:14,720 --> 03:41:16,000
ways that

5837
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:17,680
uh

5838
03:41:17,680 --> 03:41:19,439
we can look at information processing

5839
03:41:19,439 --> 03:41:21,600
and transfer in terms of what

5840
03:41:21,600 --> 03:41:23,439
individuals are

5841
03:41:23,439 --> 03:41:25,520
and uh

5842
03:41:25,520 --> 03:41:28,000
it's so fascinating how that comes into

5843
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:29,840
play with robotics

5844
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:33,199
where when we think about the

5845
03:41:33,199 --> 03:41:36,160
robots that will be interacting with us

5846
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:37,920
as a slightly different set than the

5847
03:41:37,920 --> 03:41:40,160
ones that might be working

5848
03:41:40,160 --> 03:41:42,960
underwater on a pipeline

5849
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:46,160
there like like matt showed they might

5850
03:41:46,160 --> 03:41:48,319
be able to interact with a relatively

5851
03:41:48,319 --> 03:41:50,399
simple generative process that doesn't

5852
03:41:50,399 --> 03:41:52,960
exhibit mind-like qualities

5853
03:41:52,960 --> 03:41:54,960
it's interacting with a mere active

5854
03:41:54,960 --> 03:41:57,199
inference entity but when on the other

5855
03:41:57,199 --> 03:41:59,199
side of the blanket there's another

5856
03:41:59,199 --> 03:42:01,840
adaptive active inference entity

5857
03:42:01,840 --> 03:42:04,399
and especially when it's us

5858
03:42:04,399 --> 03:42:07,279
then there's a space of

5859
03:42:07,279 --> 03:42:08,399
norms

5860
03:42:08,399 --> 03:42:10,720
and also laws

5861
03:42:10,720 --> 03:42:13,199
which are like that pseudo code

5862
03:42:13,199 --> 03:42:15,439
execution order

5863
03:42:15,439 --> 03:42:17,680
for thinking through other minds in a

5864
03:42:17,680 --> 03:42:18,800
way

5865
03:42:18,800 --> 03:42:22,239
how will robots navigate a space

5866
03:42:22,239 --> 03:42:24,560
and how will they be able to make

5867
03:42:24,560 --> 03:42:26,399
abduction

5868
03:42:26,399 --> 03:42:28,560
occur in a real-time way both in the

5869
03:42:28,560 --> 03:42:31,760
generation of novel hypotheses with

5870
03:42:31,760 --> 03:42:33,120
inductive bias

5871
03:42:33,120 --> 03:42:35,920
followed by the selection

5872
03:42:35,920 --> 03:42:36,720
of

5873
03:42:36,720 --> 03:42:38,560
trajectories of action

5874
03:42:38,560 --> 03:42:41,439
again taking into account

5875
03:42:41,439 --> 03:42:43,760
formal codified law

5876
03:42:43,760 --> 03:42:45,680
as well as the kind of state of

5877
03:42:45,680 --> 03:42:48,800
exception even or understanding when

5878
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:51,279
preferences allow for something to be so

5879
03:42:51,279 --> 03:42:52,960
strongly desired

5880
03:42:52,960 --> 03:42:54,160
that

5881
03:42:54,160 --> 03:42:56,080
how and when

5882
03:42:56,080 --> 03:42:57,840
it's uh

5883
03:42:57,840 --> 03:43:00,399
pursued

5884
03:43:00,399 --> 03:43:01,840
might not be how you pursue it in a

5885
03:43:01,840 --> 03:43:04,319
different time so there's just a lot of

5886
03:43:04,319 --> 03:43:08,319
cool threats yes adam and anyone else

5887
03:43:08,880 --> 03:43:11,439
um this is reminding me also from the uh

5888
03:43:11,439 --> 03:43:12,640
first session

5889
03:43:12,640 --> 03:43:14,319
uh uh there was mention of value

5890
03:43:14,319 --> 03:43:15,520
alignment

5891
03:43:15,520 --> 03:43:17,840
and like this seems to be like a a

5892
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:21,040
multi-scale problem in terms of like it

5893
03:43:21,040 --> 03:43:22,800
will show up just as much of like the

5894
03:43:22,800 --> 03:43:25,199
robot not stepping on your toes or you

5895
03:43:25,199 --> 03:43:26,640
know crushing your foot

5896
03:43:26,640 --> 03:43:29,520
to like um as it expands you know does

5897
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:31,760
it uh is it is it optimizing in the

5898
03:43:31,760 --> 03:43:33,439
direction are its tensors going the

5899
03:43:33,439 --> 03:43:35,120
direction that you want your tensors to

5900
03:43:35,120 --> 03:43:36,000
go of

5901
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:37,040
shaping

5902
03:43:37,040 --> 03:43:38,479
um and

5903
03:43:38,479 --> 03:43:41,279
it seems like of the proposals sometimes

5904
03:43:41,279 --> 03:43:42,960
there's um

5905
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:44,239
how did i say this like

5906
03:43:44,239 --> 03:43:45,279
uh

5907
03:43:45,279 --> 03:43:47,199
begged questions that active inference

5908
03:43:47,199 --> 03:43:49,600
may be answers so it's sort of like

5909
03:43:49,600 --> 03:43:50,720
let's say you have a framework like

5910
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:52,399
cooperative inverse reinforcement

5911
03:43:52,399 --> 03:43:54,000
learning and so there's some sort of

5912
03:43:54,000 --> 03:43:56,319
like you know so it's like you are

5913
03:43:56,319 --> 03:43:57,520
trying to like

5914
03:43:57,520 --> 03:43:59,120
roughly like optimize for the utility

5915
03:43:59,120 --> 03:44:00,880
function of the other agent so how do

5916
03:44:00,880 --> 03:44:03,199
you get this kind of like shared utility

5917
03:44:03,199 --> 03:44:04,880
but in like these like active inference

5918
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:06,479
models where like you're bootstrapping

5919
03:44:06,479 --> 03:44:08,000
minds um

5920
03:44:08,000 --> 03:44:10,000
like intersubjectively you have like

5921
03:44:10,000 --> 03:44:11,760
regimes of joint attention and thinking

5922
03:44:11,760 --> 03:44:13,359
through other minds or i mean some of

5923
03:44:13,359 --> 03:44:15,199
this work with them uh

5924
03:44:15,199 --> 03:44:17,359
i'm doing with anna uh chinitsa it's

5925
03:44:17,359 --> 03:44:19,279
like she emphasizes how like we start

5926
03:44:19,279 --> 03:44:20,160
out like

5927
03:44:20,160 --> 03:44:21,920
actually physically inside of another

5928
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:24,040
organism completely dependent like

5929
03:44:24,040 --> 03:44:26,160
homeostatically and so like you're

5930
03:44:26,160 --> 03:44:27,760
you're automatically sort of um

5931
03:44:27,760 --> 03:44:29,359
grandmothering in

5932
03:44:29,359 --> 03:44:31,520
this joint intention right from the

5933
03:44:31,520 --> 03:44:32,640
get-go

5934
03:44:32,640 --> 03:44:33,600
and

5935
03:44:33,600 --> 03:44:36,160
the seeds of um you know organization

5936
03:44:36,160 --> 03:44:38,479
and individuation are already like you

5937
03:44:38,479 --> 03:44:41,520
know scaffolded in that way just by the

5938
03:44:41,520 --> 03:44:43,520
um just by by the niche

5939
03:44:43,520 --> 03:44:45,439
contextualization where you are

5940
03:44:45,439 --> 03:44:46,800
co-constructing each other as your

5941
03:44:46,800 --> 03:44:48,479
mutual and you and me are

5942
03:44:48,479 --> 03:44:49,760
inter-subjective like mutual niche

5943
03:44:49,760 --> 03:44:51,040
construction

5944
03:44:51,040 --> 03:44:53,359
so it seems like um with respect to the

5945
03:44:53,359 --> 03:44:55,680
um i don't know at what point these

5946
03:44:55,680 --> 03:44:57,359
problems in terms of like deploying

5947
03:44:57,359 --> 03:44:59,520
robots when they first enter because you

5948
03:44:59,520 --> 03:45:01,279
know it's it's all you know always

5949
03:45:01,279 --> 03:45:03,040
highfalutin as like intelligence

5950
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:05,680
explosions really like a recursively

5951
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:08,399
amplifying system stay aligned with you

5952
03:45:08,399 --> 03:45:09,520
but just like

5953
03:45:09,520 --> 03:45:10,960
in the world

5954
03:45:10,960 --> 03:45:12,720
you know how can i make sure the robot

5955
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:13,600
like

5956
03:45:13,600 --> 03:45:16,319
doesn't crush my foot like i don't

5957
03:45:16,319 --> 03:45:17,920
anyway so um

5958
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:20,800
the ways in which um co-valuing and um

5959
03:45:20,800 --> 03:45:22,960
the the robot identifying itself as an

5960
03:45:22,960 --> 03:45:25,199
individual relative to other individuals

5961
03:45:25,199 --> 03:45:26,640
plays into it

5962
03:45:26,640 --> 03:45:28,319
it seems like active inference has like

5963
03:45:28,319 --> 03:45:30,800
a very rich way of handling and modeling

5964
03:45:30,800 --> 03:45:34,160
a lot of these different um uh

5965
03:45:34,160 --> 03:45:36,560
proposals and processes but um something

5966
03:45:36,560 --> 03:45:38,720
i wonder like from to ask like actual

5967
03:45:38,720 --> 03:45:41,359
roboticists like how near-term is it

5968
03:45:41,359 --> 03:45:44,319
like a live problem of getting like

5969
03:45:44,319 --> 03:45:47,359
what forms of social modeling for robots

5970
03:45:47,359 --> 03:45:49,920
like and what forms of like a sense of

5971
03:45:49,920 --> 03:45:53,279
self modeling for the robot like

5972
03:45:53,279 --> 03:45:55,199
how much do we need at what stage for

5973
03:45:55,199 --> 03:45:57,520
what levels of deployment in the world

5974
03:45:57,520 --> 03:46:00,880
with what degrees of robustness

5975
03:46:02,239 --> 03:46:04,800
simple question

5976
03:46:04,800 --> 03:46:06,319
great question

5977
03:46:06,319 --> 03:46:09,439
and maybe just uh to double on what

5978
03:46:09,439 --> 03:46:11,359
active inference does to potentially

5979
03:46:11,359 --> 03:46:13,520
frame that junction since

5980
03:46:13,520 --> 03:46:15,600
in this round table we won't address but

5981
03:46:15,600 --> 03:46:16,640
this is

5982
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:18,720
the stuff and substance of applied

5983
03:46:18,720 --> 03:46:20,560
active inference symposia for many years

5984
03:46:20,560 --> 03:46:21,520
to come

5985
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:24,000
in an economic framework

5986
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:27,120
a reward absolutist framework

5987
03:46:27,120 --> 03:46:29,359
which is kind of a full stack ranging

5988
03:46:29,359 --> 03:46:31,840
from the ways that models are trained

5989
03:46:31,840 --> 03:46:34,560
based upon pragmatic value and reward

5990
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,960
all the way up through a world that

5991
03:46:36,960 --> 03:46:39,279
values economic returns

5992
03:46:39,279 --> 03:46:41,840
the question becomes in human robot

5993
03:46:41,840 --> 03:46:43,760
alignment or in multi-agent alignment

5994
03:46:43,760 --> 03:46:45,840
more generally the question becomes how

5995
03:46:45,840 --> 03:46:47,760
are we creating

5996
03:46:47,760 --> 03:46:50,800
and then allocating epistemic i'm sorry

5997
03:46:50,800 --> 03:46:52,800
how are we creating and then allocating

5998
03:46:52,800 --> 03:46:55,040
pragmatic value and epistem can be

5999
03:46:55,040 --> 03:46:57,279
valued to the extent that through time

6000
03:46:57,279 --> 03:46:59,840
it provides pragmatic value for example

6001
03:46:59,840 --> 03:47:01,359
one person doing a little bit more of a

6002
03:47:01,359 --> 03:47:03,199
research angle and one doing more of an

6003
03:47:03,199 --> 03:47:04,960
application and profit side of the

6004
03:47:04,960 --> 03:47:06,399
business

6005
03:47:06,399 --> 03:47:08,640
and when we shift

6006
03:47:08,640 --> 03:47:12,160
to a uncertainty imperative

6007
03:47:12,160 --> 03:47:14,399
for a sustainable or even optimistic

6008
03:47:14,399 --> 03:47:15,760
world model

6009
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:18,800
then we can achieve pragmatic value

6010
03:47:18,800 --> 03:47:20,880
as a consequence of a process theory

6011
03:47:20,880 --> 03:47:23,279
that highlights reduction of uncertainty

6012
03:47:23,279 --> 03:47:24,720
and then the question moves from

6013
03:47:24,720 --> 03:47:26,960
creating and allocating value

6014
03:47:26,960 --> 03:47:28,000
to

6015
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:31,439
how can this ecosystem of diverse

6016
03:47:31,439 --> 03:47:32,960
entities

6017
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:35,920
find a general synchrony and communicate

6018
03:47:35,920 --> 03:47:36,640
and

6019
03:47:36,640 --> 03:47:38,560
be how they are

6020
03:47:38,560 --> 03:47:41,359
in a way that will be

6021
03:47:41,359 --> 03:47:43,760
reducing the expected free energy of the

6022
03:47:43,760 --> 03:47:45,040
ensemble

6023
03:47:45,040 --> 03:47:47,279
which is not the question that was even

6024
03:47:47,279 --> 03:47:49,600
approached by the

6025
03:47:49,600 --> 03:47:53,600
create value allocate value framing

6026
03:47:53,600 --> 03:47:56,080
that has come up in ai and continues to

6027
03:47:56,080 --> 03:47:57,680
occur to this day

6028
03:47:57,680 --> 03:48:00,160
what if the image creators what if they

6029
03:48:00,160 --> 03:48:02,399
end up reducing our food allocation so

6030
03:48:02,399 --> 03:48:03,760
they can have more they take the

6031
03:48:03,760 --> 03:48:05,199
intellectual property instead of

6032
03:48:05,199 --> 03:48:08,080
providing it to humans

6033
03:48:08,080 --> 03:48:09,279
that might be framed slightly

6034
03:48:09,279 --> 03:48:11,600
differently in an uncertainty reduction

6035
03:48:11,600 --> 03:48:13,279
framework plus

6036
03:48:13,279 --> 03:48:14,800
optimism

6037
03:48:14,800 --> 03:48:18,960
rather than in a reward maximization

6038
03:48:18,960 --> 03:48:22,800
which somewhat enforces a atomism and

6039
03:48:22,800 --> 03:48:26,119
even a pessimism

6040
03:48:32,640 --> 03:48:34,479
that was an excellent point yeah

6041
03:48:34,479 --> 03:48:36,399
yeah

6042
03:48:36,399 --> 03:48:38,160
there are so many ways you can tackle

6043
03:48:38,160 --> 03:48:40,479
that and i'm still puzzling over adam's

6044
03:48:40,479 --> 03:48:42,560
charge how do you stop robots standing

6045
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:43,920
on your foot

6046
03:48:43,920 --> 03:48:45,840
i was thinking how do you stop little

6047
03:48:45,840 --> 03:48:49,040
puppy dogs wing on the carpet um you

6048
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:50,960
know i i think it's really going to

6049
03:48:50,960 --> 03:48:52,319
train them haven't you really i don't

6050
03:48:52,319 --> 03:48:55,199
think there's any magic answer

6051
03:48:55,199 --> 03:48:57,120
i think the answer is just what daniel

6052
03:48:57,120 --> 03:49:00,800
said you know uh things are designed and

6053
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:03,439
um can presumably only exist under the

6054
03:49:03,439 --> 03:49:05,040
free energy principle

6055
03:49:05,040 --> 03:49:08,399
um if they um minimize their uncertainty

6056
03:49:08,399 --> 03:49:10,319
or expected surprise so that they make

6057
03:49:10,319 --> 03:49:11,840
everything as predictable as possible

6058
03:49:11,840 --> 03:49:13,520
which simply means that if i'm living in

6059
03:49:13,520 --> 03:49:16,720
a world full of dogs robots cats flies

6060
03:49:16,720 --> 03:49:19,359
and plants um then we're all trying to

6061
03:49:19,359 --> 03:49:21,040
make ourselves as predictable as

6062
03:49:21,040 --> 03:49:22,880
possible to each other

6063
03:49:22,880 --> 03:49:25,199
and that is the you know that's a sort

6064
03:49:25,199 --> 03:49:27,920
of folk psychological way of saying that

6065
03:49:27,920 --> 03:49:29,199
um

6066
03:49:29,199 --> 03:49:30,960
variation free energy is an extensive

6067
03:49:30,960 --> 03:49:35,040
quantity so if a set of um markov

6068
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:38,000
blankets or phenotypes of varying forms

6069
03:49:38,000 --> 03:49:39,600
and structures

6070
03:49:39,600 --> 03:49:41,040
jointly

6071
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:43,359
has its own markov blanket so it is an

6072
03:49:43,359 --> 03:49:45,520
ensemble or a group or a community or a

6073
03:49:45,520 --> 03:49:49,040
family um then it must put an upper

6074
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:52,479
bound on its surprise and free energy

6075
03:49:52,479 --> 03:49:54,960
and because the free energy of each

6076
03:49:54,960 --> 03:49:58,720
constituent of that ensemble

6077
03:49:58,720 --> 03:49:59,920
is

6078
03:49:59,920 --> 03:50:02,960
summed to give the joint free energy

6079
03:50:02,960 --> 03:50:04,239
then it also

6080
03:50:04,239 --> 03:50:05,920
requires that each individual is trying

6081
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:08,399
to minimize her surprise at the same

6082
03:50:08,399 --> 03:50:10,960
time it's all internally consistent and

6083
03:50:10,960 --> 03:50:14,479
quite you know to my mind unmagical um

6084
03:50:14,479 --> 03:50:15,680
if you just look at it in terms of

6085
03:50:15,680 --> 03:50:17,920
minimizing free energy or minimizing

6086
03:50:17,920 --> 03:50:20,080
optim surprise under optimism was

6087
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:23,120
telling all that supported

6088
03:50:23,920 --> 03:50:24,880
thanks

6089
03:50:24,880 --> 03:50:26,560
you'd have to make your dog surprised

6090
03:50:26,560 --> 03:50:28,640
when he wheeze so you've got to find a

6091
03:50:28,640 --> 03:50:30,399
way of making the robot surprised when

6092
03:50:30,399 --> 03:50:32,840
it stands it stands on your on your

6093
03:50:32,840 --> 03:50:35,680
foot jf you have a

6094
03:50:35,680 --> 03:50:36,720
dog

6095
03:50:36,720 --> 03:50:38,720
right so how do you see similarities and

6096
03:50:38,720 --> 03:50:40,960
differences with these versions

6097
03:50:40,960 --> 03:50:44,640
of and also potentially even a family so

6098
03:50:44,640 --> 03:50:47,199
how do you see these different entities

6099
03:50:47,199 --> 03:50:49,040
being um

6100
03:50:49,040 --> 03:50:51,040
communicating and and behaving

6101
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:54,640
appropriately or not and learning

6102
03:50:54,640 --> 03:50:56,000
well that's

6103
03:50:56,000 --> 03:50:59,040
having a dog it raises the question of

6104
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:02,000
do i make myself understood

6105
03:51:02,000 --> 03:51:03,760
and that's a very that's a very

6106
03:51:03,760 --> 03:51:06,160
difficult question to answer when i say

6107
03:51:06,160 --> 03:51:07,840
no you're not allowed to eat from that

6108
03:51:07,840 --> 03:51:09,439
plate on the table

6109
03:51:09,439 --> 03:51:11,359
i think my dog understands i'm not

6110
03:51:11,359 --> 03:51:13,680
allowed to do this now

6111
03:51:13,680 --> 03:51:17,520
as soon as i walk out then permission is

6112
03:51:17,520 --> 03:51:18,720
granted

6113
03:51:18,720 --> 03:51:20,160
so i

6114
03:51:20,160 --> 03:51:22,720
you know it's it's difficult to

6115
03:51:22,720 --> 03:51:25,680
communication is very difficult across

6116
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:27,760
across individuals especially across the

6117
03:51:27,760 --> 03:51:29,120
species

6118
03:51:29,120 --> 03:51:32,160
but i'd like to to just

6119
03:51:32,160 --> 03:51:33,760
just rant a little bit on something

6120
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:35,040
which

6121
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:37,120
came up which is uh the scale-free

6122
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:39,760
nature of free energy principle the fact

6123
03:51:39,760 --> 03:51:42,399
that it can apply at a societal level

6124
03:51:42,399 --> 03:51:44,640
the same way that it applies like a

6125
03:51:44,640 --> 03:51:46,160
russian doll

6126
03:51:46,160 --> 03:51:48,880
to the cellular level

6127
03:51:48,880 --> 03:51:50,880
as a software developer

6128
03:51:50,880 --> 03:51:53,199
i see self-similarity

6129
03:51:53,199 --> 03:51:55,120
the recursion

6130
03:51:55,120 --> 03:51:58,800
fractal as as a as a beautiful thing and

6131
03:51:58,800 --> 03:52:00,560
i think at the

6132
03:52:00,560 --> 03:52:03,279
same way physicists have symmetries

6133
03:52:03,279 --> 03:52:06,880
as as a guide to what is

6134
03:52:06,880 --> 03:52:09,199
right because it's beautiful

6135
03:52:09,199 --> 03:52:11,600
i think we share

6136
03:52:11,600 --> 03:52:14,000
um self-similarity

6137
03:52:14,000 --> 03:52:17,199
as as a guide as what is beautiful and

6138
03:52:17,199 --> 03:52:18,399
possibly

6139
03:52:18,399 --> 03:52:21,359
true and i think self-similarity

6140
03:52:21,359 --> 03:52:23,840
is beautiful because it's it's it

6141
03:52:23,840 --> 03:52:25,359
it's

6142
03:52:25,359 --> 03:52:28,239
it's collapses the amount of information

6143
03:52:28,239 --> 03:52:32,800
that you need to generate something rich

6144
03:52:32,800 --> 03:52:36,080
um so that's why i think that having

6145
03:52:36,080 --> 03:52:38,960
a society of mind made up of actors and

6146
03:52:38,960 --> 03:52:41,199
having a society of minds

6147
03:52:41,199 --> 03:52:44,319
uh and having the same principles scale

6148
03:52:44,319 --> 03:52:46,080
up uh

6149
03:52:46,080 --> 03:52:48,239
feels very beautiful and

6150
03:52:48,239 --> 03:52:51,039
feels right

6151
03:52:52,840 --> 03:52:54,399
excellent

6152
03:52:54,399 --> 03:52:57,600
um yes just if we could go for any any

6153
03:52:57,600 --> 03:53:00,399
length of time a final set of thoughts

6154
03:53:00,399 --> 03:53:02,479
and reflections from each of you

6155
03:53:02,479 --> 03:53:04,160
quick interjection uh jf if you have

6156
03:53:04,160 --> 03:53:06,080
anything written on that or want to

6157
03:53:06,080 --> 03:53:08,560
write it there's an upcoming special

6158
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:11,120
issue on symmetries that

6159
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:14,319
i think it might fit with

6160
03:53:15,120 --> 03:53:16,560
would you like to

6161
03:53:16,560 --> 03:53:19,680
give any final reflections or anything

6162
03:53:19,680 --> 03:53:20,960
that you've heard

6163
03:53:20,960 --> 03:53:23,120
or felt updated by

6164
03:53:23,120 --> 03:53:25,040
any thoughts you have on

6165
03:53:25,040 --> 03:53:26,640
the state of the applied active

6166
03:53:26,640 --> 03:53:27,760
inference

6167
03:53:27,760 --> 03:53:30,640
in 2022 in robotics or where we're

6168
03:53:30,640 --> 03:53:32,720
heading now that this symposium is

6169
03:53:32,720 --> 03:53:36,039
behind us

6170
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:38,640
i'll start with adam but then everyone

6171
03:53:38,640 --> 03:53:41,198
else can go

6172
03:53:41,680 --> 03:53:43,439
um

6173
03:53:43,439 --> 03:53:44,720
thank you daniel

6174
03:53:44,720 --> 03:53:47,720
um

6175
03:53:52,479 --> 03:53:54,239
well this simulated a lot of questions

6176
03:53:54,239 --> 03:53:56,080
and just seeing the range of work being

6177
03:53:56,080 --> 03:53:59,600
done was inspiring and um all i have to

6178
03:53:59,600 --> 03:54:01,040
say is i was grateful to be a part of

6179
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:02,319
this

6180
03:54:02,319 --> 03:54:05,680
thank you for putting this together

6181
03:54:05,680 --> 03:54:08,080
thank you adam and

6182
03:54:08,080 --> 03:54:10,560
after the closing words i'll review

6183
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:11,840
every presentation and list the

6184
03:54:11,840 --> 03:54:14,080
co-organizers as well so bruno and then

6185
03:54:14,080 --> 03:54:15,279
we'll continue on

6186
03:54:15,279 --> 03:54:17,520
yeah just just like adam said thanks a

6187
03:54:17,520 --> 03:54:19,680
lot for the invitation it was it was

6188
03:54:19,680 --> 03:54:22,560
very kind of you i think i want to thank

6189
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:24,800
mark for insisting mark miller that was

6190
03:54:24,800 --> 03:54:26,880
insisting on us

6191
03:54:26,880 --> 03:54:29,680
to present with you here um it was it

6192
03:54:29,680 --> 03:54:33,199
was a very nice experience and

6193
03:54:33,199 --> 03:54:35,359
well we keep we we keep working we need

6194
03:54:35,359 --> 03:54:36,880
more hands

6195
03:54:36,880 --> 03:54:38,640
we have more ideas than hands but i

6196
03:54:38,640 --> 03:54:41,600
suppose that's everyone's problem no so

6197
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:45,720
yeah thanks a lot

6198
03:54:47,600 --> 03:54:48,960
great

6199
03:54:48,960 --> 03:54:50,610
then there were three

6200
03:54:50,610 --> 03:54:52,960
[Music]

6201
03:54:52,960 --> 03:54:55,358
uh-huh

6202
03:54:55,520 --> 03:54:56,800
jf

6203
03:54:56,800 --> 03:54:59,359
yes well again thank you very much this

6204
03:54:59,359 --> 03:55:01,439
was extremely stimulating

6205
03:55:01,439 --> 03:55:05,040
every talk i came up i came out

6206
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:06,399
listening to it with

6207
03:55:06,399 --> 03:55:09,760
this i want to introduce in my robots

6208
03:55:09,760 --> 03:55:13,439
some aspect of it uh and my mind is is

6209
03:55:13,439 --> 03:55:15,279
buzzing right now with with

6210
03:55:15,279 --> 03:55:17,920
possibilities and so thank you so much

6211
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:21,199
for this opportunity

6212
03:55:27,600 --> 03:55:29,120
i guess uh

6213
03:55:29,120 --> 03:55:31,359
i can go next also

6214
03:55:31,359 --> 03:55:33,600
thanks a lot for uh

6215
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:35,680
um being able to

6216
03:55:35,680 --> 03:55:38,399
join this this final round table and for

6217
03:55:38,399 --> 03:55:39,760
all of the

6218
03:55:39,760 --> 03:55:41,359
great presentations i'll definitely have

6219
03:55:41,359 --> 03:55:42,399
to

6220
03:55:42,399 --> 03:55:44,080
look over them

6221
03:55:44,080 --> 03:55:44,960
uh

6222
03:55:44,960 --> 03:55:47,439
probably a couple couple more times uh

6223
03:55:47,439 --> 03:55:49,439
to fully

6224
03:55:49,439 --> 03:55:52,640
uh understand all the

6225
03:55:52,640 --> 03:55:54,399
progress that um

6226
03:55:54,399 --> 03:55:57,600
has been has been made and specific

6227
03:55:57,600 --> 03:55:59,920
specifically on there's a lot of a lot

6228
03:55:59,920 --> 03:56:01,359
to consider on

6229
03:56:01,359 --> 03:56:04,479
the multi-agent uh modeling and

6230
03:56:04,479 --> 03:56:07,199
the ideas uh in this discussion that

6231
03:56:07,199 --> 03:56:09,040
uh

6232
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:11,600
we were also talking about quite a lot

6233
03:56:11,600 --> 03:56:15,680
in the active block friends uh project

6234
03:56:15,680 --> 03:56:17,680
um

6235
03:56:17,680 --> 03:56:19,920
probably was left with uh

6236
03:56:19,920 --> 03:56:22,239
more more questions at the at the end of

6237
03:56:22,239 --> 03:56:24,880
it but that's also the exciting part of

6238
03:56:24,880 --> 03:56:26,000
it so

6239
03:56:26,000 --> 03:56:28,880
thanks a lot

6240
03:56:29,840 --> 03:56:32,239
and now it's my turn i cleverly leave

6241
03:56:32,239 --> 03:56:34,000
myself to last because everything that

6242
03:56:34,000 --> 03:56:35,680
needs to be said has already been said

6243
03:56:35,680 --> 03:56:37,600
so that just means

6244
03:56:37,600 --> 03:56:40,479
all i have to do is just to thank daniel

6245
03:56:40,479 --> 03:56:42,080
and his colleagues which he's going to

6246
03:56:42,080 --> 03:56:44,239
thank anyway but personally to daniel

6247
03:56:44,239 --> 03:56:46,640
thanks so much for all your energy not

6248
03:56:46,640 --> 03:56:49,040
just today but over the years it is

6249
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:50,960
really great to see these people

6250
03:56:50,960 --> 03:56:53,040
and coys come together and sort of you

6251
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:55,439
know generate ideas and questions which

6252
03:56:55,439 --> 03:56:57,760
is exactly what we need to do

6253
03:56:57,760 --> 03:56:59,199
thank you

6254
03:56:59,199 --> 03:57:02,000
thanks a lot carl and i think by one

6255
03:57:02,000 --> 03:57:04,319
personal reflection

6256
03:57:04,319 --> 03:57:07,439
it swooped in at the end when jf said

6257
03:57:07,439 --> 03:57:09,359
that at

6258
03:57:09,359 --> 03:57:11,120
from each of the presentations there was

6259
03:57:11,120 --> 03:57:13,199
like a module or an archetype or a

6260
03:57:13,199 --> 03:57:16,239
function that transposed and i think

6261
03:57:16,239 --> 03:57:19,600
that is proof of concept of working in a

6262
03:57:19,600 --> 03:57:22,160
shared ontology as well as in an

6263
03:57:22,160 --> 03:57:23,920
embodied

6264
03:57:23,920 --> 03:57:25,840
shared ontology which is to say like a

6265
03:57:25,840 --> 03:57:28,399
field in a community of practice

6266
03:57:28,399 --> 03:57:30,239
with different small world structures

6267
03:57:30,239 --> 03:57:33,120
and so on but when we have the ability

6268
03:57:33,120 --> 03:57:36,239
to transpose across systems and scales

6269
03:57:36,239 --> 03:57:38,080
then we can bring in

6270
03:57:38,080 --> 03:57:40,479
the modules and the pieces that people

6271
03:57:40,479 --> 03:57:42,000
are mentioning

6272
03:57:42,000 --> 03:57:44,080
and start to understand how those

6273
03:57:44,080 --> 03:57:46,479
functions can be composed and designed

6274
03:57:46,479 --> 03:57:50,239
and that's extremely exciting

6275
03:57:50,720 --> 03:57:52,560
everyone thanks for joining the round

6276
03:57:52,560 --> 03:57:54,720
table you can depart the zoom or i'm

6277
03:57:54,720 --> 03:57:58,239
just going to review the uh presenters

6278
03:57:58,239 --> 03:58:00,640
again and the co-organizers so thank you

6279
03:58:00,640 --> 03:58:02,319
