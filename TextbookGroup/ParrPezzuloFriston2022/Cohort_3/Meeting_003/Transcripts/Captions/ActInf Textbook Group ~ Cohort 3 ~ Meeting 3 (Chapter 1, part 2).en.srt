1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,299
hello it's February 8th 2023 we're in

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,919
cohort three

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,260
and we're having our second discussion

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,540
on chapter one

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,340
so just a few

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,520
side notes before we jump to the

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,900
questions

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,320
uh first I'll place this in the chat

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,699
but

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,960
we can

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,720
um hey Maria are you recording the the

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,060
meeting yes I'm recording it with OBS

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,940
like on my local computer okay I'm sorry

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,739
oh no thank you for checking the icon

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,660
okay thanks for checking yes it doesn't

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,719
mention it it's like a yes

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,760
so last week we talked about neats and

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,079
scruffies

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,660
and those terms are due to Raj or shank

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
and it was actually last week that Roger

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,700
shank had passed away which I have just

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,199
placed in the chat

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,000
so

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
auspicious though tragic

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,460
and people may

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,760
find a lot of in this article by Harold

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,780
jarch

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,000
a lot of interesting

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,020
um

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,720
thoughts on learning by doing

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,580
teaching others to do this is the next

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,100
step in the education Revolution

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,860
and also there's a student's Bill of

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,000
Rights

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,479
that I had never seen from shank before

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,659
so there's a lot of interesting

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,979
um

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,479
pieces here

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,479
so for those who are interested

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,840
take a look and maybe see how we can

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,700
bring some of that

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,159
back to the textbook group

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,439
and then also awesome thanks

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
yeah

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,600
and then um I don't see Yana Here but

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,820
yesterday Jana and I

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,159
went to the step-by-step active

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,020
inference paper which I'll also put in

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,520
the chat is one that we reference all

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,479
the time

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,880
because it has a step-by-step building

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,220
of like static perception Dynamic

53
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,899
perception these are passive

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,299
interference and then action comes into

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,380
play

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,419
and we

57
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,580
use the ontology

58
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,580
to describe what was happening and use

59
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,440
latex in coda to write the equation

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,140
and then uh

61
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,239
made some tables

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,520
that allowed us to flip between

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
different ways of talking about what was

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
given and what we're calculating

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,300
wrote the pseudo code

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,879
made tables for every variable and

67
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,860
interpreted every column

68
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,680
so this was just for the static example

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,540
but it was a lot of fun

70
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,400
and I'll also put that

71
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,019
thanks Jonathan that's that sounds cool

72
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,599
too yeah so this was a lot of fun that

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,560
we had

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,860
and just uh there's definitely some

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,680
walls that we run up against like doing

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,620
vector and matrix multiplication in Coda

77
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,680
but it's a fun direction for making

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,860
really interactive and multimedia

79
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,360
um

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,400
systems all right so

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,140
let's go to chapter one

82
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,900
does anyone want to give any thought or

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,819
comment at all on chapter one

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
any thought or or

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,540
question at all

86
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,840
and then we'll jump into the questions

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,180
that the cohort has had on chapter one

88
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,659
it feels like a long while now since

89
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,280
reading it could have been last week

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,299
could have been last year

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,819
yeah feel free to raise your hand or

92
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,640
write in the chat

93
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,220
any comment or question that's

94
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,860
presenting itself to you today

95
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,000
or we will look into

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,920
the questions that

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,119
the cohort wrote

98
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,020
okay

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,340
it looks like we may have done this last

100
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,139
time

101
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,600
what is the relationship between policy

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,639
and environment maybe anyone can just

103
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,780
give a

104
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,780
summary or thought on that and then

105
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,679
we'll move it up

106
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,139
okay

107
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,360
yeah very informative comment thread

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,860
Brock go for it and then anyone else

109
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,740
um policies are

110
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,820
um selections on affordances

111
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,080
in uh like late in the foreign

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
environment

113
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,880
speak thanks yeah

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,160
and then let's look at the comment

115
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,520
thread

116
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,340
generative process stomach is empty

117
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,919
stomach emits a rumble that's a great

118
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,940
example

119
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,520
because the generative process

120
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
helps

121
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,940
frame it in terms of what it is which is

122
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,060
the process that passes observations to

123
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,460
the blanket this doesn't have to be

124
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,240
outside quote of the organism

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,580
so the true

126
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,340
status of the stomach

127
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,500
is an external state

128
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,460
with respect to the blanket States being

129
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,960
interception and the internal States

130
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,060
being

131
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,960
cognitive modeling of interception

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,699
generative process is just whatever

133
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,340
passes observations

134
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,160
so it doesn't have to be the niche

135
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,919
but in the case of exteroception

136
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,919
Vision hearing Etc

137
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,800
pockets coming into a server

138
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,000
then it is outside of the agents

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
but it doesn't have to be spatially

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,979
outside of the agents Jonathan

141
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,319
yeah we said that the generative process

142
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,259
is the thing that passes observations

143
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,020
um presumably it doesn't have to pass an

144
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,220
observation there can be things

145
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,860
happening in the outside world that we

146
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,020
don't have access to but may still be

147
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,319
part of our generative that what yeah

148
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,819
what is actually the generative process

149
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,099
of the real world

150
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,860
great point the generative process does

151
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,319
pass observations to the blanket

152
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,599
but that is not all it has to do

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
so it could have

154
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,020
um the extra the generative process

155
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,180
could have 10 variables

156
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,840
like the thunderstorm could have

157
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,380
temperature light sounds

158
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,500
but then we only have a microphone so

159
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,360
we're only perceiving sound

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,580
so the generative process is passing us

161
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,720
sounds

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,580
and then that is being used by the

163
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,599
agents

164
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,800
but that's not to say that the

165
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,340
generative process is only sound

166
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,520
and that comes back to to a

167
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,380
um

168
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,120
slightly more General point which is

169
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,919
that the state space of the generative

170
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,259
process doesn't have to be the same as

171
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,120
the state space of the cognitive model

172
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,940
foreign

173
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,539
foreign

174
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,300
processes can be other generative models

175
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,520
in the social setting as Jonathan is

176
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,620
pointing to that's sometimes called

177
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,839
thinking through other Minds

178
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,120
and let's look at this

179
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,479
it's cool when we can see a previous

180
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
question

181
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,320
on the notion of surprise is the agent's

182
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,480
perception not only affected by the

183
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,800
influence

184
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
of its environments but also an agent's

185
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
peers

186
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,399
so the agent's peers are updating their

187
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,000
beliefs in a collaborative fashion

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,680
what would be the extent of the update

189
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,279
to an agent's GM of perceptions if an

190
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,380
agent Witnesses the annihilation of one

191
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,360
of its peers for example something like

192
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
this

193
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,920
okay it's a wildebeest

194
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,360
people can check out the video

195
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,560
okay

196
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,040
Michael please

197
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,800
I I just have a question with respect

198
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,180
previously you wrote down that policy a

199
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,660
policy is a sequence of affordances and

200
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,300
I was wondering is it a sequence or is

201
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,519
it the one affordance

202
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,580
is it is a policy one affordance or is a

203
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,040
policy a sequence so is it can it be

204
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,560
more than one influence I was

205
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,839
of the understanding that the policy is

206
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,260
one affordance but maybe I'm confused

207
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,600
yeah good good

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,839
question and policy and affordance are

209
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,580
used slightly differently

210
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,440
for example in the reinforcement

211
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,480
learning setting but we won't

212
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,360
necessarily go there so if wardens are

213
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,160
the actions that can be taken in a

214
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,540
single moment

215
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,399
alternative actions that can be taken

216
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,100
so this could be movement up down left

217
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,580
right this could be an eye cicade up

218
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,860
down left right

219
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,660
policy is going to be a sequence of

220
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,260
those for a given time Horizon

221
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,320
so if the time Horizon is one

222
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,500
or the temporal depth of the model is

223
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,060
one

224
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,880
this is the same as affordances

225
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,660
but if the the temporal depth

226
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,060
were two

227
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,200
then it would be all combinations

228
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
of two affordances

229
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,279
so up up up down down left right right

230
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
left

231
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,980
how does it then work with

232
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,100
epistemic and pragmatic affordances at

233
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,839
some points in the book it says that

234
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,380
these are two aspects of one affordance

235
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,839
mm-hmm

236
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,920
yes great we we are going to get there

237
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,300
and here's what it's going to look like

238
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,260
and just to peek forward in chapter two

239
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,060
so

240
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,180
um Pi our policy

241
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,459
Pi for policy

242
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,640
G is expected free energy

243
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,339
expected free energy is going to be

244
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,240
calculated for every single policy

245
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,640
so again if that is temporal depth of

246
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,279
one it's just equivalent to the options

247
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,500
that can be taken in that moment

248
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,440
if this is a temporal depth of five then

249
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
it's the free energy expected free

250
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,500
energy of

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,040
up up up up up up up up up up up up down

252
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,279
now those different policies

253
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,279
are going to be evaluated according to

254
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,560
this single imperative expected free

255
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,859
energy

256
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,680
that's going to rank different policies

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,560
based upon their posterior likelihood

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,140
in reward slash reinforcement learning

259
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,240
you would rank policies by their

260
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,000
expected reward

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,019
in fep we're going to rank policies by

262
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,240
their expected free energy which is

263
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
going to describe their posterior

264
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,440
likelihood

265
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,380
different policies might be seen as

266
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,700
likely

267
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,920
for different reasons

268
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,320
and this equation can be partitioned in

269
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,720
different ways to understand that so a

270
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,579
policy might be seen as really good

271
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,800
let's just say it's good but that means

272
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,060
the same thing as saying it's a likely

273
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,920
policy

274
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,380
if it secures a lot of Information Gain

275
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
on the other hand a policy could be seen

276
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,000
as good or likely if it secures a lot of

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,779
pragmatic value

278
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,339
those both get projected down into the

279
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,600
expected free energy now

280
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
conversationally

281
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,380
people will say something like oh well

282
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,700
opening the book that's like an

283
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,980
epistemic affordance

284
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,440
that's compatible with what we're

285
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
talking about here

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,360
but the partition here would be like the

287
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,420
affordance is to open the book or not

288
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,040
open the book

289
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,940
and then the action selection to open

290
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,959
the book

291
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,660
is selected because it has a high

292
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,820
Information Gain

293
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,399
so the idea and one that we'll continue

294
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,760
to revisit is that you can get Behavior

295
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,600
that's able to exhibit

296
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,200
pragmatic values seeking components and

297
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,860
when those are unclear on how to pursue

298
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,820
come into an information seeking mode

299
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,800
through a unified imperative G

300
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,839
so we still do have epistemic epistemic

301
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,060
affordances in the conversational sense

302
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,820
but to be strict about it there are just

303
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,399
affordances which are the capacities for

304
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,480
action

305
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,240
and then different policies are selected

306
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
or not and we can partition that

307
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,620
differently and that partitioning May

308
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,420
reveal that a policy was selected

309
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,120
because it reduced information

310
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,220
had high epistemic value

311
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,260
reduced informational uncertainty should

312
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,040
I say

313
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,220
um or it was aligning observations with

314
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,800
preferences which is pragmatic value

315
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,040
foreign

316
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,440
can we relate policy with Goal I'm going

317
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,660
to just copy in these answers

318
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,519
page 101

319
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,800
chapter five well we'll come there

320
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,860
okay

321
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,180
any other

322
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,060
comments or questions on this topic

323
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,420
okay

324
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,500
Ali

325
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,060
uh actually about about Maria's question

326
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,600
uh that if we can relate policy uh with

327
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
goals

328
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,380
um well

329
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,500
maybe I don't know I if I can reiterate

330
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,680
that example I pointed out in the last

331
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,639
session about picking up uh a couple a

332
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,920
cop so yeah actually uh the the goal is

333
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,040
somehow

334
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,279
inherently Consolidated into our actions

335
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,120
and our policies uh or at least at our

336
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,899
goal directive actions uh so I pointed

337
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,639
out to an example

338
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,240
um

339
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,060
from

340
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,699
ritzalatian senegalia's book mirrors in

341
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,820
the brain which says that picking up a

342
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,220
cup of coffee can be done in various

343
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,620
ways depending on whether we are

344
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,139
drinking from it uh in which in that

345
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,899
case we would grasp it by the handle or

346
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,839
if we're washing it in that case we'll

347
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,000
grasp it by the rim or moving it out of

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,299
the way uh in that case we would grasp

349
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,400
it by the body so yeah actually in this

350
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,760
scenario selecting the appropriate

351
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,040
policy would necessarily require

352
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,020
considering the goal of that policy or

353
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,220
action

354
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,299
yes thank you and

355
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,880
we can talk about goals

356
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,220
but the way that it plays out in the

357
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,740
generative model there isn't a variable

358
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,840
that's called the goal

359
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,640
so here

360
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
um Jonathan wrote the goal is really

361
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
about minimizing expected free energy so

362
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,700
yes some kind of meta imperative is

363
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,280
to fulfill the minimization of free

364
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,120
energy

365
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
but let's think about like the goal is

366
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,679
to move uh the goal is to move the

367
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,140
coffee cup to the drying rack

368
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,620
that is actually going to be embedded in

369
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,000
the preference

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,280
we expect and prefer to see the cup on

371
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
the drying rack

372
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,059
oh I observed it in the sink I'm

373
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,200
surprised

374
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,120
maybe even anxious

375
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,160
what are the affordances

376
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
well

377
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,160
without going too deep into a motor

378
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,539
model

379
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,539
we could like grab or not grab move arm

380
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,400
left move arm right

381
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,840
and then some policy like move arm left

382
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,640
grab move arm right release the grab

383
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,700
that's a four-step policy

384
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,340
that has pragmatic value

385
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,140
again looking forward but we're going to

386
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,660
come to this in the coming weeks

387
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,460
that policy

388
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,039
has value and it's like a goal-oriented

389
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,980
policy because we reduce the Divergence

390
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,760
between our preferences and observations

391
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,539
so goal oriented or pragmatic Behavior

392
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,240
is loaded heavily in this pragmatic

393
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,740
value section

394
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,480
which at its heart has to do with the

395
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,120
um relationship between

396
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,620
preferences

397
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,320
and observations

398
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,760
that's why we talk about like expect

399
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,380
slash prefer

400
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,520
like

401
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
we talk about it as a preference

402
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,740
but the way that it plays out is again

403
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,020
not by preferred states are the most

404
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,080
rewarding but preferred states are the

405
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,700
most expected

406
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,580
you'll be least surprised when your body

407
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,980
temperature is in its preferred value

408
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,720
when your body temperature is out of

409
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,260
your preferences you'll be surprised how

410
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,480
are we going to bound that surprise free

411
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,500
energy

412
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,740
just as it's done in Bayesian statistics

413
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
how are you going to bound surprise

414
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,120
there's two ways you could change the

415
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,220
world or you could change your mind

416
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,840
changing your mind

417
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,240
depending on the time scale is like

418
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,280
perception or learning

419
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,140
changing the world happens through

420
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,280
action

421
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,400
so let's just say we're again surprised

422
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,080
at seeing the coffee cup

423
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,820
in the sink

424
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,700
changing our mind might look like

425
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,340
updating our model of where we expect to

426
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,720
see coffee cups so that we're not

427
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,980
surprised

428
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,919
oh it's normal that it's in the sink

429
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,440
so now I'm not surprised anymore so we

430
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,220
effectively reduce Surprise by learning

431
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,520
or you could reduce your

432
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,580
expected free energy by taking sequences

433
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,120
of action

434
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,919
and whether a generative model

435
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
learns or how it learns or or whether it

436
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,679
acts and how it acts that has to do with

437
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,720
the details of how the model are set up

438
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,340
why exploration and exploitation are

439
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,200
automatically balanced through policy

440
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,299
selection and active inference what does

441
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,580
it mean to say both are balanced

442
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,140
any

443
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,460
thought

444
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,840
or related idea here

445
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,399
Jonathan and anyone else

446
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,720
yeah I mean I think it's to to really

447
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,340
understand it you have to understand the

448
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,799
equation that you were just showing us

449
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,280
um where the information game is about

450
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,140
exploration we can think about about

451
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,240
exploration and the pragmatic is about

452
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,220
exploitation

453
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,600
um and so to really understand how

454
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,159
that's automatically balanced you have

455
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,360
to understand exactly where that

456
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,880
equation comes from I think

457
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,020
awesome totally agree yes it's captured

458
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,520
in

459
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,179
expected free energy calculation

460
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,960
so this equation is not necessarily the

461
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,360
solution it's not a strategy to

462
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,480
balancing explore exploit like depending

463
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,640
on what variables are set

464
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,940
you could result in a agent that

465
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,860
always goes for the right slot machine

466
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,159
or always takes the hint so it's not

467
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,159
that just by Framing it this way

468
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,120
the problem has been solved but this as

469
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,720
it turns out creates an incredible

470
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,700
flexible framework for fitting

471
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,919
parameters and testing different models

472
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,919
that include the wide diversity of

473
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,220
cognitive phenomena like attention and

474
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,799
all of these other complex phenomena so

475
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,520
it's like linear regression y equals MX

476
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,780
plus b

477
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,240
that's not a solution to the regression

478
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,480
it's the space in which lines are going

479
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,299
to be compared to each other

480
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,419
so expected free energy isn't the

481
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,059
solution to Adaptive policy

482
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,520
but it's a space in which policies can

483
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,559
be compared with each other how are they

484
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,900
going to be compared with each other

485
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,000
with expected free energy

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,179
what are some decompositions of expected

487
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,320
free energy

488
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,600
it turns out to have some very useful

489
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,400
decompositions

490
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,440
that connect us with

491
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,020
on one hand in the top line

492
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,760
the semantics

493
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,980
of value

494
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,440
broadly in terms of informational or

495
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,500
epistemic value and pragmatic or utility

496
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,640
value

497
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,580
so that's one huge connection because we

498
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,980
can think about special cases like if

499
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,320
there's no information to be gained

500
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,380
expected free energy is going to get

501
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,020
only pragmatic value

502
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,539
if there's no pragmatic value

503
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,360
then it is equivalent to a pure

504
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,240
information novelty approach

505
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,640
and it can do mixes

506
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,400
but there's other decompositions that

507
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,340
connect to the middle lines here

508
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,320
have to do with

509
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,080
um decision and control theory and then

510
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,640
this bottom line

511
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,860
points the way towards connections with

512
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,059
physics

513
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,120
where we see energy and entropy for

514
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,700
example in the Gibbs free energy

515
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,520
so that's kind of a doorway into physics

516
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,620
and thermodynamics

517
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,900
and it's this

518
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,220
these are all just different

519
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,880
decompositions of the same functional

520
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,880
foreign

521
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,799
it's a an advocate's

522
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,000
claim

523
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,539
that active inference simply balances

524
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,039
explore exploit

525
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,000
but a slightly more measured angle would

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,780
be

527
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,419
it frames the problem so that generative

528
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,340
models can be constructed and

529
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,720
parameterized

530
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,240
that are able to adaptively navigate

531
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,620
explore and exploit

532
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,559
any

533
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,279
preference for a question to go to next

534
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,080
or anyone please feel free to just raise

535
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,240
any questions coming to mind Michael and

536
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,799
then anyone else

537
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,320
yeah I was wondering this distinction

538
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,500
between exploration exploitation does it

539
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,980
only apply to the expected values or

540
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,779
also to the variational free energy

541
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,720
good question

542
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,159
um

543
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,279
we will come to explore the similarities

544
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,140
and differences between

545
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,700
variational free energy figure 2.5 F and

546
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,580
expected free energy G

547
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,620
equation 2.6

548
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,240
in short

549
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,419
variational free energy f

550
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,159
is taking in as arguments Q are beliefs

551
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,260
the variational distributions that

552
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,080
represent our beliefs and data

553
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,380
so in variational free energy we're

554
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,960
actually not engaged in policy selection

555
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,720
in expected free energy we are engaged

556
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,299
in policy selection

557
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,600
so variational free energy is a common

558
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,640
measure used in

559
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,100
machine learning and statistics

560
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,580
because of its ability to effectively

561
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,419
fit models Based on data

562
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,240
and then to really take the full octave

563
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,200
turn

564
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,480
and talk about not just

565
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,539
optimal fitting of data but not

566
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,100
overfitting which is like what

567
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,500
variational free energy does

568
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,779
in the expected free energy case is when

569
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,779
we actually get into the consideration

570
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,640
of alternate affordances yeah Michael

571
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,480
then anyone else

572
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,880
yeah yeah so so you're you're saying

573
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,419
that exploration exploitation relates to

574
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,460
the policy so to the somehow to the

575
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,299
Future

576
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,559
right but I can also engage right now uh

577
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,860
right now into an exploration or an

578
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,299
exploitation isn't that the case

579
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,020
um so it I mean it does not only relate

580
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,760
to the future I guess does it

581
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,179
or

582
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,640
or what I'm I'm misunderstanding there

583
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,279
so I can explore

584
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,580
right now not only in in a plan for the

585
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,760
future

586
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,620
okay Jonathan

587
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,900
yeah I'd say that by some exploration

588
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,880
and exploitation are sort of active

589
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,580
things you know even if it's in the

590
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,200
moment now

591
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
um it's still uh you know it may be some

592
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
sequence it may be relatively short but

593
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,779
it's still something about what's

594
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,240
happening now and where I want to be

595
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,700
um so I I think that you know even if

596
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,679
you're thinking about your exploration

597
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,080
in this moment it is really about what's

598
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,120
happening in some some future time that

599
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,580
you're attempting to do

600
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,360
nice thank you and thanks great thank

601
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,640
you yeah and and also like exploration

602
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,940
exploitation are kind of informal

603
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,140
terms to describe different behavioral

604
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,059
outcomes

605
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,678
they're not necessarily like formal

606
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,159
um and then also uh a great comment

607
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,960
there in the chat

608
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,620
um

609
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,879
I'll just put it in here

610
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,980
this is a good reminder that like

611
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,380
affordances and policies it's like

612
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,580
always come back to map and territory

613
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,440
there's the affordances that the person

614
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,299
can engage in and that's like the

615
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,919
territory if you really want to think

616
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,779
about it and wonder about it like what

617
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,980
can a body do but as modeled there are

618
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,380
modeler degrees of freedom in which

619
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,080
affordances are going to be considered

620
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,120
for the agent to do

621
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,200
so

622
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,659
go to the vending machine like that

623
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,039
could be you could have the affordance

624
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,620
go to the vending machine or go or not

625
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,380
go it's just binary or you could have

626
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,020
raise your quadricep muscle

627
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,659
and flex your calf muscle

628
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,279
so that's going to be a model that can

629
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,960
do a lot of other things

630
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,399
but then you're going to have to have

631
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,620
all of this parameterization just to be

632
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,720
able to get out of the chair

633
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,539
so how you coarse grain

634
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,520
action

635
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,919
is one of the major

636
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,380
modeler degrees of freedom

637
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,020
and challenges in action modeling

638
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,940
we'll come back to this more times

639
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,820
any just offhand comment or question

640
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,658
that someone has

641
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,279
foreign

642
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,640
following the question mark is just a

643
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,720
tracking device

644
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,620
okay

645
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,960
it's a Twitter thread

646
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
we're reading books

647
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,760
why you want to go with a computational

648
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,700
approach why not just go full on Gibson

649
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,919
plus dynamical systems

650
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,399
well

651
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,080
this should be very

652
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,520
um

653
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,799
relevant I'll just bring in update here

654
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,480
actually Maxwell also had a response on

655
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,340
that tweet

656
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,860
okay let's let's start

657
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,340
what what

658
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,899
do you remember or what was the response

659
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,399
oh here responds to this oh yeah and

660
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,460
there's active inference wow

661
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,919
look at that foundational

662
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,659
Atlas Atlas Shrugged

663
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,240
do you remember what his response was

664
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,320
Ollie

665
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,460
uh yeah he somehow

666
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,840
um

667
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,600
well there's just the word uh was that

668
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,820
those two are not necessarily

669
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,640
exclusively mutual

670
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,980
and I mean I mean uh mutually exclusive

671
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,220
sorry but uh actually he's writing a

672
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,860
paper to show the relevance between the

673
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,520
two uh and uh yeah they're more

674
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,700
compatible than uh some people might

675
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,140
think so

676
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,720
uh

677
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,419
let me find the exact tweet thank you

678
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,640
yeah like

679
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,039
if it comes to conceptual

680
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,899
understanding

681
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,960
almost everything is compatible

682
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,320
it's like just how flexible are you

683
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,419
willing to be

684
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,500
but there are things that are

685
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,419
incompatible and then the question is

686
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,340
like kind of so what

687
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,860
or what is the bigger framework that

688
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,539
those are

689
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,760
or the context in which those are aren't

690
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
compatible

691
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,659
um excitingly though this will be

692
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,960
tomorrow

693
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,620
um

694
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,140
I'll put the paper in the chat this is

695
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,600
uh so Jay Benjamin Fallen days will join

696
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,399
for a guest stream

697
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,500
a potential mechanism for gibsonian

698
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,700
resonance

699
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,500
behavioral entrainment emerges from

700
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,539
local homeostasis in an unsupervised

701
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,100
Reservoir Network

702
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,220
so I hope to

703
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,059
um

704
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:25,620
see A Accessible presentation on

705
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,620
modern gibsonian

706
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,840
modeling

707
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,440
and drawing out some similarities and

708
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,799
differences that are real or perceived

709
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,360
with active inference

710
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,959
ever and then anyone else

711
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,779
this

712
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:51,120
gibsonian or computational approach

713
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,860
there's also

714
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,360
links to

715
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,080
um to the question is uh perception

716
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,480
inferential or is it is it more direct

717
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,519
perception

718
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,080
and I

719
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,200
don't really find a good argument that

720
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,659
discusses the evidence for for

721
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,260
inferential approach to perception or

722
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,320
ecological direct perception

723
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,859
so I was wondering which way to go

724
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,918
yes there's so many

725
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,980
um angles on this one of them is maps

726
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,619
not territories so whatever it is that

727
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,320
perception really is for ants or humans

728
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,540
or computers we're going to model it

729
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,418
with Bayesian inference so that's a very

730
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,780
strong position because then it leaves

731
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,199
the other person debating about how Maps

732
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,260
really are while we're over here using

733
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,119
modern computational tools to do

734
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,339
statistical modeling and inference so

735
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,980
that kind of sidesteps the discussion

736
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,320
about the ontology of what is actual

737
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,660
perception and puts it into the

738
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,580
instrumentalist camp

739
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,280
and then in terms of evidence the first

740
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,619
thing that comes to mind is

741
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,960
we're perceiving colors and shapes in

742
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,339
our blind spot

743
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,500
so no of course it's not direct

744
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,359
perception you don't have photoreceptors

745
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,160
there

746
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,599
is that

747
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,320
conclusive

748
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,720
so okay this is this is mainly if it's

749
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,180
fission visual perception is mainly uh

750
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:35,040
used as a as a way to discuss perception

751
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,740
but it gets more difficult if you talk

752
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,460
about about for example pay or olfactory

753
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,160
perception and then and then the

754
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,500
question is is all perception

755
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,140
inferential or are there is does it

756
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,880
depend on

757
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
the kind of perception you're talking

758
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,640
about is it visual or auditory

759
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,680
um

760
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,839
and I'm wondering

761
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,720
yeah it's it's um

762
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,780
there's definitely a lot of nuance once

763
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,200
we step outside of the clear invisible

764
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,740
visual setting or the tangible and

765
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,980
comprehensible tactile setting

766
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,339
those are very immediate

767
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:24,119
but analogy is certainly apply to other

768
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,940
sensory modalities and again whatever

769
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,859
the modality is

770
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,200
one can say we're using Bayesian

771
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,220
inference

772
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,839
so let's just say whatever direct

773
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,720
perception means

774
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,540
how is it being statistically modeled is

775
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,619
this

776
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,859
yeah so the direct perception the way I

777
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,780
understand the difference is that uh our

778
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,300
priors are determine uh uh

779
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,300
have a big influence and what we have uh

780
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,160
as a perception and in the direct

781
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,579
perception our priors don't influence

782
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,560
what we perceive

783
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,079
uh but maybe I need to

784
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,960
black and white here

785
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,200
lay it out and see if it's been argued

786
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,980
that way elsewhere or

787
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,200
what exactly would reduce your

788
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,240
uncertainty about that question and if

789
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,280
no one has laid it out so simply then it

790
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,200
will be making a contribution

791
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,480
Jonathan

792
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,520
yeah I I didn't have this this answers

793
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,880
the question at all but I think

794
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,280
your question there about the prize

795
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,359
um we it may be that we have

796
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,660
um very accurate incoming information

797
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,099
and therefore independent of what our

798
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,839
priority you open the door and you don't

799
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,760
know what's behind the door

800
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,800
um the the prize will still have some

801
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,599
effects but they may have much less

802
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,400
effect than in than the incoming

803
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,599
information

804
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,460
um so I I don't think it's a matter of

805
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,040
one uh sort of one form of perception

806
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,780
using priors and others not I think it's

807
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,940
just a balance between how strong those

808
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,079
priors are

809
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,839
that's my my take on it

810
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,300
awesome yeah exactly

811
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,579
um in the Bayesian inference modeling

812
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,599
setting

813
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,400
we could model

814
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,260
a case where

815
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,780
accurate information is coming in

816
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,160
which is to say that the generative

817
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,200
model has high precision

818
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,480
on the information coming in it's

819
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,820
updating priors a lot it has high

820
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,980
attention or salience so it's like

821
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,380
whatever the new information is it just

822
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,900
updates it's prior to that so to the

823
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,339
posterior becomes the incoming

824
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,320
observation that's the special case of

825
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,560
like a Time series filter with a depth

826
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,079
of one it's like whatever the last data

827
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,839
point is just go to that so that is

828
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:46,920
functionally direct perception

829
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,500
whereas if we have ambiguous information

830
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,380
coming in there's low Precision on

831
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,380
sensory data priors are not updating a

832
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,260
lot in low salience it's low attention

833
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,260
then the belief moving forward

834
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,320
is reflecting the a pre the a priori

835
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,500
stance the prior stance so

836
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,420
Bayesian inference is just giving us

837
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,880
computational tools and formal methods

838
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,480
to describe that possibility

839
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,760
so we can go from something that's being

840
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,859
updated

841
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,920
time Point by time point or not

842
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,440
but I've never seen any kind of useful

843
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,420
model presented other than just the

844
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,220
appeal to direct perception not saying

845
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,500
it's not there Brock and then anyone

846
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,619
else

847
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,720
um I just wanted to bring

848
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,520
um of something that

849
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,140
ali

850
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,280
um continues to remind people because I

851
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,700
think it's hard it's easy to forget or

852
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,720
not or look over here is that uh

853
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,900
we're using all this language about uh

854
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,500
you know vision and um in the context of

855
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,780
it like us a human and the brain and all

856
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,880
of this and

857
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,500
um actually

858
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,280
it's not uh that that sort of entails a

859
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,040
belief about the about active inference

860
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,599
being

861
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,200
um

862
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,520
physical

863
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,460
like that the blanket is physical that

864
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,140
the senses and the observations all

865
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,359
these you know actions are always kind

866
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,660
of purely physical

867
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,119
um or that the epistemic value the

868
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,920
pragmatic value well that's epistemic

869
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,540
that's information that's you know

870
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,900
pragmatic that's always action it's not

871
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,400
um so cleanly

872
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,980
that is actually an informational State

873
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,780
space that we're talking about that the

874
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,800
blankets in

875
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,079
right so it doesn't

876
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,820
um

877
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,040
if you remember that I guess is what I'm

878
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,060
saying

879
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,440
um

880
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,680
and that it is constrained in a physical

881
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,780
substrate like

882
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,980
you are in a space you are in a Time

883
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,260
um there are

884
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,660
you know additional there is a

885
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,280
generative process outside of you that

886
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,140
is constraining your generative model

887
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,839
like

888
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,820
there is a constraint of affordances

889
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,040
like you can't have

890
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,060
um

891
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,960
you you can't be a thing with an

892
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
attracting

893
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,619
characteristics like State space

894
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,339
um and like ignore that completely sort

895
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,060
of

896
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,000
um you will always have priors so to ask

897
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,240
like yeah what what

898
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,980
how is it that we have like direct

899
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,720
perception or

900
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,940
when are when are we ignoring our priors

901
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,160
that's back to this anthropomorphic like

902
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,220
purely physical thing it's like when do

903
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,960
the you know beliefs that statistical

904
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,440
beliefs kind of um

905
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,540
cancel out or something right with the

906
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,700
when when are they purely reflective of

907
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,579
the sense you know of the blank

908
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,960
um

909
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,660
that doesn't mean that you're ignoring

910
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,780
your priors it just means that like like

911
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,520
Daniel was saying is just a you know a

912
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,880
well-fit you know high resolution High

913
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
um

914
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,760
the expectation and the the blanket

915
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,980
state does the evolver are

916
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,460
uh you know low surprise

917
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,119
so

918
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,040
thanks thanks again just physically

919
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,660
constraint that's that's the important

920
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,520
part is you can't

921
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,079
you have to have beliefs you have to

922
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,880
have prayers and so

923
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,300
thank you yes it is a double-edged sword

924
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,839
with the appeals to physical organisms

925
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
because on one hand it kind of anchors

926
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,700
how we think about these informational

927
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,680
spaces and relationships

928
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,260
on the other hand it naturally leads to

929
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,540
a lot of important and interesting

930
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,859
questions

931
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,619
that very often it's mapped not

932
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,260
territory but if one doesn't know the

933
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,720
territory and is just learning the map

934
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,760
then it's it's no

935
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,200
bad thing

936
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,060
to ask questions that bump up against

937
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,940
map territory but to be aware that there

938
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,520
is a map territory relationship

939
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,160
that becomes clearer and clearer

940
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,400
as people learn about cartography how

941
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,920
the maps are built and why and as people

942
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,720
explore territory

943
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,980
and then

944
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,619
um yes some of the key

945
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,099
uh citations in this area

946
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,460
one of them would be the emperor's new

947
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,040
Markov blankets

948
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,560
which was from we we had some live

949
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,800
streams with yellow in 2021

950
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,520
and then most recently the blanket trick

951
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,560
which is a whole other story we're not

952
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,420
going to go into it again but I'll put

953
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,680
the link there

954
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,599
and um

955
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,300
it captured a lot of this discourse on

956
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,079
the blankets

957
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,380
okay in our last

958
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,900
um other than just the last thing um so

959
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,060
Jonathan I think wrote imagine seeing

960
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,619
something in low light or bright light

961
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,119
there's a Continuum of how strong the

962
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,099
priors will will

963
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:20,040
um influence I believe the inference

964
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,160
and that has been captured like in

965
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,740
psychophysics which is from a long time

966
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,940
ago

967
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,640
small changes in brightness are more

968
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,160
detectable in a dim room

969
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,599
so the question is how to bring these

970
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,599
kinds of empirical cognitive phenomena

971
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,880
into our statistics and inference

972
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,560
modeling methods

973
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,260
and

974
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,400
in the eyes of some

975
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,599
it's it's a done deal

976
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,020
so here Maxwell is saying like this was

977
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,420
never an issue

978
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,819
you get information theory in dynamical

979
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:09,060
systems theory naturally

980
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,980
so it was never an issue that doesn't

981
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,420
mean every single researcher was aware

982
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,240
of it but it wasn't an issue

983
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,099
and then

984
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:19,280
um

985
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,980
the map territory fallacy fallacy which

986
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,720
I'll also put in the chat

987
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,300
where they I we I think we've even

988
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,339
brought this up previously but

989
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,040
they argue that fep

990
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,079
is the ideal model

991
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,300
of these kinds of map territory

992
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,960
situations

993
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,880
but a lot of the frustrations are

994
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,819
related to different understandings and

995
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:51,359
framings of map territory so

996
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,099
anyone please feel free to raise your

997
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:57,060
hand just bring up any comments or

998
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,800
daughter question

999
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,480
otherwise we'll take a look at one or

1000
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,240
two more of the chapter one questions

1001
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,959
that people had

1002
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,839
ever yes

1003
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,599
yeah so so as you probably remember I I

1004
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:15,420
work as a physical therapist and I treat

1005
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,920
people with mainly chronic pain and I it

1006
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,920
is quite uh essential to make a stand as

1007
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,940
to

1008
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,140
uh uh perception being inferential or

1009
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,460
direct because if uh pain is the

1010
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,819
experience that comes about uh

1011
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:42,140
by integrating priors and likelihoods

1012
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,839
and you could make a case that the

1013
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,420
priors are

1014
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,980
let's say male adaptive and are

1015
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,200
determining the the ongoing pain

1016
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,579
experience

1017
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:57,660
and instead of the likelihood uh in this

1018
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,760
in this example

1019
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,500
but

1020
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,480
um yeah

1021
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,420
if that's not the case then that has

1022
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,460
quite some implications for the way I

1023
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,160
treat people so that's why it's also

1024
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,079
very clinically relevant to uh yeah

1025
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,740
to have a good good uh reason to say

1026
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,420
okay I'm going for this inferential

1027
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,119
computational explanation of uh

1028
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,940
perception so just to to highlight where

1029
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,700
this uh question is coming from

1030
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,280
thank you yeah that's a great point and

1031
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,140
So like

1032
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,060
um we're going to come to this later but

1033
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,220
with cognitive modeling so let's just

1034
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,839
say again whether or not it's really

1035
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,359
direct or inferential in the world we're

1036
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,220
going to be using Bayesian inference as

1037
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,140
a tool

1038
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,020
and we find that somebody is engaging in

1039
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,680
some behavior that we don't prefer it's

1040
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,300
like a child doing something that we

1041
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,220
don't prefer or the person has expressed

1042
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,900
that they don't prefer it or however it

1043
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,740
is

1044
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,960
with cognitive models

1045
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,020
it's possible to ask or differentiate

1046
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,700
kind of like a differential diagnosis

1047
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,680
and Ryan Smith and others have done a

1048
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,920
lot of work in this area like is the

1049
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,920
person repeatedly taking this action

1050
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,660
because they think that it leads to

1051
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,579
positive outcomes

1052
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:21,359
so that it's a learning failure to

1053
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,880
understand the consequences of action

1054
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,160
or do they have a preference for that

1055
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,560
outcome those are two different clinical

1056
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,240
situations

1057
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,760
does this person prefer

1058
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,640
X outcome and they are taking the

1059
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,800
approach that makes sense at which point

1060
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,300
you'd want to be like hey it's really

1061
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,480
cool to be X

1062
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,099
and then

1063
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:46,500
figured that they'll take the right path

1064
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,480
or do they know that they want to be

1065
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,599
somewhere but they are not clicking on

1066
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,339
the consequences of their action in

1067
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:56,400
taking them to that goal so that kind of

1068
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,319
differential diagnosis and like you said

1069
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,680
is it like that the person has

1070
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,500
um a high prior likelihood on well

1071
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,560
people like me have this kind of pain at

1072
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,540
which point maybe any stimuli might

1073
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,460
interpret it as as that type of pain

1074
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,220
because it's likely right why not

1075
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,540
or

1076
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,579
is it

1077
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,220
a sensory attenuation is it a

1078
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,800
sensitivity to something it it could be

1079
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,660
any number of things so we can still use

1080
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,260
this differential diagnosis

1081
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,300
paradigm

1082
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,099
a little bit one step closer to being

1083
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,079
operationalized it doesn't need to pull

1084
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,900
back to like direct or inference

1085
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,599
philosophy

1086
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,599
within the maps that we can make you can

1087
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,339
still ask about the relative

1088
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:50,400
contribution of prior's likelihood

1089
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,540
sensory observations and so on

1090
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,880
but I think that's these are the exact

1091
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,359
kinds of application Avenues

1092
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:03,000
where hearing people's like insights and

1093
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,220
questions on which parts of this

1094
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,380
framework are relevant for them as they

1095
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,060
continue to go deeper into it it's like

1096
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,560
that's what is great to see

1097
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,400
okay

1098
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,839
well

1099
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,780
let's look at where we're going to be

1100
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,099
going in the coming weeks and chapters

1101
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,859
so we're having our second discussion on

1102
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,780
chapter one chapter one there was no

1103
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,640
equations it was giving some big

1104
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,220
overviews and laying out a lot of the

1105
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,920
big picture for active inference as the

1106
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,839
authors see it

1107
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,619
then we're gonna have two weeks as we go

1108
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,680
into a lot of the substance of the book

1109
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,559
chapter two three four and five okay

1110
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,319
what are those chapters gonna be about

1111
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,980
well chapter two and three

1112
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,740
are going to describe the low road and

1113
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,040
the high road to active inference and

1114
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,140
we're going to talk probably a ton about

1115
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,780
low road and high road

1116
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,900
um

1117
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,640
the low road and and we can come up with

1118
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,619
just tables and tables of concordances

1119
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:20,280
it'll be really fun the low road is in a

1120
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,380
way asking how

1121
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,800
how with Bayesian statistics this is how

1122
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,480
we're going to do it this is how these

1123
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,460
Maps work this is how these models work

1124
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,680
active inference is about cognitive

1125
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,079
modeling how are those models being

1126
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,960
implemented Bayes theorem not every

1127
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,660
Bayesian statistics equation has to do

1128
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,059
with cognition and action and perception

1129
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,540
you could have a Bayesian statistics

1130
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,059
model of something that wasn't an active

1131
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,480
agent but we're interested in the

1132
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,220
generative models

1133
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,319
that do perception

1134
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,559
and action and planning as an inference

1135
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,420
challenge

1136
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,380
and then in the case of brains that has

1137
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,180
been called the Bayesian brain approach

1138
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:11,700
so how Bayes theorem chapter 2 low road

1139
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,879
foreign

1140
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,119
is coming from the imperative for

1141
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,819
persistence or for survival or for

1142
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:24,240
repeated measurement so

1143
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,940
treat it lightly when we talk about the

1144
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,619
imperative for persistence and I know

1145
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,180
we've had some discussions even last

1146
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,339
week on what about these kinds of

1147
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:35,280
um seemingly self-inflicted injuries and

1148
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,559
all of this but just from a statistical

1149
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,880
perspective

1150
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,940
something has to persist long enough to

1151
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,800
be measured as being that thing

1152
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,140
otherwise you won't measure it at that

1153
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,420
thing like if you're taking measurements

1154
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,760
every hour and the cloud is dissipating

1155
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,740
every five seconds

1156
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,079
you're not going to see that cloud

1157
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,180
if the cloud is dissipating on the

1158
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,559
hourly time scale and you're measuring

1159
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,780
it every five seconds there's going to

1160
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,599
be some equations that you can use to

1161
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,940
model the cloud moving or growing and

1162
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,700
changing so that's coming from The High

1163
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,339
Road this imperative

1164
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,200
for persistence

1165
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,140
which becomes operationalized

1166
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,240
in a way that's compatible with Bayesian

1167
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,880
statistics through this concept of

1168
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,339
self-evidencing and the reduction of

1169
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:27,000
surprise about one's own perceptions

1170
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,400
like if you're unsurprised that you're

1171
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,800
in homeostasis

1172
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,540
you're going to be persisting as that

1173
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,400
kind of thing if you find yourself

1174
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,339
surprised at your homeostatic parameters

1175
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:40,140
it won't be long until you are not that

1176
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,300
kind of thing

1177
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,619
chapters two and three low road how

1178
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:48,839
High Road why

1179
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,319
those are importantly the low road to

1180
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,440
active inference High Road two active

1181
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,359
inference

1182
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,400
that's going to bring us to chapter four

1183
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,520
generative models of active inference

1184
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,619
that's where we're going to see the

1185
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,579
kernel

1186
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:10,619
that is situated on one hand using Bayes

1187
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,960
theorem as a how

1188
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,079
and explaining self-organization and

1189
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,619
persistence in terms of why

1190
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,319
chapter 5 is then going to talk about

1191
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,720
the setting where octave inference

1192
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,240
generative models have been studied most

1193
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,640
extensively to this point which is the

1194
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,160
mammalian nervous system

1195
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,780
so that is going to bring up a lot of

1196
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,300
examples from the Central and the

1197
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,140
peripheral nervous system of mammals and

1198
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,000
talk about how generative models have

1199
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,140
been used

1200
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,300
to study those kinds of phenomena that

1201
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,520
people are interested in from motor

1202
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,660
Behavior to decision making

1203
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,180
that's the first half of the book so

1204
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,140
we've kind of like

1205
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,200
gone in the skateboarding ramp or like

1206
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,140
the ski jump or whatever it is that is

1207
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,819
like chapter one it's kind of like going

1208
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,740
over the edge

1209
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,240
and now

1210
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,800
we're going to have more equations

1211
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,900
and some technical pieces are going to

1212
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,099
be introduced along these two roads

1213
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:23,339
and just like with everything it's many

1214
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:24,960
coats of paint

1215
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,760
so

1216
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,640
read through it and and ask questions

1217
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,099
every question is important so even if

1218
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,420
it's a very big what does this letter

1219
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,599
mean why is this here

1220
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,160
what would this mean if it doesn't

1221
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,079
didn't have to be this way

1222
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,980
how does this apply to this setting

1223
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,020
how does this help us do this or that

1224
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,040
like any structure of question

1225
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,500
if each of us can come up with a few

1226
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,319
we'll have many

1227
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,880
and um

1228
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,960
yeah

1229
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,180
specifically let's just look at what

1230
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,940
will come to in chapter two and then

1231
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,839
we'll close

1232
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,880
William James my thinking first and last

1233
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,579
and always for the sake of my doing this

1234
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,800
kind of speaks to this essential

1235
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,980
embedding of action in inference in

1236
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,540
active inference

1237
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,520
we start with perception as inference so

1238
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,500
that's going to cover some of the topics

1239
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,059
that we talked about today

1240
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:30,000
Box 2 1 is going to introduce Bayes

1241
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,540
theorem and probabilistic reasoning

1242
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,220
there's going to be an example that

1243
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,839
comes back a few times with a person

1244
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,819
holding something in their hand it could

1245
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,920
be a frog or an apple and then it's

1246
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,420
going to jump or not

1247
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,460
and we're going to model our uncertainty

1248
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,800
about what that object is based upon

1249
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,000
what we observe it to do

1250
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,260
there's going to be some discussion of

1251
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,540
basic statistical Concepts

1252
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,780
like support and expectation

1253
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,059
that is going to be applied in the

1254
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:02,339
setting of The generative process and

1255
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:03,720
the generative model

1256
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,180
process like the niche model like the

1257
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,040
cognitive agents

1258
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,079
action as inference previously we were

1259
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,700
talking about perception as inference

1260
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,339
now action is going to be treated as a

1261
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:16,079
variable that you can do

1262
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,420
inference on

1263
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,740
both perception and action can be used

1264
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,260
to reduce discrepancies which will also

1265
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,540
have a technical definition

1266
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,760
variational free energy is going to be

1267
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,579
introduced as a statistical measure that

1268
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,839
helps us bounce surprise

1269
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,640
and it will be shown what that means

1270
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,700
and then expected free energy is going

1271
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,059
to be introduced as a way that is as a

1272
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:48,180
way that different policies about the

1273
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,040
future different sequences of actions

1274
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,839
can be compared with each other

1275
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,500
special cases of expected free energy

1276
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,780
collapse to various other important

1277
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,760
settings like if there's no information

1278
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,400
to glean you can pursue pragmatic value

1279
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,500
if there's no pragmatic value to pursue

1280
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,800
you can purely pursue informational ends

1281
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,300
and that's the end of the low road

1282
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,339
thank you everybody

1283
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,940
farewell
