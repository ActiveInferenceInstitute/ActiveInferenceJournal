1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,940
hello everyone

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,199
welcome to the active inference par at

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,240
all textbook group

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,219
welcome to cohort three

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,420
Our Journey Begins

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,800
here

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,300
it is uh January 25th 2023

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,800
and this is an onboarding and overview

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,099
meeting so as with all meetings it is

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,359
being recorded

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,059
we know that no single meeting time will

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,440
accommodate every single person's

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,559
schedule every time so live meetings of

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,920
this type are recorded and then later in

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,780
this day like 10 hours from now or

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,760
something there's the office hours

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,120
optional as everything is in Discord

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,820
and these meetings

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,879
um

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,079
are recorded they'll be available here

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,480
so for example you can see from cohort 2

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,520
there will be like a link for the video

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,120
recording

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,479
this first meeting is onboarding and

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,560
overview

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,760
so

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,700
the first part is going to be

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,740
going over the textbook group and the

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,799
structure of the coda which I know looks

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,520
large but it is possible to focus in and

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,140
Steward the parts that you're interested

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,979
in and not the parts that you're not

33
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,280
so I'm going to give an overview of the

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,580
structure of the textbook group in terms

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,200
of synchronous and asynchronous

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,640
participation and in the zoom chat

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,820
please feel free to ask any questions

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,380
you want just so that we can address

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,460
them

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,000
the goal here is to reduce your

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,979
uncertainty increase your confidence

42
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,500
around participating

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,439
there are so many ways to participate

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,540
and we want to welcome and accommodate

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
and encourage everyone coming from

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,159
totally different

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,439
learning preferences and backgrounds

48
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,160
so I'm starting on the very top left of

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,199
our Coda and the link has been put in

50
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,720
the chat and also note that I'm using

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,920
dark mode so Coda might look like that

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,079
but I'm using it in dark mode

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,160
welcome to the active inference

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
Institute

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,879
many people

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,300
um here in this room right now I I know

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,780
have been fundamental and with us for

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,700
years others this might be one of your

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,900
first times joining that's all great and

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll put this link in the chat

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,360
the textbook group is one of many

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,980
activities that are ongoing at The

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,140
Institute so here we are in the portal

64
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,519
textbook group

65
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,860
and there's other Education and Research

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,260
oriented activities that you can explore

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,959
and and find out more about

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,480
but for now we're going to be focused on

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
the textbook group and we'll reach out

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
to other sources and places

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,140
as we need

72
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,379
the textbook itself is open source we

73
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,980
are talking about the textbook from

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,720
2022.

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,300
the active inference textbook by par

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,239
bazulo and Tristan and it's an open

77
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,000
source textbook which is awesome that

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
allows us to

79
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,860
facilitate us of course working in this

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,800
way and also it allows you to download

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,379
the textbook so you can download the PDF

82
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,440
right here and I know there's some other

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
efforts that some of you have

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,940
started involving like making it a

85
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,540
living textbook

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,739
the directory page and you can hide and

87
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,940
show

88
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,560
the sidebar sorry one second

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,840
the directory page has information on

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,620
different sections of the coda and what

91
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,900
you can find there

92
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,680
live meeting page summarizes when our

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,420
live meetings are happening

94
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,819
and we're specifically in cohort three

95
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,739
so here we are

96
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,100

contact me on this way at this time or

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,919
if you're interested in that like you

107
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,199
can add that here for connecting within

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,720
the cohort and then there's that cohort

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,320
3 live meetings page that has the the

110
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,240
date and time

111
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,740
of all of our meetings and that's where

112
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,300
the video recordings are going to be

113
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,220
placed as well

114
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,620
broadly today we're here to go on an

115
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,560
overview take any introductory thoughts

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,360
and questions

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,160
and also hear from each other like what

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,139
are we excited to learn and what is

119
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,300
going to motivate Us in this

120
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,120
optional but extremely exciting and

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,840
useful Quest that we're on

122
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,240
then we will have two weeks per chapter

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,139
the chapters are not super long so two

124
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,240
weeks is a good amount of time

125
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,800
to

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,680
give reading and or listening to it a

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,860
chance

128
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,000
take notes and we'll talk more about

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,800
what that can look like and be but on

130
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,380
the uh meeting for a given chapter

131
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,139
we're going to focus on that chapter and

132
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,460
sometimes again we'll reach into other

133
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,620
resources but we're gonna

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,259
focus our attention on the focal chapter

135
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,600
and then to a slightly lesser extent

136
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,039
other parts of the textbook because

137
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,360
people might have a question that like

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
oh that's going to come up in chapter

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,419
seven or that's going to come up in

140
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,759
chapter three and then

141
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,060
this textbook is not the only

142
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,539
star in the constellation of emerging

143
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,400
active inference literature and so

144
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,900
there's going to be many times where

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,380
we'll reference like other papers

146
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,680
uh other programs and especially we'll

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,560
reference a lot of the live streams the

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
several hundred paper oriented and model

149
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,259
oriented live streams that we've done at

150
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,840
the Institute and so many of the

151
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,400
critical papers and uh researchers we've

152
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,660
highlighted in these streams so it's

153
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,300
like a really awesome resource

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,039
okay

155
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,460
um as for onboarding and participation

156
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,539
so

157
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,319
these are all evolving documents and in

158
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,180
an evolving

159
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,900
open science Creative Commons space

160
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,100
so with our participation in synchronous

161
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,780
and asynchronous

162
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,720
Institute affordances like the Zoom room

163
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,440
and this Coda were agreeing and abiding

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,460
by

165
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,979
rules of General respect and also of the

166
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,759
um like open source status of what we're

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,380
collaborating on here

168
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,500
and we are students in the textbook

169
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,340
group we're focused on learning it's

170
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,440
going to lead many of us towards project

171
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,639
ideas and collaborations which were also

172
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,620
very excited to facilitate

173
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,460
we

174
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,240
expect and prefer and hope you to be an

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,099
Engaged learner

176
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,800
though there may be multiple types and

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,060
levels of novelty or frictions so

178
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,360
communicate early communicate often let

179
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,860
us know how we can improve things for

180
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,639
you

181
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,419
there's a lot of opportunities and

182
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,819
bandwidth to help you literally

183
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,180
specifically with what you want so make

184
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,319
it known and hopefully with this very

185
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,020
capable and diverse group we can make it

186
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,699
happen

187
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,620
we've also included some students

188
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,020
practices you can just click these

189
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,940
sections away if you're not

190
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,800
meeting them or not interested in the

191
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,919
moment but students practices like what

192
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,440
is it to really learn active inference

193
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,180
what are we really doing from a verb

194
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,820
perspective and so here are some

195
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,640
suggestions and some options

196
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,899
ranging from annotating writing

197
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,219
systematic reading

198
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,700
having Leisure Time making programming

199
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,440
constructions

200
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,720
adding questions adding ideas and

201
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
insights adding projects there's many

202
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,440
ways that we can participate and be

203
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,820
involved and if like you're finding

204
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,380
something that's exciting and engaging

205
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,360
for you and you feel like it's adding

206
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,880
value to your active inference learning

207
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,600
like let's add it other Learners may be

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,160
interested in it too

209
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,300
so

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,880
that's overall what participation is

211
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,880
like this is the pace or the Rhythm that

212
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,040
we'll be following in the sessions that

213
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,019
are weekly at this time we're going to

214
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,940
get in the next three months through the

215
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,100
first half of the book which is like a

216
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,080
lot of the conceptual and theoretical

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
underpinnings and then the second half

218
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,380
of the book is uh about a recipe for

219
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,240
modeling itself so you can see like

220
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,700
cohort 2 who meets actually an hour

221
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,380
before this if you ever want to join

222
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,540
welcome to same link

223
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,019
from September to November 22. we went

224
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,180
through chapter one through five and now

225
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,860
we're going through chapter six or ten

226
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,260
and so we'll do something similar like

227
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,820
from

228
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,360
May to August we'll go through chapters

229
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,580
six through ten again everybody can join

230
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,620
everything go through multiple times in

231
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,420
the beginning or however it's going to

232
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,480
work out in your life and practice

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,459
but we're going to be having this pace

234
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,980
with a recorded video meetings

235
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,500
going through chapters one through five

236
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
in the coming months

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,300
and then the prime if that is all you

238
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,279
have bandwidth for that's great

239
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,920
however to engage with the material on

240
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,500
your own time is really where the

241
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,779
learning is going to happen and some of

242
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,180
your edits and contributions on your own

243
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,940
time will be in this Coda as well in

244
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,800
sections that we'll look at others will

245
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,240
be in your own documents

246
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,519
so join when you can watch the video

247
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,019
recordings when you can

248
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,019
comment early comment often

249
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,540
let us know how we can help and improve

250
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,740
things

251
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,519
so let's go into first just any generals

252
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,680
questions on this and then we'll go into

253
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,140
like the textbook itself and how we use

254
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,579
Coda around the textbook

255
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,040
all right

256
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,319
in the textbook section itself

257
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,019
this textbook is

258
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,360
the first active inference textbook and

259
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
it's the first version of the first

260
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,320
active inference textbook there's a lot

261
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,700
of other

262
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,760
uh critical work

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
like vital work as well as skeptical

264
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,140
work

265
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,600
and Carl furston

266
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,420
who's one of the central researchers

267
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,620
in this field and part of azulo to

268
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,540
younger researchers who have worked with

269
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,380
friston have created this first version

270
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,660
of a first textbook published at the end

271
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,220
of March 2022 so about eight months ago

272
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,320
um

273
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,720
it's a big moment for our field and you

274
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,240
here are all some of the very first to

275
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,640
be going through this textbook which is

276
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,200
positioned as friston has said towards a

277
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,260
master student in computational

278
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,940
neuropsychiatry looking to apply this to

279
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,700
their own research that may literally

280
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,459
describe some of you others may have

281
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,500
quite a different context doesn't mean

282
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,120
it's going to be

283
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,300
um not fit for you in fact it's been

284
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,720
exciting to see how many different

285
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,860
backgrounds and people have resonated

286
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,880
with this textbook and with of course

287
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,180
all the related work so this is like

288
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,459
um a flag in the ground for active

289
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,560
inference but also this isn't a One-Stop

290
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,019
shop so anywhere that you're like I wish

291
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,220
they would have explained this or what

292
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,620
is the meaning of that like that is what

293
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,420
we're doing in this group

294
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,640
importantly this textbook doesn't have

295
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,100
any questions there's no um assessment

296
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,420
or

297
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,940
um basic comprehension questions

298
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,639
and that is also a huge aspect of what

299
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,959
our work is here

300
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,399
so

301
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,139
um to go through just some of these

302
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,980
pages and how we use the coda there are

303
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,720
some equations in this book you might

304
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,420
have noticed

305
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,420
how do we plan to understand and work

306
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,880
with these equations

307
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,139
recognizing everyone's different

308
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,920
capacities and preferences for equations

309
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,320
well one thing that we do is for every

310
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,480
equation and this work has been done by

311
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,760
previous cohorts so now we're in the

312
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,120
like improve phase not the first

313
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
construction phase

314
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,120
for every equation we have a screenshot

315
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,360
and a verbal description so anywhere in

316
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,160
the coda someone can be like I'm curious

317
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,459
about equation at 2.5

318
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,399
Mouse over it what is it oh okay okay

319
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,459
equation 2.5 cool well what but what is

320
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,180
it what does it mean

321
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,860
oh the variational free energy is ETC so

322
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,240
here's the natural language description

323
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,320
of these equations

324
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm just muting people who are making a

325
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,440
little noise thank you

326
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,040
um

327
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,660
so

328
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,420
you'll gain familiarity with Coda and

329
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,940
how everything looks but when you see a

330
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,480
a canvas that you can pop out

331
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,700
you can find

332
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,620
um a natural language description and

333
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,480
it's not there for every single one so

334
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,560
these are like

335
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,839
the exact kind of contributions that

336
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,959
people can make that have extremely high

337
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,420
Leverage

338
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,300
anywhere that you can add a description

339
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,839
or add comments or notes add it in latex

340
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,399
those are like the kinds of local

341
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,760
improvements that in our group context

342
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,579
with like 30 plus future cohorts of us

343
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,800
here can be like actually

344
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,120
transformational I mean equation 2.5 is

345
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,820
one of the essential equations

346
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,639
how can we come to understand it well we

347
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,260
can have discussion we can ask questions

348
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,579
on it

349
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,160
we can do like what Jacob had previously

350
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,440
done like show how the lines of the

351
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
equation are related to each other so

352
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,860
there's an incredible amount of work

353
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,320
that we can do around improving the

354
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,000
equations and Coda facilitates us using

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,139
every row

356
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,660
as something that can be referred to

357
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,720
so that's equations we have figures

358
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,540
also every figure has been brought in

359
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,540
not everything is fully tagged or fully

360
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,279
described but

361
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,160
figure 2.2 oh there it is so we can use

362
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,540
it and refer reference to it as like

363
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,519
something stable and that's something

364
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,680
that we can ask questions about and so

365
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,380
on boxes and tables all of those have

366
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,699
been brought in

367
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:45,240
the code page this may or may not be

368
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,740
relevant for the first half of the book

369
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,360
for you depending on where you're at

370
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,560
with code

371
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,980
but we have a lot of active inference

372
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,260
code implementations

373
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,660
and um

374
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,660
we can go more into this as people want

375
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,540
to but there are a lot of code-based

376
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,760
implementations especially in Python but

377
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,920
also in Matlab and other languages for

378
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,560
people who want to like see

379
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,620
what it looks like in a program form and

380
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,000
something that we'll come back to again

381
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,980
and again it's just always a Nexus to

382
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,399
develop is we're going to be talking

383
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,240
about math natural language graphical

384
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,720
visualizations and art

385
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,940
programming philosophy like we're going

386
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,560
to have a lot of different things coming

387
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,639
together

388
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,880
there's no single path within active

389
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,639
inference or two active inference

390
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
people have difference backgrounds and

391
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,579
familiarities with different areas and

392
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,040
so maybe for one person it's like the

393
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,259
philosophical implications that are

394
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,820
exciting for you and then you'll come to

395
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,860
see the programming maybe somebody else

396
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,100
sees the programming adjacency and then

397
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,259
they'll come to be excited about the

398
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,420
philosophy or about how to visualize it

399
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,820
so we'll be moving across those domains

400
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,439
and

401
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,220
um

402
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,540
yes there is a facet of daunting scope

403
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,559
we're here in a new context and this is

404
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,500
an opportunity to

405
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,199
learn the way that we want to learn and

406
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,500
that is learning actively

407
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,160
in chapters notes and questions

408
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,980
um we have like some sections that if

409
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,240
you want to zoom in on a specific

410
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,220
chapter so here's like the table of

411
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,380
contents and then here's a the fine

412
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,840
scale table of contents with the

413
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
sections

414
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
um so somebody can say like I'm talking

415
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,520
about section at 1.4.2

416
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,340
again maybe that's like relevant and you

417
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,020
won't do that but we we do reference

418
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,220
different sections and then that makes

419
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,960
it okay that's what this section's about

420
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,760
here's what page it's on

421
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,600
um

422
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,440
within a given chapter like chapter one

423
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,799
there is a subset of questions that have

424
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,900
been asked on chapter one

425
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
and then also there's just other

426
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,400
discourse on these pages

427
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,900
and so we have those for all the

428
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,200
chapters and for the appendices

429
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,840
that's the textbook section it's

430
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,640
primarily just focused on stripping out

431
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,100
and re-formatting the material of the

432
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,780
textbook so that it can be referenced

433
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,500
and enriched to this extent like

434
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,539
everywhere that equation 2.5 is used

435
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,940
it's augmented by what we've added to

436
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,100
this table so

437
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,460
Mark once used many times

438
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,860
in the discourse on the textbook this is

439
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
like really where the creativity and the

440
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,100
generativity of our cohorts is going to

441
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,780
shine

442
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,539
we want to facilitate Active Learning

443
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,299
and a huge element of active learning is

444
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,539
this question based um perspective

445
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,840
so here's an overall questions table

446
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,960
and also there's a filter View

447
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,480
that will only be for our cohort

448
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,460
I

449
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,020
believe someone has already added a

450
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,640
bunch of questions for chapter one which

451
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,919
is awesome

452
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,720
um like

453
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,539
the questions are shown on the left and

454
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,520
you can just add by hitting enter and

455
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,679
just adding a new question down here and

456
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,600
then also you can pop up the answers in

457
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,280
discourse

458
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,400
so here it and also I'm using control

459
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,799
and plus or minus or control and scroll

460
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,200
to make Coda bigger or smaller that can

461
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,179
be quite useful

462
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,240
um

463
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,360
these questions that people have asked

464
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,880
range from basic

465
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,919
and testing comprehension of even very

466
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,039
yes or no or multiple choice

467
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,340
all the way to really the kind of

468
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,440
connections and relationships that are

469
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,000
the substance of having fluency and

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,080
comprehensive understanding of active

471
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,320
inference on through speculative

472
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
philosophy questions and open areas of

473
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,940
research

474
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,700
if each one of us here

475
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,020
added like one question per week

476
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,140
and refined

477
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,080
zero or a few questions of discourse

478
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,960
we would have a truly transformationally

479
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,299
different active inference learning

480
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,760
environment worldwide

481
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,080
and I don't think that's an

482
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,340
overstatement

483
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,160
there are not many groups working on

484
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,860
this textbook especially in this

485
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,080
collaborative capacity

486
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,179
the textbook doesn't have any questions

487
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,600
associated with it and we're very close

488
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
with the authors

489
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,120
we're going to have opportunities to use

490
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,299
what we're developing here broadly

491
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,820
and play a role in the future of active

492
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,320
inference education

493
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,120
that's one of the most important reasons

494
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,280
why adding questions and refining

495
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,059
questions is so critical like we've all

496
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,460
heard oh if you have the question then X

497
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,500
number of other people in this room or

498
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,080
lecture might as well

499
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,660
that is is and will be happening

500
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,520
globally

501
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,220
when we use the active inference

502
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,260
ontology which I'll come to after

503
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,620
showing the other sections we also can

504
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,659
leverage our questions in the discourse

505
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:40,500
on them

506
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,780
and in the live meetings

507
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,539
what we'll tend to do is focus on

508
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,640
questions that haven't been addressed

509
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,620
yet that have been upvoted as

510
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,820
interesting

511
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,760
like we'll just pop it open and let

512
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,220
people share and we'll all open up this

513
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,559
and we'll start taking down some

514
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,960
thoughts and questions and we're just

515
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,820
like getting it on

516
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,440
the page

517
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,500
being active making contributions it

518
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,600
doesn't need to be unified or

519
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,080
consistent in the initial framing but

520
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,000
these are the kinds of things that are

521
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,440
going to help people in their

522
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,059
synchronous and asynchronous active

523
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,200
learning

524
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,659
for this textbook and even Beyond

525
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,700
because a lot of these questions are of

526
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,960
course more General

527
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
ideas and insights is like if you just

528
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,340
want to lock in

529
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,940
idea or an Insight you had

530
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,520
and just crystallize that so that others

531
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,799
can see that oh chapter one I was like

532
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,840
oh

533
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,059
here's what this means

534
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,740
might be shocking for some might be

535
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,360
incomprehensible for some it's all good

536
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480
just when you add in here

537
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,240
it becomes part of our Collective space

538
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,220
so I highlight questions a lot because

539
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,559
that is one of the most important ways

540
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,760
that we can

541
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,539
um

542
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,360
increment our understanding and go from

543
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,919
that like moment of friction or

544
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,240
uncertainty like what does that mean or

545
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,620
why doesn't they Define this or what is

546
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,940
this equation doing here what does that

547
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,980
figure mean it's like in that moment of

548
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,240
not understanding

549
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,039
make the choice to write down the

550
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,059
question

551
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,400
and our group will have an exponential

552
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,919
capacity but if everybody just wonders

553
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,080
about it and nobody writes a question or

554
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,440
augments the question then it's going to

555
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,240
be like we're all moving ahead linearly

556
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,280
the math learning group so um this is

557
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,320
active to the extent that people want it

558
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,880
to be

559
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,400
it was a suggestion and uh brought

560
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,020
forward by some of the participants in

561
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,700
the first cohort and in this little

562
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,799
subsection which again put it aside if

563
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,299
you don't want to

564
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,320
we really wanted to focus on the

565
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,919
foundational understanding of the math

566
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,460
that's one of the stickiest parts of

567
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,919
this field

568
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:57,659
and it is

569
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,539
also fundamental like the relationship

570
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,299
between surprise uncertainty in Hidden

571
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,179
states that relationship isn't

572
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,340
a poem it's beautiful but also there is

573
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,539
um

574
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,000
mathematics that underlies these topics

575
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,240
and we want it to be accessible and

576
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,880
rigorous for all so in this section

577
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,500
which again if somebody wants to like

578
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,539
Steward this math learning group

579
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,539
and bring together basic resources on

580
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,299
Matrix algebra on stochastic systems on

581
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,820
calculus or wants to write summaries

582
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,620
like some have done

583
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,299
that

584
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,860
come through

585
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,960
the um

586
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,780
sections

587
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,120
those are super useful

588
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,340
Jana any thoughts on being stuck or not

589
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,799
having questions

590
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,500
it's not required to ask questions so if

591
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,340
the expression that you have in response

592
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,840
to the material

593
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,299
is not question oriented if it doesn't

594
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,460
pose itself as a question

595
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,559
it's all good or as a question every

596
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,760
time it's all good

597
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,380
and so what is it that affords the

598
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,600
emergence of questions whatever it is

599
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,240
when it emerges feel free to capture it

600
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,320
if it emerges as something different

601
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,320
or even something ineffable or

602
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
non-active in that moment it's also all

603
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,820
good

604
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,039
add any other comments or feel free to

605
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,419
add things but like

606
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,220
number one imperatives to stay in the

607
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,000
game

608
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,299
stay engaged

609
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,600
and if we live to play another day we

610
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,159
advance our knowledge of active

611
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,260
inference and just for like a little

612
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,940
context this is something that would be

613
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,159
taught in a graduate school

614
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,559
optional seminar

615
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,059
for some of you that might literally

616
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,980
describe you but for those who are

617
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,320
stepping into something that from a

618
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,120
legacy perspective isn't what they would

619
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,299
be stepping into like

620
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,400
they're

621
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
at least I personally but I also hope

622
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,539
more broadly that The Bravery of that

623
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,820
could be understood

624
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,640
in project ideas

625
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,260
uh

626
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,140
participants have added various project

627
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,640
ideas

628
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,159
so contact these people or like add your

629
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,159
own ideas anything from doing audiobook

630
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,760
recordings to specific modeling

631
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
different educational

632
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,980
um possibilities

633
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,720
mathematical derivations so improving

634
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,000
like on one hand the rigor while we're

635
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,100
also working on the other hand

636
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,799
with accessibility keeping those

637
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,840
integrated

638
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,539
resources and may become relevant and

639
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,900
Ali contributed this initial table

640
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,659
it may become relevant to refer to other

641
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,200
resources so you'll find a lot of other

642
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,360
materials here

643
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,100
and in future textbook groups there's

644
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,320
like a feedback form

645
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,500
which will update at the end so that we

646
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,179
can give our feedback and then also like

647
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,919
uh if you want to share the link for

648
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,539
people who want to join future cohorts

649
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,260
and also just add like other feedback

650
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,020
like what can

651
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,480
a voluntary global

652
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,000
textbook Group B

653
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,340
how can we learn and apply

654
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,960
active inference

655
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,340
those are our some of our questions

656
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,380
um erada

657
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,799
are a few little typos and not just like

658
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,299
conceptual uncertainties but would

659
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,419
appear to be typos in the book

660
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,080
and also I'll note that on 17 UTC on

661
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,980
February 27th Thomas Parr will be

662
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,260
joining for live stream first author of

663
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,279
The textbook

664
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,539
so

665
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,460
in the next month

666
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,100
we will like highlight certain questions

667
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,620
that we want to surface when Thomas

668
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,480
joins it'll be like in a zoom just like

669
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,039
this

670
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,779
of course it'll be recorded

671
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,000
also if anybody like wants to join we

672
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,260
can talk about this in the coming weeks

673
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,140
but this is really awesome and unique

674
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,919
opportunity to ask Thomas directly

675
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,980
certain questions that we have so that

676
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,000
should be awesome okay last section and

677
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,500
then we'll go into more open uh uh group

678
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,820
discussion

679
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,360
this active inference tables section

680
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,400
has a few tables

681
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,539
uh that are going to be very useful

682
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,419
this is the active inference ontology

683
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,580
the active inference ontology is a a

684
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,640
central project since the earliest days

685
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,100
of active Institute

686
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,380
and one can see a little bit more about

687
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,260
it at this public site but there's also

688
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,059
more to it

689
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,080
um

690
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,260
the ontology at this point consists of

691
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,799
definitions and translations for a

692
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,799
reduced set of 74 core terms

693
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,940
and

694
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,220
a slightly broader list of supplemental

695
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,620
terms terms that are maybe not vital

696
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,320
like as prerequisites for understanding

697
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,299
octave but they're things that we might

698
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,539
mention like when we're learning and

699
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,720
this is again the public ontology site

700
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,220
so here we have

701
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,919
natural language definitions

702
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,500
four different terms just like a

703
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,440
dictionary uses natural language terms

704
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,299
to describe other natural language terms

705
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,679
that's what we're doing in the active

706
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,940
ontology

707
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,659
and just like being fluent in a language

708
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:46,200
means that you can recognize and use

709
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,020
the language understand what the

710
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,179
entities and the terms are the topics

711
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,000
and how they're related and why

712
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,080
this is a set of terms where if one is

713
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,919
fluent in perceiving and acting upon

714
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,640
them one has fluidity in active

715
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,320
inference

716
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,200
also the ontology

717
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,480
has translations so we have translations

718
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,039
into

719
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,539
um Spanish Portuguese French Italian

720
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,940
Czech Russian Hebrew Persian Chinese

721
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,260
Japanese

722
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,679
um Limited in Hindi and Turkish

723
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,020
if you want to improve one of these

724
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,140
ontology language translations

725
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,120
or you want to add another language that

726
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,159
is like an incredible service because

727
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,480
let's think back to that equation 2.5

728
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,720
when we see this blue text

729
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,179
these are ontology terms so the natural

730
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,000
language definition can pop up and when

731
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,380
we want to type something we can do like

732
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,580
at

733
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,080
generative model

734
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,320
we can then Translate

735
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,779
into other languages

736
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,179
very effectively

737
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,039
and have integrity across

738
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,200
representations and languages including

739
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,960
mathematics and non-mathematics but also

740
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,020
difference natural languages

741
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,039
so the ontology is how we're taking a

742
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,500
systems engineering approach to learning

743
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,600
and applying active inference

744
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,899
as this incipient ecosystem of learning

745
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,000
and application is really truly just

746
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
beginning we wanted to censor

747
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,580
accessibility and rigor from the

748
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,500
beginning and people are going to use

749
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,120
the ontology in different ways but

750
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,620
having it as a resource is already been

751
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,460
vital and for those who see this as like

752
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,659
a possible way to work as a way to

753
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,120
make

754
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,740
improvements to for example translations

755
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,539
and definitions

756
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,960
it's a big option

757
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,820
and we have a table here so that we can

758
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,380
reference it throughout because as

759
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,740
you'll see like questions use

760
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,919
where possible ontology tags

761
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,620
we're talking about minimizing surprise

762
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,260
now there still is a lot of

763
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,059
complexity around what Supply surprise

764
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,520
is but like this is a starting point

765
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,919
this is like something clickable and

766
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,840
interactable that we can always go

767
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
deeper into

768
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,919
um

769
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,539
last tables then we'll go into the

770
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,520
question section so here's the live

771
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,919
streams table

772
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,860
um or you can use the link here

773
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,140
here are the um

774
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,460
uh 200 plus live streams that we've done

775
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,700
all just highlight like live streams

776
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,220
are paper oriented so we've done 53

777
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,899
papers

778
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,059
so here you'll find a huge number of

779
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,559
relevant papers and if you could look up

780
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,059
like eco

781
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:58,879
okay here's some discussions on ecology

782
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,620
live stream are paper oriented guest

783
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,179
streams include a broad range of guests

784
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,360
in active and adjacent areas and like

785
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,980
always please feel free to suggest

786
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,019
anyone or make an introduction if you

787
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,179
want to see something highlighted model

788
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,320
streams focus on models and applications

789
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,240
of active inference like for example the

790
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,519
python implementation of Pi mdp which

791
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,260
we'll talk about

792
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,640
and then

793
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,279
um down on the bottom you'll see the par

794
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,380
pazula friston textbook and here you'll

795
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,419
see cohort ones videos so if you just

796
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,820
feel like watching cohort ones videos

797
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,480
then you can see like here's their

798
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,580
playlist

799
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,100
going through

800
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,880
um

801
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,880
and

802
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,059
here's just all the students with their

803
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,220
optional contact information so again

804
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,659
just to close the section within the

805
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,880
last 20 minutes we'll have uh anything

806
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,760
we want to ask or discuss

807
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,659
um

808
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,700
so um

809
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,360
overview provides some information on

810
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,679
active

811
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,239
textbook group

812
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,280
has information on our live meetings

813
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,659
textbook is mainly oriented around

814
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,179
focusing discussion on a given chapter

815
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,540
and on the contents of the textbook in

816
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,000
discourse we have questions ideas and

817
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,399
insights and project ideas

818
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,440
these are some places to make

819
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,540
contributions to

820
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,339
and then active inference tables just

821
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,399
hold some reference tables okay

822
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,199
I'll look at the questions in the chat

823
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,879
and then

824
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,619
um anyone who wants to raise their hand

825
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,020
or add something else in the chat okay

826
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,300
if I plan to engage asynchronously and

827
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,800
have questions on a chapter ahead of the

828
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,418
cohort 3 schedule where should I ask

829
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,260
them

830
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,320
great question so you can ask them also

831
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,460
in the questions table

832
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,080
here's cohort three questions

833
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,300
so they're all here if you have a

834
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,119
question on chapter three four five

835
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,640
just add it here

836
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,240
we'll get to it when we will get to it

837
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,800
um hope that addresses it but you don't

838
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,839
you're not limited to asking only what

839
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,000
we're going to discuss that week if you

840
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,339
have something on chapter three just add

841
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,820
it right here

842
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,280
thanks ever for asking answering it um I

843
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,660
was concerned the question would promote

844
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,640
discussion until the group made that

845
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,960
chapter

846
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,520
um it it can if it if like we're not

847
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,320
hyper only focusing on the the only the

848
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,780
text of the chapter but that is the

849
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,579
group regime of attention so it will

850
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,560
facilitate discussion when when people

851
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,540
do get there on their own time or in the

852
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,260
group

853
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,300
and you say I plan to implement some of

854
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,700
the active principles rather soon

855
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,680
by being here we are already all

856
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,980
implementing the principles and

857
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,900
anywhere that you can make your

858
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,700
contribution like we're all going to be

859
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,040
exploring and whittling away at this

860
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,060
forest in our own paths so just add it

861
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,619
and

862
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,240
it'll come into play

863
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,220
hope that addresses it um Lucas and then

864
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,900
anyone else

865
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,940
oh yeah I know you mentioned something

866
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,880
about listening to the book I did take a

867
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,020
look at it and it looks like there's a

868
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,300
lot of mathematical equations and graphs

869
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,160
like would you say that in order to have

870
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,500
the best experience it should be in a

871
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,359
physical copy to read rather than to let

872
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,420
them feel unaudible or something

873
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,820
great question few uh ways to to talk

874
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,320
about that like

875
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,839
uh

876
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,599
the audio version of the first chapter

877
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,119
was very easy introduction in the first

878
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,380
chapter which is what I made because

879
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,480
they didn't have equations

880
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,040
um

881
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,020
the natural language descriptions of the

882
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,859
equations one can imagine will be vital

883
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,020
for the audiobook

884
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,540
because one can then say Okay equation

885
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,220
2.5 and then read the equation

886
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,500
like this

887
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,280
we don't exactly have that yet and like

888
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
depending on how deeply one wants to go

889
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
into the math

890
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,660
like the zeroth level is like they just

891
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,060
put math here there are some other

892
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,980
section here

893
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,720
carrying on

894
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,220
the next level might be just like okay

895
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,140
this is about free energy

896
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,119
on some things what are those things

897
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,920
well okay you can go one level deeper

898
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,500
okay what is that function or what is

899
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,660
that functional okay one level deeper so

900
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,640
we're all like you can go down the

901
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,380
rabbit hole your whole life on two plus

902
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,480
two

903
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
and on the other side you can dance with

904
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,980
equations like this even if you don't

905
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,200
have a formal mathematical background

906
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,579
we're not

907
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,000
generating these equations were not par

908
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,800
or at all

909
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,740
we're just understanding what

910
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,859
to some extent they've put and then we

911
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,720
ask questions about like what the role

912
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,980
is of these equations and how they're

913
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,400
used and everything like that so

914
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,160
listening Maybe

915
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,440
a good experience but share your your

916
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,260
experience if if um you found listening

917
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,940
to it to be

918
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,900
like useful or found something locking

919
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,400
I'd like to find a way to articulate

920
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,020
mathematical equations audibly yeah

921
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,720
thank you like that is exactly what this

922
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,579
is about

923
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,980
and that can't be done

924
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,300
in a in even any automated way like

925
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,040
this and it's not the only way so if

926
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,599
someone has another idea about how to

927
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,880
audibolize equations that's also very

928
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,940
cool and creative but also like for

929
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,200
those who feel like they have the

930
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,660
capacity to just take a first stab

931
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,400
and you can select the text and then

932
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,140
just write like you know I'm not write a

933
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,940
comment I'm not sure

934
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,619
that's all good

935
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,140
but it's an example of how like one

936
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,579
contribution

937
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,400
can Leverage

938
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,339
people in other language communities who

939
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,900
are in different stages of learning and

940
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,320
applying

941
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,339
anyone else feel free to like raise your

942
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,540
hand

943
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,560
or just go for it

944
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,720
such small people are typing any

945
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,980
questions or thinking if they want to

946
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,960
raise their hand

947
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,940
um

948
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,740
two weeks per chapter

949
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,020
each time we have a discussion we'll

950
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,579
like go to that page

951
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,680
and we'll we'll first assess if we have

952
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,420
any questions that people like want to

953
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,900
discuss

954
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,980
and then

955
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,640
um

956
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,700
often in the first discussion or at the

957
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,859
end of the previous of the second

958
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,900
discussion of the previous section

959
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,520
we'll have kind of just like a look

960
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,880
ahead

961
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:11,820
or we look at what the section is

962
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,780
um

963
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,060
I'll give a quick

964
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,980
um overview on the structure of a

965
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,980
textbook so this could be seen at

966
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,140
chapter nodes and questions or it can be

967
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,119
seen in the table of contents

968
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,839
the book is separated into two parts

969
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,760
in the next three months in this cohort

970
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,380
three we're going to be focusing on the

971
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,160
first

972
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,140
five chapters

973
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,079
the first chapter is an overview it's

974
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,400
non-technical

975
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,099
has a lot of conceptual materials but

976
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,820
there are no equations or formalities

977
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,700
chapters two and three describe the low

978
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,619
road and the high road to active

979
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,680
inference it's a framing that we will

980
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,720
all come to know and love

981
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,800
the low road is kind of like the how

982
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,380
in terms of using the mechanics of

983
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,480
Bayesian statistics

984
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,359
and the high road is like the ultimate

985
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,359
why this is like the imperative of

986
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,740
persistence and the free energy

987
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,859
principle and the two roads meet in the

988
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:15,480
middle with octave inference which is

989
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,740
using

990
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,780
Bayesian statistics

991
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,020
to model and Implement that persistence

992
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,460
imperative from the free energy

993
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,920
principle all roads lead to octave

994
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,720
that's chapters two and three

995
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,480
chapter four having described the two

996
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,560
roads

997
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,300
to active inference

998
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,820
is the heart of active inference which

999
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,800
is about modeling

1000
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
and it's about this specific type of

1001
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
model called a generative model

1002
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,180
the generative model is like the heart

1003
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,420
or the kernel of active inference and

1004
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,619
we'll get there chapter 5 then turns to

1005
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,300
one of the areas where active inference

1006
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,460
has been most characterized and studied

1007
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,180
which is in mammalian neurobiology

1008
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,940
and chapter 5 goes through a few neural

1009
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,940
systems of mammals and talks about

1010
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,800
active inference modeling in those

1011
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,160
settings and then provides a table that

1012
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,339
has citations to many other places that

1013
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,560
active inference has been applied

1014
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,780
so that's the conceptual half of the

1015
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,500
book

1016
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,320
is overview what's the big picture

1017
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,660
what's the positioning what are we

1018
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,060
talking about with active

1019
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,640
what are the two roads to get there or

1020
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,300
what two roads meet in active

1021
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,240
what is the heart of active in terms of

1022
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,820
generative modeling and then what is one

1023
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,220
of the most critical areas that active

1024
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,079
has been applied which is mammalian

1025
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,820
neurobiology

1026
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,339
the second half which is going to be

1027
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,579
starting in a few months for this cohort

1028
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:55,260
or people can show up one hour earlier

1029
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,720
and check in with cohort 2 who's working

1030
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,579
on the second half now

1031
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,980
the second half starts

1032
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,060
with a informal recipe for Designing

1033
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,220
active inference models kind of like a

1034
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,680
step by step but it's like a process or

1035
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,980
recipe for this kind of modeling

1036
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,060
so like

1037
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm gonna be like where's the modeling

1038
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,640
where's the modeling it's like it it

1039
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,900
it's

1040
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,099
coming

1041
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,900
and it's now for people who want to do

1042
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,099
it

1043
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,140
then chapter 7 and 8 describe a few

1044
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,119
different important subtypes of

1045
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,160
generative models

1046
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,640
chapter 9 describes using data in

1047
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,140
generative modeling

1048
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,720
and chapter 10 is kind of like the

1049
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,300
opposite of chapter one or the other end

1050
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,339
of the bookshelf it's like summarizing

1051
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,040
and giving an overview

1052
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,920
there are some appendices that may be of

1053
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,540
value to you

1054
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,619
but

1055
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,720
you may dive into those as their

1056
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,380
reference in the text or no worries if

1057
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,720
uh not

1058
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,640
um

1059
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,420
so that's kind of the broad picture

1060
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,000
and the pacing that we're going to go

1061
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,180
through

1062
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
um

1063
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,579
Kate thanks for the awesome question yes

1064
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,700
if anyone has like python resources

1065
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,079
uh putting them into code or resources

1066
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,359
could be awesome here's like a bunch of

1067
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:25,920
implementations

1068
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,300
that we have

1069
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,520
and in the recent

1070
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,619
um Pi mdp stream

1071
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,980
I'll put this link in the chat

1072
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,800
this in the video description here's a

1073
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,900
Google collab notebook

1074
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,480
that doesn't need any tuning you can

1075
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,140
just run this in your browser

1076
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,400
and it is doing active inference so if

1077
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,260
you want help with understanding like

1078
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,960
the python Basics and the syntax of

1079
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,339
python

1080
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,380
um I'm sure many people can share

1081
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,740
resources about that but like this

1082
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,000
notebook

1083
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,839
is awesome for actually working through

1084
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,119
it and playing with different parameters

1085
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,400
and in the first half of the textbook

1086
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,260
we're building a lot of the conceptual

1087
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,780
and formal understanding

1088
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,200
so that when we're in the programming

1089
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,560
we'll understand what these matrices are

1090
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,480
and there isn't Just One path maybe

1091
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,140
somebody wants to just work through this

1092
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,640
and then

1093
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,859
come to the formalisms later or work on

1094
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,480
the philosophy and then come to the math

1095
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,079
it's like there's just a million paths

1096
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,760
so as long as we're in the gaming active

1097
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,960
we're making it happen

1098
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
um

1099
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:59,598
okay any other thoughts or questions

1100
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,980
okay just again raise your raise your

1101
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,500
hand or or put it in the chat

1102
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,540
um let's just do a little tiny look

1103
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,099
ahead

1104
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,359
next two weeks we're going to be

1105
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,440
discussing chapter one the preface

1106
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,599
um is written by Carl friston

1107
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,319
it's just two pages long and it includes

1108
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:29,760
this absolutely endearing confession

1109
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,160
that Carl was not allowed to it was not

1110
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,680
an affordance for Carl to write this

1111
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,119
textbook

1112
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,319
um

1113
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:40,079
those who know may be familiar that his

1114
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,760
writing style is very

1115
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,940
um erudite and

1116
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,220
so the book

1117
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,440
it was not the desired Style

1118
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,260
so that's just very nice by Carl

1119
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,540
um but the preface doesn't really

1120
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,060
um have any

1121
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,780
big um pieces chapter one is the

1122
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,579
overview

1123
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:03,960
um yes thanks for those like all

1124
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,560
different time zones coming through

1125
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,720
um hopefully like the office hours at

1126
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,300
the different time the recordings and of

1127
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,740
course like if you want to suggest

1128
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,319
another time that you could commit to it

1129
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,500
may be possible to also add that

1130
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,680
um but also

1131
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,420
the synchronous activities are totally

1132
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,680
optional

1133
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,020
and

1134
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,579
one's own reading or listening

1135
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,319
contributions

1136
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:35,040
are primarily on their own time

1137
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,800
chapter one is an overview

1138
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,200
it's introducing the main questions that

1139
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,520
active inference is going to seek to

1140
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,099
address that is the Target that they are

1141
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,460
painting for this textbook is active

1142
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,960
inference

1143
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,140
as a unified principle for mind brain

1144
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,180
and behavior

1145
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,839
um and how can organisms persist amidst

1146
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,180
environmental Exchange

1147
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,000
that question is the heart of section

1148
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,920
1.2

1149
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,319
and we see a really

1150
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,480
simplified version

1151
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,060
of an action perception Loop

1152
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,180
that we're going to be focusing on

1153
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,540
agents

1154
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,740
world

1155
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,800
generative model agent generative

1156
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,819
process World niche

1157
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,460
doesn't only apply to mammals and

1158
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,660
continents

1159
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,780
it turns out that this formalization

1160
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,680
of perception cognition

1161
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,260
action and impact

1162
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,020
is going to be immensely transferable

1163
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,220
and composable

1164
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:50,099
active inference is sometimes described

1165
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:53,040
as a first principles perspective

1166
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,240
and

1167
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,920
it'll be awesome to hear more

1168
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,079
discussions on like what people think

1169
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,280
that means

1170
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,520
but one way to think about it is like

1171
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,500
this is kind of a first principles

1172
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,540
approach

1173
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,960
in terms of a how with base statistics

1174
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,819
and this is like a first principles why

1175
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:16,940
in terms of persistence as an imperative

1176
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,220
there's the introduction of two

1177
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,040
attitudes towards science neats and

1178
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,240
scruffies

1179
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,180
needs are seeking unification

1180
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,060
scruffies embrace heterogeneity

1181
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,720
and so do we want to have a unique

1182
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,400
biological model let's have a journal

1183
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,339
for every synapse let's have a a

1184
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,200
different University for every single

1185
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,020
follicle like at some point

1186
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,060
we have

1187
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,859
um composition

1188
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:50,180
and harmonization not homogeneous

1189
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,400
homogenization of the diversity of

1190
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,599
biology

1191
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,619
and so that neat scruffy dialectic

1192
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,319
guides a lot of these discussions about

1193
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,300
particulars in generals

1194
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,460
the structure of the book

1195
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,980
there's two parts to the book

1196
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,720
these are aimed at readers who want to

1197
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,280
understand active inference first part

1198
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,599
that's us

1199
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,700
and those who seek to use it for their

1200
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,440
own research second part also that is us

1201
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,780
we will get through both

1202
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,000
the first part is going to introduce it

1203
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,280
conceptually and formally

1204
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,839
it's going to refer to some other

1205
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,660
alternate theories of cognition

1206
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,339
and so just to

1207
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:33,119
um

1208
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,460
plant the seed when people are asking

1209
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,760
questions or even skepticisms or

1210
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,800
critiques of active inference you can

1211
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,740
ask yourself or them is this like a

1212
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,619
critique of modeling in general like

1213
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,680
would any usage of any model fall victim

1214
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,359
to that criticism

1215
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,920
which doesn't mean it's not valid it

1216
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,660
just means that it's like in immensely

1217
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,520
far-ranging critique

1218
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,059
or is there a unique critique that is

1219
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,040
being made of what we're actually

1220
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,020
learning here

1221
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,599
and it's not always immediately clear

1222
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,700
the goal the first part is to provide a

1223
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,920
comprehensive formal and self-contained

1224
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,660
introduction to active inference its

1225
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,160
main constructs and implications for the

1226
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,079
study of brain and cognition

1227
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,800
well we'll see if it is comprehensive

1228
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,140
formal and self-contained

1229
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,619
and where we have questions we can ask

1230
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,619
where we want to add we can add

1231
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,839
it's just the first version of the first

1232
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,099
textbook

1233
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:33,780
that's been in the niche for eight

1234
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,740
months

1235
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,740
and we can be part of that feedback loop

1236
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,540
and make it happen

1237
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,760
part one active inference in theory

1238
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,280
that's the first five chapters this is

1239
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,940
going to give some overviews on like key

1240
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,619
terms that are going to come into play

1241
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,720
why are we talking about surprise why

1242
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,220
are we talking about adaptive control

1243
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,140
why are we talking about the action

1244
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,040
perception Loop

1245
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,540
here's that figure the two roads to

1246
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,819
active inference High Road starting on

1247
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,740
the top right free energy principle

1248
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,480
Road starting on the bottom left base

1249
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,960
theorem

1250
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,400
description of the high road and low

1251
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,260
road which are going to be chapters two

1252
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,099
and three

1253
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,079
chapters two and three

1254
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:24,680
chapter two low road chapter 3 High Road

1255
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,700
chapter four

1256
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,520
active inference formally that's where

1257
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,540
we're going to get to the generative

1258
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,599
model what is the generative model

1259
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,540
what is generative modeling that is the

1260
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,059
heart of active inference like the

1261
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,119
linear model is at the heart of linear

1262
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,119
modeling and the generative model is

1263
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,740
going to be at the heart of active

1264
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,619
inference modeling

1265
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:53,160
and then chapter 5 is going to move from

1266
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,579
the generative model in the abstract to

1267
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,680
a setting where generative models have

1268
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,819
been applied

1269
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:03,359
at this point the most densely in

1270
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,579
literature which is mammalian

1271
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:08,420
neuroscience

1272
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,500
here are some of the key differences

1273
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,079
between active and Alternate Frameworks

1274
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,079
the unity of perception and action in

1275
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,000
terms of a shared imperative to minimize

1276
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,460
free energy

1277
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,460
the accommodation of planning and policy

1278
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,660
selection

1279
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,339
censoring sensory data

1280
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,500
diverse cognitive operations attention

1281
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,460
memory anticipation

1282
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,540
conceptualized as inference over

1283
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,059
generative models

1284
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,859
consistent with the Bayesian brain

1285
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,319
hypothesis

1286
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,240
perception and learning as active

1287
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,899
processes

1288
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,180
action as goal oriented

1289
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,559
which has many deep roots in cybernetics

1290
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,220
and the biological plausibility

1291
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,280
of different constructs

1292
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,920
part two active inference in practice

1293
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,480
check out that but we're not going to

1294
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,359
focus on it immediately

1295
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,819
and 1.5

1296
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:14,579
this chapter is just summarizing the

1297
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,680
first half of this book

1298
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,119
and the second half

1299
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,520
previewing the perspective that will be

1300
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,440
unpacked

1301
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,079
the books divided into two parts

1302
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,240
understand and use

1303
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:31,440
they hope it will persuade readers that

1304
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,000
active inference offers not only a

1305
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,500
unifying principle

1306
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,300
under which to understand Behavior but

1307
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,040
also a tractable approach to studying

1308
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,660
action and perception in autonomous

1309
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,040
systems

1310
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,359
so

1311
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:46,400
it's about 14 pages long

1312
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,680
we have two weeks to discuss it

1313
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,180
so we'll be able to surface many

1314
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,559
Reflections and sensitivities that

1315
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,300
people are having

1316
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,680
two

1317
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,260
chapter one

1318
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,819
that

1319
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:06,380
concludes our first meeting

1320
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,819
following this meeting the recording

1321
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,400
will be posted in like as a unlisted

1322
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,319
YouTube video here

1323
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:15,540
and um

1324
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,700
actually immediately following this

1325
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,540
meeting

1326
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,059
over in the Discord

1327
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:24,480
uh which I'll copy the link in we're

1328
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,619
just gonna

1329
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:28,020
hang out and just have education open

1330
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,579
hours so it's gonna it's kind of

1331
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:31,079
convenient

1332
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,640
um if you want to continue just the

1333
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,440
discussion on the textbook or learning

1334
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,500
or education so

1335
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,619
thank you all for joining

1336
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:43,740
I will close the recording and looking

1337
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,720
forward to seeing you next week

1338
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,900
thank you bye
