1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,819
hello it's February 22nd 2023 we're in

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,519
meeting five

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,440
four cohort three

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,719
we're in our second discussion on

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,559
chapter two

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,640
today we'll be mostly looking at

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,920
questions from chapter two carrying

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,560
people's like thoughts on it

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,900
written or whatever they want to bring

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,240
up today and then in the last few

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,220
minutes we'll look ahead to chapter

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,140
three

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,320
first though wanted to note underneath

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,940
live meetings

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,780
on February 27th in five days we will

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,379
have Thomas Parr join for a live stream

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,180
first author so it's at 17 UTC

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,160
um for likely an hour

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800
if anybody wants to join the live stream

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,300
itself

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,079
then just email activeinference Gmail

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,660
and let us know and we'll add you to the

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,219
calendar event

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,099
if you want to watch along live here's

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,659
the or share it and this is like the

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,780
watch and the re-watch link

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,460
and then if you have any specific

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,960
questions

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,420
it could be something that we've already

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,799
raised

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,060
or it could be something more General

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,320
slash personal

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,280
so just before we jump to chapter two

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,500
what does anyone think would be

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,840
interesting or meaningful to ask Thomas

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,259
feel free to think about it or type it

37
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,900
um here but basically when

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,780
the day comes it's going to be whoever

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,899
has um thank you Jonathan it's going to

40
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,420
be whoever is there in the moment

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,520
so just email if you want to join on

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,079
that stream

43
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,020
and whichever questions are here

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,140
slash questions that we've just curated

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,360
and then if there's time or if anyone is

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,220
watching live they can put a question in

47
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,200
the live chat too

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,180
so

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,739
um

50
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,680
we'll continue to explore like what

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,160
kinds of engagements with Thomas Gianni

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
and Carl

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,780
are best for the book and everything but

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,099
this is going to be a lot of fun

55
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,299
okay

56
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,280
well we have many chapter two questions

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
does anyone have a specific one they

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,180
wanna

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,180
jump into first or just any

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,099
chapter two

61
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,260
reflection or a comment that they want

62
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,019
to share there's totally time to do that

63
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,620
if you want to

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,599
foreign

65
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,640
[Music]

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,720
comments and questions

67
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,340
kind of just drawing

68
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,920
draw from the question posterior

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,019
how does active inference go beyond the

70
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,580
recognition that action and perception

71
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,500
have the same inferential nature

72
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,619
page 24.

73
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,260
what do people think so

74
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,940
this is probably referring to section

75
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,920
2.4

76
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
um how do we go beyond

77
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,739
recognizing well

78
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,400
maybe perception and learning have a

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,860
similar inferential nature maybe we can

80
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,680
have a unified framework that models

81
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,379
perception and action together and maybe

82
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,840
they even have a unified imperative

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,540
I think the simplest answer is they're

84
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,500
different parameters

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
that's how we move past that recognition

86
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,220
they're modeled as different parameters

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,020
in a unified model

88
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,940
so you want to add another thought or

89
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,259
question on that

90
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,440
foreign

91
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,320
specific question to go to otherwise we

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,479
have many that we can

93
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,020
come to

94
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,620
okay

95
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,199
why Express

96
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,360
potential energy and expected free

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,000
energy in the space of log probabilities

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,660
on page 33. consistent with the notion

99
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,639
of potential energy and physics expected

100
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,620
free energy is expressed in the space of

101
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,639
log probabilities

102
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,639
nice question any first thoughts let's

103
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,100
look at where it was

104
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,940
in the textbook

105
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,880
so we're talking about taking the

106
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,919
expected free energy of each policy

107
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,080
so equation 2.6

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,039
expected free energy over policies

109
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,759
that's sharpening our action prior our

110
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,639
habits into the action posterior that

111
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,780
we're actually going to sample our

112
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,440
actions from

113
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,139
does anyone want to give a thought on

114
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,900
that question

115
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,020
yeah so um

116
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,340
in one of my maths modules we're

117
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,400
currently studying Bayesian maths and um

118
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,780
one of the benefits of using

119
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,479
probabilities is to make it easier to

120
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,460
calculate derivatives when you're

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,039
modeling gaussians and a second point

122
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,740
was like computational benefit you might

123
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,259
encounter floating Point errors when

124
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,180
dealing with I think marginal evidence

125
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,520
which can be very small for some values

126
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,900
so calculating the log version of those

127
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,960
um reduces the likelihood of getting

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,819
encountering inflation Point issues and

129
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,080
precision errors that's what I'm trying

130
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,318
to say

131
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,600
awesome thank you

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,419
yeah the log is something that's like

133
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,880
very simple whether it's like log base 2

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,880
or Ln the natural log

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,039
it it does a lot and it also has one

136
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,300
foot

137
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,139
in the kind of computational

138
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,000
tractability benefits

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,979
like being able to keep track of small

140
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,199
probabilities like if you have a hundred

141
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,120
options that most of them are going to

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,919
be small like less than one percent now

143
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
if you have a thousand options most of

144
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,620
them are going to be small like on

145
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,660
average less than a tenth of a percent

146
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,020
so as you get many options or

147
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,419
probability distributions you want to be

148
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,979
able to keep track with high resolution

149
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,800
of these very small numbers on real

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
computers so it helps purely

151
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,259
pragmatically in

152
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,020
the kinds of computers we have today

153
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,780
then a little bit more mathematically

154
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,340
the log connects to Jensen's inequality

155
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,039
and also to um

156
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,639
information Theory and self-suprisal

157
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,039
and then something that's unpacked a lot

158
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,560
more in Bayesian physics and less in

159
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,840
this textbook itself

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,380
is like physics uses kind of like

161
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,979
gravity as like a self-information

162
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,919
not exactly you know read where it's

163
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,080
actually connected

164
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,060
but it turns out that like the ball

165
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,340
rolling to the bottom of the hill to

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,860
minimize the potential energy

167
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,979
has a lot to do with the quote ball

168
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,620
rolling to the bottom of the hill of a

169
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,319
statistical distribution if we think

170
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,860
about self-surprise self-information

171
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,560
in a log probability space Ollie

172
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,020
yes and uh one more advantage of using a

173
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,160
lot of probabilities is uh to order uh

174
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,040
more generally to use logs instead of

175
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,880
the actual parameters is

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,620
um to convert some of the

177
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,880
multiplications to addition and hence uh

178
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,180
trying to convert at least parts of the

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,279
non-linearities of the equations to

180
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,459
linear equations so

181
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:12,779
in that case well of course we know

182
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,740
dealing with linear equations

183
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,519
is much more tractable and also much

184
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,180
more

185
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,540
[Applause]

186
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,680
I mean linear techniques has much more

187
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,959
developed than just dealing with

188
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,500
directly with nonlinear equations and

189
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,899
nonlinear capillations

190
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,360
thanks yeah two of the log properties

191
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,399
that come into play a lot

192
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,620
and you can go back and forth like

193
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,779
they're used in both directions

194
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,160
here log of M times m so log of 5 times

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
10 log of 50. equals log of 5 plus log

196
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,240
of 10. so you can break multiplication

197
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,279
inside of the parentheses you can break

198
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,959
it into two Logs with the same a value

199
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,779
and analogously if you have like log M

200
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,620
minus log n it's the same as log of

201
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,320
M divided by n

202
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,680
and these kinds of Maneuvers and

203
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
rewritings

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,399
are used greatly

205
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,060
and it turns out that the KL Divergence

206
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,940
which is one Divergence measure that's

207
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,980
used so just like you'll know that

208
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,200
you're doing you're doing better in the

209
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
least

210
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,500
um squares sum of squares linear

211
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,480
regression world you know that you're

212
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,060
doing better when the sum of squares is

213
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,560
going down

214
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
in the KL Divergence World variational

215
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
inference World your model is getting

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
better fit when the KL Divergence is

217
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,980
going down

218
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,040
again there's more detail but these all

219
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,480
are empowered by the ability to

220
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,120
have something within a log

221
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,040
that's multiplied

222
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,959
which also gives this the interpretation

223
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,240
as like potentially a self-suprisal

224
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
self-information

225
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,839
and then separate that out and do

226
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,200
addition

227
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,800
so it has computational benefits

228
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,500
it has statistical benefits and it has

229
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,160
also a deeper connection to Bayesian

230
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
physics

231
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,079
foreign

232
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,360
okay Ollie go for it

233
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,700
uh sorry before going into the next

234
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,600
question I just wanted to comment on the

235
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,279
previous question the question number

236
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,640
two uh sorry I erased my hand a little

237
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,880
bit uh later so uh you didn't notice but

238
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
uh yeah about the relation between the

239
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,720
perception and action uh so very briefly

240
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
uh Alan bertho's

241
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,600
um actually proposes that uh perception

242
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
is uh simulated action so it basically

243
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,519
implies that perception and motion are

244
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,620
kind of

245
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,680
irreducibly interconnected and actually

246
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,800
he also claims that the former I mean

247
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,079
the perception defines the action so

248
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,820
yeah it's uh also uh another Viewpoint

249
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,640
which is uh way before uh the

250
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,339
development of active inference and

251
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,459
um pre-energy principle but these ideas

252
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,200
of the interconnection between the

253
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,060
action and perception uh has been uh

254
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,700
discussed uh all I mean throughout the

255
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,860
history of cognitive science and

256
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,160
especially uh the last few decades in

257
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
terms of embodied cognition and so on

258
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,700
but in my view Alan berthoud's uh Claim

259
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,040
about this specific interconnection

260
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,899
between perception and action and

261
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,100
basically uh making them equivalent uh

262
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,779
in to each other uh in terms of their

263
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,839
um one of which being the simulation of

264
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,839
the other is an interesting Viewpoint to

265
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,959
have in mind beyond the inferential

266
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,579
nature of them

267
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,120
nice yeah like even qualitatively

268
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,820
we can draw connections with different

269
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,420
threads like helmholtz perception is

270
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,500
unconscious inference okay now just save

271
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,700
that thank you for the thing okay now

272
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,040
what's the pragmatic turn

273
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,740
well that's about in the Bayesian brain

274
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,200
it's about thinking about action

275
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,820
alongside inference so it's like okay we

276
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,860
have helmholtz perception is unconscious

277
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,820
inference

278
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,220
now let's extend that to action and

279
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,060
perception as unconscious inference

280
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,519
that's still a qualitative idea

281
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,300
and octave and fep are helping us

282
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,459
develop quantitative methods

283
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,620
that

284
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,380
are compatible

285
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,899
with with those kind of qualitative ways

286
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,519
of thinking about perception cognition

287
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,040
and action

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,980
okay upper bound I think we came to last

289
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,240
week so

290
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
what is meant by bounded computational

291
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
and mnemonic resources

292
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,820
anyone have a thought on this or related

293
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,300
idea

294
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,760
I think this is great

295
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,040
answer just

296
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,300
you can write an equation you know 10 to

297
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,160
the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to

298
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,079
the 10 to the 10th power

299
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,820
but just because you can write it on a

300
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,959
piece of paper doesn't mean that there's

301
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,480
like a calculator that has that much RAM

302
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
am I just you know the number of digits

303
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,660
that you need to store might be outside

304
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,740
of

305
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,660
the heat capacity of Earth or something

306
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,240
like that so

307
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,839
we want to be able to express models in

308
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,880
an open-ended way

309
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,279
in principle

310
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,139
also

311
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,899
especially if we're talking about what

312
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,019
kind of inference is optimal

313
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,660
it's important to take this probably

314
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,060
approximately correct

315
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,180
approximate Bayesian computation

316
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,579
heuristics

317
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,959
angle

318
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,420
that respects the actual

319
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,880
time space

320
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,639
trade-offs that are

321
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,420
fundamental for any actual

322
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,920
system

323
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
and any model that we make of a given

324
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,099
system

325
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,699
like

326
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,040
it's not behaving accurately and you

327
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,940
know

328
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,820
if it remembered every single Pixel

329
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,740
it's like well yeah but there's not

330
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,600
enough space for it to remember every

331
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
pixel so it might be doing something

332
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,139
that's actually very adaptive involving

333
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,660
forgetting the vast majority of

334
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,820
information

335
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,800
and there's there's no trade-off there

336
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,720
but if we can only state the models in

337
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,860
principle

338
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,000
and we don't keep it bounded with the um

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,180
limitations of real systems

340
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,579
and the approximate Bayesian computation

341
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:45,959
framework then

342
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,040
you know

343
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,759
maybe the scripts don't run because and

344
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,019
and that's also really yeah there's

345
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,940
other angles there any thoughts or

346
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,440
comments on this or this is a good

347
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
answer

348
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
also kind of a nice

349
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,819
link to

350
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,260
um mnemonic resources

351
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,780
like Memory Palace

352
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,819
like what if you didn't have to remember

353
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,400
every single word in the poem but you

354
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,500
remembered some nested model

355
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,240
where the higher part of the nested

356
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400
model involved

357
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,579
touching parts of the environment or

358
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,179
walking through an imagined space

359
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,340
are the cognitive

360
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,320
constraints or challenges associated

361
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,419
with those types of mnemonic resources

362
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,980
that cue

363
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,799
one's action

364
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,799
does that have some properties that are

365
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,179
beneficial

366
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,400
relative to kind of like

367
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,480
the naked memory

368
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,240
how does active inference

369
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,480
incorporate feelings into the framework

370
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,000
theory in the Apple frog example when

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,919
the human believes she is confronted

372
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,600
with an apple before the observation is

373
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,340
she feeling hungry or low on glucose

374
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,740
when she subsequently observes the thing

375
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,080
jump does that observation include the

376
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,700
feeling of disappointment the release of

377
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,640
stress hormones Etc

378
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,679
what would anyone say on this

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,240
Jonathan and then anyone else

380
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,220
yeah so I I wrote the the thing below

381
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,720
that that I I think that there's a

382
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,340
strong relationship there between

383
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,860
feelings and observations

384
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,419
um in the in the sense that we observe

385
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,340
our bodily States but I think this ties

386
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,100
in nicely with um some of Mark Sultan's

387
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,280
um work on on affect and Consciousness

388
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,179
um

389
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,760
yeah so I think that yeah one once you

390
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,100
think about bodily States and the

391
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,080
inferences we make about the state that

392
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,380
we're in based on those observations

393
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,179
nice thank you anyone else

394
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,340
I would put this in the county oh yeah

395
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,700
I'll leave first go for it

396
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,860
uh yeah I just wanted to point out that

397
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,919
there's actually a theory of emotions or

398
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,860
feelings developed with inactive uh

399
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,380
active inference framework and we deeply

400
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,120
felt affect uh Theory uh developed by uh

401
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,960
Casper hesp and Ryan Smith and others uh

402
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,480
so uh

403
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,120
if anyone's interested in exploring how

404
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,200
active how we can theoretically frame

405
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
feelings uh purely in terms of active

406
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
imprints I would highly recommend

407
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,080
reading this fascinating paper

408
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,780
from I guess to 2020.

409
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,039
yes thank you

410
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,280
I would put it in the category of

411
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,520
possible to model like you could make a

412
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,080
model about it you could write a paper

413
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,400
about it

414
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,640
but not intrinsic Within

415
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,460
the simplest kernel

416
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,580
because feelings also as Psalms will

417
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,140
um be

418
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,980
um

419
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,039
Keen to point out feelings implies a

420
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,120
feeler

421
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,140
and so that is bringing in the qualia

422
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,960
phenomenology experience awareness

423
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,340
topic

424
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,220
but the model can also be stated

425
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,260
without those

426
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,980
considerations playing an outsized role

427
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,840
but if someone's making a map like a

428
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,340
generative model

429
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,179
and they want to include those variables

430
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,039
there are some strategies that people

431
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,580
have been implementing for years

432
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,700
to engage with affective States

433
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,000
in a computational psychiatry

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,640
approach

435
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,640
like and just an empirical strategy

436
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,799
might be like we start with a simple

437
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,820
model

438
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,559
and then we find oh there's like this

439
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,080
interesting residual pattern where

440
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,940
people are

441
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,419
um overestimating How likely apples are

442
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,179
around noon

443
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,039
and then we get a new sensor in our

444
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,780
laboratory now we're measuring glucose

445
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,559
or we um are getting some Health Data so

446
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,299
now we can differentiate people who have

447
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,820
this metabolic condition from that and

448
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,020
we're finding that they have a different

449
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,480
inference strategy

450
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,360
so it's not about just sketching it and

451
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,860
just saying oh it's a done deal because

452
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,159
it's on paper it's about that iterative

453
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,679
modeling

454
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,780
and a plurality of possible ways that

455
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,400
feelings

456
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,100
could be implemented

457
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,539
though I think Psalms and others will

458
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,159
say that they have

459
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,460
um in silico

460
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,400
feeling agents

461
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
so that again opens up a whole other

462
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,460
level of discussion

463
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,000
all right

464
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,380
when quantifying dissimilarity between

465
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,240
the prior and posterior

466
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,900
so for example Bayesian surprise so

467
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,100
surprise alone just surprisal

468
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,440
is about one data point coming in how

469
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,059
surprised are we

470
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,820
measured in information theoretic units

471
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,880
like a not or a bit

472
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,260
but if we're talking about Bayesian

473
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,419
surprise we're talking about how much

474
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:47,520
the prior shifts to become the posterior

475
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,140
as a function of the observation coming

476
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,600
in why do we choose the KL Divergence

477
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,918
over other measures

478
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,480
is it just a canonical Choice does it

479
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,900
matter since KL Divergence is asymmetric

480
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,640
is there any reason we have chosen this

481
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,380
particular order is there any intuition

482
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,120
motivating the choice does anyone want

483
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,379
to give a first thought

484
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,179
okay one example of an alternative

485
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,780
measure here's with um Sajid

486
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,440
at all

487
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,900
foreign

488
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,760
this is getting

489
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,360
um

490
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,200
kind of as far as we might want to visit

491
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
it here but

492
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,440
it's important that the kale diversions

493
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,620
as the questioner notes it's not

494
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,320
actually a measure

495
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,000
in the proper

496
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,539
metric sense and I mean like European

497
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,460
metric system

498
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,880
like if it the measurement between A and

499
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,679
B has to be the same between b and a for

500
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,260
it to be a distance measure

501
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,080
um whereas the KL Divergence it is a

502
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,860
quantitative value but the Divergence

503
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,460
from A to B is not necessarily B to a in

504
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,100
fact it's generally not so

505
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,440
KL Divergence is an asymmetric

506
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,260
Divergence quantification

507
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,720
now it's possible to have a very closely

508
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,299
related Divergence called the Jeffries

509
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,140
which is just the KL Plus

510
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,039
the other direction

511
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
so it calculates like it's basically the

512
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,860
KL of a to B plus the KL of B to a and

513
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,520
so that is symmetric hence that is a

514
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,980
real distance measure

515
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,640
um other measures have been proposed the

516
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,720
rainy

517
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,000
and they may discuss other options as

518
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,039
well

519
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,360
um why is it used

520
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,740
in the context of variational Bayesian

521
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,679
inference and probability it just turns

522
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,720
out that the log properties work and um

523
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,620
in

524
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,659
equate one of the earlier equations

525
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,640
which maybe Ali will remember

526
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,700
specifically like

527
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,500
a illegal for it and I'll think about

528
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,419
which equation is the one with the KL

529
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,659
definition

530
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,080
uh it was equation 2.3 and uh yeah uh

531
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,880
but also uh there is a Lemma called

532
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,320
neyman Pearson Lemma which actually

533
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,100
proves that the most efficient way to

534
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,380
distinguish between two probability

535
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,200
distribution based on a given

536
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,700
observation is a KL Divergence so it's

537
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,880
not just an arbitrary choice but I

538
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,380
believe it's a proven theorem uh I mean

539
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,020
it's the most efficient method for

540
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,820
comparing those two probability

541
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,539
distributions

542
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,860
thank you

543
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,520
also just to kind of give one one

544
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,860
related angle to connect like why this

545
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,840
whole discussion matters for those who

546
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,980
saw that

547
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,100
as in the weeds it definitely is

548
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,500
um the way that that

549
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,020
um pragmatic value

550
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,179
is going to be determined

551
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,120
is ultimately through something kale is

552
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,880
used for information and on the

553
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,380
pragmatic side

554
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,600
but this is how when we talk about

555
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,640
expectation and preference

556
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,100
and we want to evaluate policies based

557
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,919
upon how well they align with our

558
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,020
preferences

559
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,200
that is going to be operationalized by

560
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,080
reducing a KL Divergence

561
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,658
between our preferences and observations

562
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,039
and that

563
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,460
task of optimization

564
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,919
of the incremental reduction of

565
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,799
Divergence relative to our generative

566
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:29,940
model of incoming observations

567
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,240
that's what we want to solve and it also

568
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,919
turns out to have some good

569
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,360
computational properties

570
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,919
so

571
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,380
Jonathan

572
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,820
yeah I was just going to say just in

573
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,200
terms of the

574
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,299
um the equation that sorry excuse me for

575
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,400
the expected free energy

576
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,340
um I although I I feel very comfortable

577
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,260
in general with with mathematics and

578
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,460
physics

579
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,380
um I I find it very hard to get

580
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,000
intuition from that equation I think it

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,559
would be useful maybe it's something

582
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,059
that I'm going to do but to actually run

583
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,159
through a sort of really concrete

584
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,620
example at that stage you know with

585
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,200
numbers so you can see how the two terms

586
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,820
differ for a particular example I think

587
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,039
that would be quite enlightening for for

588
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,919
me to to go through at some stage

589
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,779
thanks I know

590
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,900
some may have notebooks that do that we

591
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,220
have so however people want to share

592
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,760
that or build that that sounds good

593
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,879
um

594
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,140
many ways to go like

595
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,279
but great questions

596
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,039
thank you for who's sharing these

597
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,240
so KL plays nicely with logs

598
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,419
in in the sense that it's defined

599
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,059
essentially in terms of

600
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,799
um the the Divergence between Q to p

601
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,900
again not the distance between q and P

602
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,020
the Divergence between Q to p

603
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,320
is defined as triangle equals

604
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,140
expectation over the variational

605
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,020
Distribution on hidden States so over

606
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,860
the map not over the territory

607
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,480
expectations over the map so the center

608
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,059
of gravity

609
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:26,120
of our Maps inference on hidden States

610
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,980
of the difference

611
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,539
between

612
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,460
the log

613
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,740
Q of X and P of x

614
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,980
the log again connects us to all of

615
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,200
those nice mathematical computational

616
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,779
statistical properties of logs

617
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,460
and

618
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,419
um

619
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,520
has this Divergence interpretation to

620
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,140
expectation of a difference of logs is a

621
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,899
KL Divergence

622
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,480
and the reason why it's not symmetric is

623
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,159
because

624
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,299
um

625
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,279
P to Q

626
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,020
would be flipped and so it'd be a

627
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,980
different number

628
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,720
unless they were literally both zero

629
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,440
okay

630
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,539
under some conditions one can reduce

631
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:31,200
variational free energy to other Notions

632
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,399
which conditions

633
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,200
here they're showing it for expected

634
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,520
free energy

635
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,140
these kinds of special reduction

636
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,760
conditions

637
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,640
or special cases

638
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,620
and something analogous can be

639
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,580
um kind of

640
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,679
proposed for variational free energy

641
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,140
it's just not directly shown there

642
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,460
so

643
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,179
um

644
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,419
coming from so in variational free

645
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,020
energy F Q and Y

646
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,940
expected free energy

647
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,480
epistemic value pragmatic value in the

648
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,799
special cases are when for example

649
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,779
pragmatic value which here is shown as

650
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,940
the first term

651
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,340
and then here epistemic value is the

652
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,600
second term

653
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,039
so where

654
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,640
section one is zero this term is just

655
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,840
zeroed out

656
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,700
there's no preferences

657
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,700
preferences are flat all outcomes are

658
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,640
equally pragmatically valuable

659
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,200
then

660
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,600
we only have elements two three four

661
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,340
five and play

662
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,240
that is equivalent to Bayesian surprise

663
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,340
novelty search

664
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,799
optimal Information Gain

665
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,440
in contrast if we had discarded two two

666
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,020
three four five because it's a fully

667
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,880
discovered fully known situation there's

668
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,700
no epistemic value to harvest

669
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,059
then we only have

670
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,260
the left term one which is

671
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,580
classical pragmatic decision Theory

672
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,480
and so on

673
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,520
by acting on the World to Change the way

674
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,658
in which data are generated

675
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,100
we can ensure model is fit for purpose

676
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,600
by choosing those data which are least

677
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
surprising under our model

678
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,460
is active inference the process that can

679
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,380
explain treatment resistance

680
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,880
I can kind of imagine what that is but

681
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,260
if somebody who wrote that wants to

682
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,940
describe like what treatment resistance

683
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,240
is

684
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,659
okay under just this first pass

685
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:23,159
understanding that

686
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:24,899
um treatment resistance

687
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,600
let's just copy this information in

688
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,480
has to do with um recalcitrance or

689
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,980
resilience

690
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,080
to a given therapeutic intervention

691
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,880
there might be different ways to frame

692
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,600
it

693
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,380
but um if there's a model with a low

694
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,299
learning rate

695
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,240
I am the kind of person who does this

696
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,460
action

697
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,760
then from the clinician's perspective

698
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,279
various interventions

699
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:00,059
might be characterized the person may be

700
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,320
characterized as resistant to those

701
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,960
interventions because the interventions

702
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,179
are not updating

703
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:10,879
some aspect of their generative model

704
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,540
so

705
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,280
is it the process can explain treatment

706
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,960
resistance well again that's like asking

707
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,000
is linear regression the process that

708
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
can explain the relationship between

709
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,780
heart disease and cancer it's like

710
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,239
I don't know if you write the paper and

711
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,460
the community of experts use it then

712
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,280
it's a going scientific explanation

713
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,139
is just putting these words down the

714
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,119
explanation no

715
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,300
what else needs to be built how can that

716
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,418
question be modeled and engaged with but

717
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,940
does the framework itself simply explain

718
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,540
it no could you explain it and attempt

719
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,580
to build a model that provides unique

720
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,560
Expeditions predictions and control

721
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,359
options I believe so

722
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,500
any comments or questions on this

723
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,560
okay can someone read Bay's rule for me

724
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,619
once again in plain English equation 2.1

725
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,380
now taking into consideration that quote

726
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,320
Bayesian inference minimizes surprisal

727
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,520
surprise

728
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,560
is equivalent to maximizing Bayesian

729
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
model evidence

730
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,700
and then they're suggesting that this is

731
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,078
Computing the posterior

732
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,220
any thought on this

733
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,919
equation 2.1

734
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,859
maybe if anyone wants to

735
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:20,040
type it out in the coming weeks just I I

736
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,079
I'm not 100 sure

737
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,700
but

738
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,520
if you have the model that's

739
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,700
parameterized tuned such that Bayesian

740
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,160
model evidence is maximized

741
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,800
you have found the most likely parameter

742
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,140
the maximum likelihood estimate

743
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,619
for a given sequences of actions given

744
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:41,820
your priors

745
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,820
so you have the the most

746
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,300
supported model

747
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,760
that is equivalent to saying that with

748
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,680
your most supported model

749
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,779
you've minimized your surprise

750
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,200
so how you read different terms and like

751
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
which one you see as kind of upstream or

752
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,920
feeding into the other one

753
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,500
depends on the structure of what your

754
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,700
experiment actually is

755
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,919
okay

756
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,940
um page 24 it then generates an action

757
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,980
sends it to the environment in an

758
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,119
attempt to make the environment less

759
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,280
surprising could this be translated to a

760
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,320
clinical scenario as follows one I

761
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,599
predict bodily Integrity two I receive

762
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,420
sensory observations disconfirming my

763
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,880
prediction three I generate an action

764
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,619
undergoing treatment to receive sensory

765
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,420
observations that confirm my prediction

766
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,940
of bodily Integrity thereby making my

767
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,800
environment less surprising AKA active

768
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,119
inference

769
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,560
anyone have a thought on that

770
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,619
for qualitative active sounds good let's

771
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,440
just contrast that with other stories

772
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,540
that people could tell

773
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,320
one would be the reward learning story

774
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,380
um I'm rewarded by bodily integrity

775
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,680
I seek out actions that increase my

776
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,619
reward so I decided to go undergo

777
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,940
treatment to increase my reward

778
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,380
active

779
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,079
generative model made a prediction

780
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,859
then based upon sensory observations

781
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,140
policies were selection selected

782
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,440
to reduce surprise there's some

783
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,880
interplay of change your mind and change

784
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,079
the world

785
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,320
the other Story three this is 3A

786
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,780
and then 3B

787
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,460
is

788
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,079
I got the sensory observation

789
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,280
disconfiring my prediction

790
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,720
I updated my prior

791
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,480
now expect

792
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,920
low bodily integrity

793
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,940
issue solved

794
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,720
so

795
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,119
normative in how we describe statistical

796
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,339
problems sure

797
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,099
normative in terms of in the human

798
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,780
clinical environment

799
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,420
suggesting how to act

800
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,859
certainly not

801
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:35,540
but great start

802
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,420
policies associated with lower expected

803
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,740
free energy G

804
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,079
are assigned a higher probability and

805
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,700
become the policies that an organism

806
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,560
expects to pursue

807
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,180
is this a reason why in a therapeutic

808
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,800
setting change is often so hard to

809
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,180
achieve

810
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,280
because the person often has to select

811
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,380
different policies than they normally do

812
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,060
and these new policies are therefore

813
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,740
assigned lower probability

814
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,839
great question any thought

815
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,099
G

816
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,560
updates the policy prior

817
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,700
so we can look at we're going to come to

818
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,500
this more in chapter five when we start

819
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,940
talking thanks Jay

820
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,280
we're going to talk about it more

821
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,320
um in chapter five

822
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,800
there was a physical human

823
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,619
in case that didn't make any sense

824
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:38,640
um

825
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,480
we're going to talk about it more in

826
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,099
five

827
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,859
e is the Paul it can be seen as the

828
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,320
policy prior it's

829
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,720
the list of affordances that are

830
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,859
possible

831
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,320
and the number in each of those cells is

832
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,599
How likely those

833
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,500
um are to occur a priori so I turn right

834
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,839
60 of the time I turn left 40 of the

835
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,820
time a priori

836
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,920
if nothing else intervenes I'm going to

837
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,720
continue to replicate that 60 40

838
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,900
behavioral pattern

839
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,140
expected free energy evaluation

840
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,980
sharpens that policy prior into a policy

841
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,900
posterior

842
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,119
that better reflects

843
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,880
expected free energy minimization

844
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,099
as we just discussed which can be

845
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,960
decomposed into the epistemic and

846
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,640
pragmatic value

847
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,118
so

848
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,060
various ways of thinking about it but

849
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,839
certainly in certain settings

850
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,020
if one has a strong habit they have a

851
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,180
precise prior on action

852
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,800
then yes it would be hard to update

853
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,099
because they have a precise prior

854
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,119
on action

855
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,560
but in the end it would come down to the

856
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,140
specific model that you actually make of

857
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,839
that therapeutic setting but again just

858
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,540
qualitatively conversationally

859
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,980
that broadly makes sense

860
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,960
especially if there's a new policy

861
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,760
introduced

862
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,099
one can imagine that it has a low prior

863
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,200
because empirically it's never been seen

864
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,820
like how can one be the kind of person

865
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,260
who runs every day if they haven't

866
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,520
observed themselves doing that

867
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,439
any other comments on that

868
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,320
yeah can I just ask you if there's a

869
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,140
zero prior can it still be updated such

870
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,720
that there is a non-zero posterior

871
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,140
yes that is going to come in

872
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,399
foreign

873
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,579
conjugate prior we were just talking

874
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:02,160
about it in the chapter seven and that's

875
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,859
what's called learning by Counting

876
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,900
so in that setting you basically like

877
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,940
each time you observe the two options

878
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,540
you drop one ball of that color into an

879
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,900
urn and then your posterior is just

880
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,520
sampling from that urn

881
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,500
so if you have one

882
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,599
um one blue and one green

883
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,579
then the third ball is going to like

884
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,760
update your posterior a lot whereas if

885
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,319
you've got a thousand of each then that

886
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,900
two thousandth and first ball is not

887
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,160
going to update it that much so that's

888
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,200
like more recalcitrant to learning and

889
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,700
then now someone says oh now there are

890
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,140
orange balls

891
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,900
okay I observed an orange ball okay now

892
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,880
we have one orange ball and a thousand

893
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,780
blue and a thousand green

894
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,220
one reason why those models are not like

895
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,319
those models are very situational like

896
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,900
there's no General so answer or or

897
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,480
solution about like adding and also from

898
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,240
a um computational perspective like that

899
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,579
you need to start some of the variables

900
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:08,339
need to change their dimensionality

901
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,140
and so

902
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,119
currently tools are being developed to

903
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,760
facilitate

904
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,619
specifying and updating the

905
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,319
dimensionality of these models because a

906
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:20,700
lot of the things that people are just

907
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,520
intuitively curious about are like well

908
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,140
what happens when

909
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,599
somebody gets a piece of information

910
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,119
that helps them realize that a new

911
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,740
affordance is possible and not new

912
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,720
affordance then in the future may or may

913
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,280
not open up another foreign it's like

914
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,839
yeah

915
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,240
cool situation to model

916
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,859
not going to have a general solution at

917
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,160
this point

918
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,720
and last of the pre-stated questions

919
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,540
the 38 they say vfv minimization is the

920
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,400
key outside Loop of active

921
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
sufficient to optimize perception of

922
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,420
beliefs about policies

923
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,980
however the notion of policy was

924
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,900
introduced in the context of efe which

925
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,760
is an imagined future thing whereas vfv

926
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,980
is right now

927
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,839
how can beliefs about policies come into

928
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,099
vfv without efe

929
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,160
any thoughts on this

930
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,260
expected free energy is explicitly

931
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,880
calculated

932
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,220
over policies about

933
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,759
um future observations

934
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,339
variational free energy as the question

935
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:50,220
suggested is about the current status of

936
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,200
the variational distribution

937
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,960
and incoming data

938
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
so they're just calculating something

939
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,140
slightly different

940
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,160
um

941
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,319
without efe we simply have energy-based

942
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,380
learning via minimization of vfe

943
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,720
only by calculation of expected free

944
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,460
energy over policy do we get the active

945
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,640
part of active inference yes

946
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,160
expected free energy could be applied at

947
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,900
the one time step

948
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,560
Horizon

949
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,440
um

950
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,800
I'm sure there's other nuances and ways

951
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,599
to address it

952
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,260
but broadly variational free energy is

953
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,180
reactive

954
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,480
in that it's an ongoing unfolding flow

955
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,339
between the generative model and the

956
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,440
incoming data

957
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,619
but it could it can be calculated of

958
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:49,920
active or passive entities

959
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,819
expected free energy makes a proactive

960
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:59,180
yeah and vfv the the it could describe

961
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,460
unplanned

962
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,220
reflexive optimal activity

963
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,160
whereas to explicitly consider policy

964
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,500
counterfactuals as such

965
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,079
and evaluate sequences of future

966
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,180
possibilities

967
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,000
only efe has that capacity

968
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,819
okay great great question

969
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,140
um Scott when one model is a candle

970
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,880
flame or pendulum will they only use vfe

971
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,460
yeah so some years ago I'll go for it

972
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,579
first

973
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,619
uh you're just about vfp and

974
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:40,700
um efe uh well actually

975
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,359
uh efe

976
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,520
includes both uh planning and I mean

977
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,880
action selection planning and also

978
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,359
decision making but uh variation free

979
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:58,020
energy is uh just about uh I mean it's

980
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,180
not just about planning so efe also

981
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,540
uh includes the action selection or

982
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,859
policy selection and uh of course it's a

983
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,260
requirement for planning and any kind of

984
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,599
decision making but in vfe uh it's just

985
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,180
an uh inference we get by

986
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,380
minimizing that

987
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,099
um

988
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:30,420
parameter but in the next stage when we

989
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,079
want to act upon that inference we use

990
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,660
efe for the action selection and

991
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,780
decision making and so on

992
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,760
thank you yes

993
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,339
um a few answers on using a candle flame

994
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,000
so here in the strange particles paper

995
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,540
um

996
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,220
thinking about a modeling iterative

997
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,540
process

998
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,819
first we could say we're going to model

999
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:55,920
it as an inner particle

1000
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,780
and then if there's no statistical

1001
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,060
variance left to describe

1002
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,220
you've done good enough

1003
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,319
but you might also need to appeal to a

1004
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,180
latent cause like oh it's like it's a

1005
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,280
guitar string that's resonating but it's

1006
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,619
also like there's like a little gnome

1007
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,720
with a circadian rhythm latent Clause

1008
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,160
inside

1009
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,740
and then it's like the next level of

1010
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,359
strange particles like oh this guitar

1011
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:19,980
string is resonating and there's a

1012
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,480
circadian gnome

1013
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,180
and I think the gnome thinks about what

1014
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,640
I'm going to do

1015
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,500
but each of those are an empirical

1016
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,119
question about what level of

1017
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,760
sophistication of cognitive model is

1018
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,319
relevant for a given situation

1019
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,280
and yes earlier versions before expected

1020
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,680
free energy was even introduced

1021
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,079
octave was

1022
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,480
vse based

1023
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,359
and efe was proposed to explicitly

1024
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,480
account four counterfactuals in planning

1025
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,359
because in the earliest iterations it

1026
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,400
was like well we'll just calculate vfv

1027
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,619
that's like the real

1028
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:05,339
variable anyway so let's just do vfv on

1029
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:08,099
generative models

1030
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,560
and then like just sort of be guided

1031
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,119
step by step

1032
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,760
and then efe like kind of

1033
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,280
ultimately describes and and invokes

1034
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,619
variables that vfv doesn't like expected

1035
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,140
future observations

1036
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,859
foreign

1037
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,720
questions

1038
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,380
um

1039
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,780
just want to quickly

1040
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,520
look through

1041
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,099
where we're going to go in chapter three

1042
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,740
we can of course come back to it for the

1043
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,660
coming two weeks but any questions or

1044
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,940
thoughts or structuring or notes that

1045
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,220
people want to add

1046
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,800
um leading up to it of course the more

1047
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,579
the better so beginning with a Dawkins

1048
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:53,760
quote about survival machines

1049
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,260
chapter 2

1050
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,040
was free energy as a means free energy

1051
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,380
as a how variational Bayesian inference

1052
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,760
as a how

1053
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,099
here free energy is going to be

1054
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,380
approached from the Y

1055
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,839
which is going to be the avoidal of

1056
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,700
surprising States

1057
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,040
and the ways that that is Manifest

1058
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,260
across like self-organized systems and

1059
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,579
self-modeling systems

1060
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,400
Markov blankets are introduced I'm sure

1061
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,200
we'll have a lot of fun discussion so

1062
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,240
please all questions that people have on

1063
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,760
the topic just write them out you

1064
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,380
leverage it by like a hundred thousand

1065
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,119
when you actually write it out and

1066
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,400
improve others questions because there

1067
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,780
are many questions that we have about

1068
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,940
these areas

1069
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,920
um Markov blankets are defined a certain

1070
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,760
way

1071
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,160
in a certain way that's carrying less

1072
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,839
philosophical baggage than many

1073
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,920
initially suspect

1074
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,700
the action perception Loops which were

1075
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,859
presented as Loops in the previous

1076
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,180
chapter

1077
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,940
are here presented in what's known as

1078
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,800
the particular partition

1079
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,200
it's a particular partition because it's

1080
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,660
a it's a joke first off it's a specific

1081
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,220
way to do it it's not the only way to do

1082
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,839
it it's particular

1083
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,220
also what it partitions is called a

1084
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,859
particle the particle is the blanket and

1085
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,900
internal States that's why these are

1086
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,940
called interactive conservative and

1087
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,059
strange particles the particle is the

1088
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,059
generative model of the agent

1089
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,819
so the particular partition

1090
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:32,460
helps us operationalize that action

1091
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,040
perception Loop scheme

1092
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,400
into a more proper Bayesian graph

1093
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,200
setting

1094
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,359
which enables message passing all these

1095
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,559
other things

1096
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,359
figure 3.2

1097
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,140
is showing a simple example of how

1098
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,780
Markov blankets are used in inference

1099
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,900
not in some super recursive clinical

1100
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,140
setting just in terms of like some

1101
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,079
stochastic variables and the ways that

1102
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,400
different variables have information

1103
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,119
about one another and particularly how

1104
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,780
internal and external states can still

1105
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,540
contain information about each other

1106
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,400
despite being mediated only through the

1107
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,160
blanket

1108
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,680
3.3 agents with Markov blankets

1109
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,980
appear to model the external environment

1110
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,480
in the sense that internal States

1111
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,900
correspond to a representation of

1112
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,240
external states of the system

1113
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,880
so there's not like a little thermometer

1114
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,859
inside of the head of the generative

1115
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:35,880
model

1116
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,460
but there are some statistical patterns

1117
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,260
such that we can say that there's Mutual

1118
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,420
information between some part of the

1119
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,760
temperature and some part of the

1120
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,319
generative model

1121
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,440
otherwise the agent's actions would be

1122
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,380
in sentient with respect to that

1123
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,300
environmental variable so that's like

1124
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,520
where we get cybernetics good regulator

1125
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,280
theorem law of requisite diversity

1126
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,200
there's a turn towards

1127
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,660
uh or a nod to

1128
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,240
some of the Bayesian physics

1129
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,640
by Framing the process of surprise

1130
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,160
minimization as a hamiltonian principle

1131
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,140
of least action we're going to talk

1132
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,700
about it more

1133
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,339
short summary least action does not mean

1134
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,700
most lazy if you shoot a ball out of a

1135
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,800
cannon and it follows a parabola that is

1136
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,079
the path of least action so least action

1137
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,720
does not mean least ATP using it doesn't

1138
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,940
mean least carbohydrate burning

1139
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,440
doesn't mean smallest computational

1140
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,040
model it's a technical physics term

1141
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,920
that has a very important meaning and

1142
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,119
you'll hear first and others

1143
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,839
characterize fep as a principle of least

1144
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,880
action for a cognitive systems

1145
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,300
3.4 relationship between inference

1146
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,880
cognition and stochastic Dynamics

1147
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,400
like why are we even talking about

1148
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,059
cognition as inference and talking about

1149
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:07,740
all of the statistical stochastic stuff

1150
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,900
so here they juxtapose statistical

1151
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,160
physics

1152
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,920
which has long had an imperative of

1153
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,619
minimizing free energy

1154
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:19,200
with Bayesian Infamous inference and

1155
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,819
information Theory

1156
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,280
which can be mobilized to provide

1157
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,920
cognitive interpretations under the

1158
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,660
Bayesian brain framework

1159
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,859
free energy

1160
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:35,040
again we're not simply talking about ATP

1161
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,500
being burnt

1162
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,300
it's not Gibbs free energy it's not

1163
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,400
calories

1164
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,460
but it might have some relationships

1165
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,280
3.41 variational free energy model

1166
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
evidence and surprise

1167
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,760
fancy letter surprise as model evidence

1168
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,099
we'll come back to it

1169
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,280
expected free energy

1170
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,760
here we had vfe and surprise real-time

1171
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,700
unfolding model evidence as surprise

1172
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,119
here's prospective efe and inference to

1173
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,280
the most likely trajectory

1174
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,700
and 3.5 octave inference a novel

1175
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,380
Foundation to understand behavior and

1176
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,800
cognition

1177
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,640
some summary

1178
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,740
of the above

1179
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,140
and a little bit of unpacking

1180
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,200
about how behavior and cognition are

1181
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,660
being unified in active inference

1182
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,440
3.6 models policies and trajectories

1183
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,740
more discussion about those topics

1184
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,260
reconciliation of inactive cybernetic

1185
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,640
and predictive theories under octave

1186
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,079
inference

1187
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,180
those three apparently disconnected

1188
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,599
theoretical perspectives are reconciled

1189
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,720
in this section according to the authors

1190
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,520
and then moving even further active

1191
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,079
inference from the emergence of life to

1192
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,099
agency is where again in only a several

1193
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:01,140
short paragraphs such as the tip of the

1194
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,440
iceberg

1195
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,020
there's some discussion of General

1196
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,559
um

1197
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,099
sentience and agentic properties

1198
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,680
of the generative models the kind that

1199
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,940
we're modeling with active inference

1200
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,740
side box on entropy minimization

1201
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,839
yes hardly any maths in chapter three

1202
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,760
yeah let's see

1203
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,680
um

1204
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:34,098
not in the second half okay equation 3.2

1205
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,680
equation 3.1 but both of them are kind

1206
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,520
of definitional and surely are described

1207
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,180
naturally in the text

1208
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,260
definition in the Box three so yes

1209
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,220
different style

1210
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,200
but it's a breather before chapter four

1211
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,319
hits hard again with a math so

1212
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:56,940
thank you all

1213
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,579
looking forward to the comments and talk

1214
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:02,180
to you next week
