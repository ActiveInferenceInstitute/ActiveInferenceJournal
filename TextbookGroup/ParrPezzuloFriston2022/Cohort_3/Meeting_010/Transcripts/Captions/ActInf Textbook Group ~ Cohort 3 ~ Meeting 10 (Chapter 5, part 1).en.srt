1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,440
hello thanks everyone for joining it's

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,240
March 29th 2023 we're in cohort 3 having

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,259
our first discussion on chapter five

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,100
so before we go into any questions or

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,779
look at the text

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,340
does anyone

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,619
want to just provide any general

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,380
reflection or thought on

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,720
chapter 5 or just the first half of the

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,380
book up till now

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,719
just unmute and go for it if you want to

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,520
okay let's look to chapter five

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,280
and then um

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,860
I'm sure people have many

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,119
thoughts as we get going

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,619
any general thoughts on five

17
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,119
or on this opening quotation about

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
plants and animals

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,100
well there are plants that move and the

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,920
the there does seem to be some

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,740
um thought that there are

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,000
interconnections between

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,600
um uh plants that they have a something

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,960
that while it is not a an animal uh

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,140
central nervous system they have they

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,979
that there there are

27
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,220
patterns within the um

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,380
architecture that have

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,200
similar functions and it's the timeline

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,600
over which they operate is much longer

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,500
I very much agree with that

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,220
here's my PhD advisor Deborah

33
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,140
and a paper from 1989

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,819
describing the plant's Behavior idea

35
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,720
and then

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,300
I believe a more closer to our area

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,260
is this 2017 paper

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,780
on plant predictive processing with

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,819
friston

40
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,360
so agreed the the this quote

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
it's a little bit of like time scale

42
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
dependent it's just kind of like a

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,160
it's a fun first pass but isn't that

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,440
interesting that it's like

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,900
it's actually not so Stark or the plants

46
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,940
that do respond like the Venus

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,140
flycatchers and everything

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,360
but

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
here in this chapter we're going to be

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,879
focused on the mammalian nervous system

51
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,099
and body

52
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,640
not the morphology of the nervous system

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,159
or like morphological development

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,580
okay

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,920
anyone please just raise your hand or or

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,040
write something otherwise let's just go

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,140
through chapter five and just look at

58
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,159
some

59
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
potentially interesting pieces

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,060
this is an interesting concept that not

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,040
every variable depends on every other

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,019
variable

63
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,959
and that's sparsity

64
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,860
and so there's sparsity in the brain

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,720
there are many connections but of the

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,819
space of the possible it's quite sparse

67
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,940
and similarly in statistical models

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,459
the sparser they are the easier they are

69
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,140
to fit

70
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,459
doesn't mean that it's going to be

71
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,500
better and a lot of modeling is about

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,599
finding the trade-off point between like

73
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,660
model complexity and model accuracy

74
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,979
because if you enable every Edge

75
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,259
it's going to be a really laborious

76
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,360
calculation

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,580
but if you restrict edges that are

78
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,380
actually important

79
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,780
you might have a very rapidly

80
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,400
fit model

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,040
however it might not reflect some of the

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,440
importance true causal relationships

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,060
amongst variables

84
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,400
so

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,900
that comes up in different ways

86
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,100
let us take a step back from the

87
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
technical material of chapter four

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,820
everyone

89
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,800
breathes aside

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,419
and turn our attention to the process

91
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,840
Theory's accompanying active inference

92
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,060
here they point to the difference

93
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,820
between a principal

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,680
free energy principle

95
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,380
which is that systems are described by

96
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,320
their Dynamics on free energy Landscapes

97
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,280
and that persistence is associated with

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,100
reduction of free energy

99
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,280
to the extent that agency is exerted

100
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,000
and a process theory about how any given

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,520
system may actually

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,479
Implement those kinds of Dynamics

103
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,780
so a principle cannot be falsified and

104
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,100
this is at the root of a lot of

105
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,860
questions and commentary around like the

106
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,740
falsification capacity for the free

107
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,919
energy principle and the simplest thing

108
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,100
as far as I've seen is neither can a

109
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,440
linear regression be falsified

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,380
it's just not within the space of being

111
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,360
confirmed or rejected or falsified by

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,340
anything at all

113
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,340
it's just a proposed model framework

114
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,139
as a principle

115
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,460
now any given linear regression

116
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,280
which is a specific hypothesis about how

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,320
that principle of linear regression or

118
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,780
the principle of the L2 Norm might be

119
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,840
implemented that given

120
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,419
linear model might be adequate or not

121
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,940
more adequate or totally inadequate or

122
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
however but it is more subject and

123
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,880
answerable to empirical data

124
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,100
so free energy principle

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,440
is not really in the space or the game

126
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,539
of falsification

127
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,340
or not

128
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,039
nor does it even engage with empirical

129
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,020
data directly

130
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,740
whereas proposed and manifest

131
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,080
models

132
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,600
are directly addressing empirical data

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,520
and empirical data speak to their

134
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
validity

135
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,699
so

136
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,800
none of the above chapters that we've

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,940
read

138
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,400
could be falsified by any observation in

139
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,419
the world

140
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,360
or they're just kind of

141
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,100
theoretical

142
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,440
whereas the models that are going to

143
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,860
start to be shown in in chapter five

144
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,139
are going to be structural and

145
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,680
computational hypotheses about models of

146
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,900
the nervous system and this they're more

147
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,460
addressable and answerable it's a real

148
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,199
data Jonathan

149
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,039
foreign

150
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,680
would it be reasonable to say that

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,120
um it may or may not be true that the

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,580
free energy principle is applicable to

153
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,580
certain Real World Systems but not that

154
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,900
the principle itself is wrong just that

155
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,620
it's not applicable

156
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,919
what does anyone want to add on that

157
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,560
Ali go for it

158
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,780
uh actually I came across a kind of a

159
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,720
situation that kind of contradicts some

160
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
of the claims of active inference or fep

161
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,639
uh about their scope of applicability

162
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,099
recently so

163
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm not sure if you're familiar with

164
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,780
Stefan ferner's uh some of some of

165
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,840
Stephen Thurman's recent work but

166
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,580
basically uh he claims that uh complex

167
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,139
systems

168
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,919
um include a set of systems that are

169
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:29,960
only

170
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,260
non-markopian and non-ergotic systems

171
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,899
but on the other hand we had this notion

172
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,919
we have this requirement for any system

173
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,979
that is to be modeled in active

174
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,740
inference framework to be ergotic and

175
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,019
markovian systems

176
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,560
although in some recent literature

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,839
they've dropped this requirement for the

178
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,339
system to be ergotic but again I believe

179
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,100
uh a kind of local ergoticity needs to

180
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,440
be present in order for the system to be

181
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,220
to be modeled in fep or active inference

182
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,180
framework so uh

183
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,000
as as far as I know the scope of

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
applicability is

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,420
at least so far uh not strictly

186
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,320
uh defined or let's say it's not

187
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,740
something that can be

188
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,380
restricted in a definitional way but

189
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,920
there are degrees of applicabilities so

190
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,660
for instance

191
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,959
um in uh Dalton's Dalton's active

192
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,620
Edibles weak markup when a week blankets

193
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,720
paper

194
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,459
uh he has this notion of uh degrees of

195
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,740
blanketedness uh that helps us to

196
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,519
deliver distinguish between the systems

197
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,080
that have effective markup blankets and

198
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,899
the otherwise linear systems uh that

199
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,839
doesn't contain any kind of

200
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,899
um effective blanketedness uh so

201
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,300
briefly he claims that for higher

202
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,740
dimensional and complex systems we we

203
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,860
can apply these Bayesian mechanical

204
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,640
framework uh but

205
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,959
as for linear systems although

206
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,640
theoretically it is applicable for those

207
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,240
systems as well but it wouldn't result

208
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,940
in an interesting

209
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,800
uh an interesting uh Behavior because it

210
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
would basically be a kind of trivial

211
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
thing to apply uh these

212
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
Frameworks for a simple or simple in in

213
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,820
the sense of being linear systems

214
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,300
thank you ollie very um

215
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,920
very deep answer Michael

216
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,140
yeah I also read in some context that

217
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,100
this fep would explain how a system can

218
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,620
come into

219
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,060
the steady state

220
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,459
but it cannot explain how it comes out

221
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,100
why what triggers

222
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,700
um

223
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,860
the system to go out of that steady

224
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,519
state but this is constantly observed

225
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,700
right I mean we are not always in a

226
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,100
steady state but also jump into other

227
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,120
states

228
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,700
so I was I don't know whether this is an

229
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,519
implication exactly from what Ali you

230
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,060
said but I said that's why this free

231
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,000
energy principle could not be applied to

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,920
living systems even I think

233
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
yes thank you

234
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
well a lot of perspectives let's like

235
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,339
Focus that kind of question on on the

236
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,899
material of chapter five which is the

237
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,399
mammalian nervous system and behavior so

238
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,279
with copious citations and empirical

239
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,720
evidence

240
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,880
they're going to be talking about places

241
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,640
where the fep and active have been

242
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,079
applied

243
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,740
and so this is going to be much more

244
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,060
empirical and tangible and anatomical

245
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,459
than previous chapters

246
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,899
so whereas

247
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,060
the generative model proposed in chapter

248
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,320
four

249
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,720
and the high and the low road by which

250
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,360
that generative model is reached in

251
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,860
chapters three and two

252
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,500
were kind of in principle

253
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,200
here we're going to see a lot more about

254
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,019
what it looks like in practice

255
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,399
and that's going to mean that it's in

256
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,459
reference to a specific kind of system

257
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,620
like specific brain regions

258
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,000
and it's also going to mean that it's

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,820
answerable to empirical data

260
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,339
and that it's been published

261
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,440
according to professional communication

262
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,139
channels

263
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,220
signifying that it had unique

264
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,800
explanation or predictive power

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
so a lot of these are like fascinating

266
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
questions about the

267
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,980
hard and soft limits of applicability of

268
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,320
different methods

269
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,120
and we'll see in chapter five how that

270
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,899
plays out in practice

271
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,720
so again just write anything or raise

272
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,959
your hand if you'd like to to explore so

273
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
this chapter is not intended as the

274
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,160
final word on process theories

275
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,260
it's simply the interpretation that

276
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,120
seems most consistent with the currently

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,000
available evidence and

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,420
length constraints on the book

279
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,339
nors are aimed to endorse a specific

280
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,740
process Theory but to illustrate how the

281
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,779
ideas in the previous chapters may be

282
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,040
put to work

283
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,600
so if we were reading an anatomy

284
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,339
textbook or a psychology textbook it

285
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,680
would be like this is how it is

286
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,139
the elbow is connected to this and this

287
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,660
concept does this but the way that we're

288
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,740
going to be looking at the coming

289
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,720
examples

290
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,560
are like

291
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,860
representative of how models are

292
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,920
constructed that do

293
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,779
describe real systems of Interest

294
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,500
um

295
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,120
I'll

296
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,779
um bring your question

297
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,360
into here and and feel free to you can

298
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,519
continue this or add any more

299
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,760
information on what

300
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,300
type of generalist tools might help Coda

301
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,000
is certainly one generalist tool that

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,360
helps

303
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,980
and then there's many statistical

304
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,459
approaches that are more technical

305
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,980
so right now

306
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,420
we're going to be approaching this just

307
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,180
from the kind of like learning side but

308
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,980
the way that these models are

309
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,720
implemented

310
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,480
the code is generally available and so

311
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,220
this also provides some specific tools

312
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,220
and there may be other tools also but at

313
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,920
least tools that we use for learning

314
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,639
help us with Bayesian mechanics

315
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,680
in our engagement with it and then the

316
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,300
tools that actually Implement those

317
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,699
statistical models and then there may

318
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,040
also be other tools as well which would

319
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,120
be interesting to explore

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,220
um they describe the layout of the

321
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,360
chapter

322
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,699
which is going to be first focusing on

323
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,160
one of the most well-studied

324
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
neural systems which is the mammalian

325
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,260
cortex architecture

326
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,480
they're then going to expand into the

327
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,680
reflex arc

328
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,199
of the spinal cord and that will help us

329
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,079
look at the continuous time models of

330
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,579
perception and action

331
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,120
and then in section 5.4 talking about

332
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,839
decision making

333
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,839
all right

334
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,959
so in the end of chapter four

335
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
there were some representations that

336
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,500
looked like this

337
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,680
and this is showing two

338
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,519
um

339
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,920
related views

340
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,579
on a generative model on the left is a

341
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,279
hierarchical predictive processing model

342
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,980
where there are just as a graphical

343
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,240
convention

344
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,279
top-down predictions

345
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,160
and bottom-up sensory data and so this

346
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,720
is represented as kind of like a

347
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,220
skyscraper

348
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,279
just without reference to time the tilde

349
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,980
means Through Time

350
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,459
this in practice becomes unrolled

351
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,079
through these message passing

352
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,880
architectures and we talked a little bit

353
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,439
about that last week

354
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,240
here they're going to return to that

355
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
idea so

356
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,380
the skyscraper

357
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,040
the kinds of ways in which hierarchical

358
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,199
predictive processing architectures can

359
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,380
be

360
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,220
visualized or represented with a base

361
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,780
graph

362
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,660
those schemes

363
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,460
are going to be associated with

364
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,400
stereotype circuitry

365
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,200
and there's like

366
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,240
also coming from a long history of

367
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,039
taking pictures of the brain

368
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,860
an understanding of what the circuitry

369
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,120
is

370
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,580
in terms of synaptic connectivity and so

371
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,600
on

372
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,860
so they're going to describe a little

373
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,919
bit about this cortical column

374
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,100
and as an insect neuroscientist it's fun

375
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,419
to read all this because I just think

376
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,000
well this is one way it could be

377
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,940
but certainly all of these anatomical

378
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
details

379
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,240
they don't even necessarily have to be

380
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,059
that way for mammals but they definitely

381
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,039
don't have to be that way outside of

382
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,020
mammals

383
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,980
but connecting it to the reality of what

384
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,160
is empirically measured helps ground

385
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,760
Theory

386
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,820
and so figure 5.1 is going to be a side

387
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,140
by side

388
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,080
of the anatomy

389
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,440
of the cortical layers

390
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,679
has this mapping been done for the Clans

391
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,320
the synaptic connectivity of the um

392
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,380
whatever it is 302 neurons in the C

393
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,179
elegans

394
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,320
um for the most part has been completed

395
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,520
so snap connectivity does Maps do exist

396
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,440
oh I I mean the sort of the the

397
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,740
relationship between that map and and

398
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,360
the message passing

399
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,340
um that we we see here

400
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,840
um sort of the mapping between what

401
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,340
we're seeing on the left

402
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,660
um and what we're seeing in the middle

403
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,020
and the right

404
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,280
it would be awesome

405
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,960
as far as I know there is not an

406
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,580
explicit

407
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,720
um

408
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,780
nematode or even

409
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,320
um fruit fly or any other

410
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,360
um type of mapping but I think that's

411
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,720
very exciting work because there's like

412
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
a whole nematode simulation and there

413
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,419
are with brain and body and biomechanics

414
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,700
and um there are similar projects for

415
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,799
the drosophila

416
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,940
um Fly

417
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,140
so the um bulk of the work

418
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,740
of these authors Kristen at all and and

419
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,740
building on the legacy of SPM most of

420
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,179
the work has been done in human

421
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,059
neuroanatomy

422
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,520
and so not many people were considering

423
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,419
Beyond like the human neuroimaging case

424
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,740
until more recently

425
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,840
so

426
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,380
these six layers of the cortex are

427
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,780
defined histologically

428
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,720
so just from a tissue definition they

429
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,059
have some morphological differences and

430
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,799
they also have like some gene expression

431
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,919
and protein expression differences

432
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,720
and these edges

433
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,700
represent

434
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,820
physical structural connections amongst

435
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,380
different

436
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,160
um regions

437
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,080
it's juxtaposed and and these are kind

438
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,960
of the outputs inputs and outputs

439
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,880
with these the thalamus and so on

440
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,580
sending inputs into layer four

441
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,440
and then this kind of resonance

442
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,900
processing happening within a columnar

443
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,500
unit and then the outputs of this layer

444
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,220
5 cell going on to the decision making

445
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,440
areas that are going to be discussed in

446
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,419
Section 5 4.

447
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,380
and it's juxtaposed in kind of a visual

448
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,020
rhetorical Style

449
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,580
with

450
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,039
statistical

451
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,900
representations about what these

452
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,700
populations of cells might be doing

453
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,419
so that is helping

454
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,700
connect

455
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,179
the semantics of these variables

456
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,059
like this one is an error on this and

457
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,679
this one's a variance estimator on that

458
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,679
and this one's getting inputs about this

459
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,179
all those kinds of things that we want

460
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,919
to like talk about what a statistical

461
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,260
variable is doing

462
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,520
and mapping that onto empirically

463
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,500
observed patterns of neuroanatomy

464
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,299
now this is going to be kind of course

465
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,860
grained

466
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,520
this columnar unit which is repeated

467
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
thousands of times in the mammalian

468
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
cortex

469
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,580
is going to be abstracted

470
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,679
from the deep to the superficial

471
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,740
so this is that layer um

472
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,480
one two three four five six

473
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,179
superficial towards the surface of the

474
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,280
brain and then the deeper regions of the

475
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,360
cortex

476
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,500
so that

477
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,080
is going to be like one unit in this

478
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,299
figure 5.2

479
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,580
they have simplified what's happening

480
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,000
within a cortical region

481
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,400
to highlight what is happening amongst

482
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,980
cortical regions

483
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,960
and so there's processing happening

484
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,720
within a column

485
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,080
and also columns can serve as bottom up

486
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
and top down

487
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,200
for each other

488
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,220
so they're interacting laterally

489
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,900
from an anatomical perspective

490
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,880
however in this representation

491
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,700
the one on the right is like sending

492
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,559
top-down predictions to the one on the

493
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,059
left

494
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,600
and then bottom up prediction errors or

495
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,820
sensory inputs are coming up

496
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,880
to the one on the right

497
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,400
so this is showing that

498
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,220
predictive processing architectures can

499
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,600
be implemented laterally across cortical

500
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
columns

501
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,100
and this is at the root of a lot of

502
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,860
current computational modeling efforts

503
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,480
just

504
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
we'll leave it there and we'll return to

505
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,299
it

506
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,179
can I ask um

507
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,140
is that are they the Taylor series that

508
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,740
is that what that is the ascending

509
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,200
prediction or it's a I I was trying to

510
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,760
understand this Taylor series and it

511
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,760
seemed to be like a a way of

512
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,299
um creating a set of protections from a

513
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,760
function and you know so

514
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,220
whenever I looked at this I thought

515
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,880
that's the Taylor series

516
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,020
am I wrong in that

517
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,900
it it's a great insight and I think uh

518
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,340
as with with many of these things it's

519
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,860
like if you if you needed and want it to

520
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,520
be you can connect those locations so

521
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,960
for example

522
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,179
here's figure 4.3

523
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,799
and

524
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
um in the discrete time case we were

525
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,159
making explicit predictions about the

526
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,020
past present and future

527
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,480
in the continuous time case

528
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,580
rather than making explicit predictions

529
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,820
about the past present and future

530
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,059
we have the x hidden State variable

531
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,580
first derivative second derivative and

532
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,580
so on on X so that is like the Taylor

533
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,340
series coefficients

534
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,900
now

535
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,840
one could propose what if what this

536
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,880
cortical column was doing

537
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,720
was X

538
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,580
so it is getting sensory input this is

539
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,020
going to be raw sensory input coming in

540
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,659
or just from some other location and it

541
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,100
is going to be doing the role of

542
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,620
inference about X

543
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,000
and then

544
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,940
it is going to be constrained and

545
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,140
constraining

546
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,179
the rate of change in X so let's assign

547
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,620
the computational function of this

548
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,200
middle unit to like the derivative of x

549
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,240
and this one to the second derivative of

550
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,860
x

551
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,159
so this architecture could Implement

552
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,559
something like a Taylor series

553
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,900
approximation

554
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,840
you can make it that way in silico and

555
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,419
then you'll know or if you're talking

556
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,740
about real

557
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,200
brains

558
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,820
of course they're not actually doing a

559
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,679
Taylor series approximation on the

560
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,940
coefficients

561
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,039
but computationally they might be doing

562
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,240
something akin to it

563
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,460
so thank you Phillip yeah thank you so

564
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,440
figure 5.1

565
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,799
highlighted how layer 5 of the cortex

566
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,720
is going to be

567
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,100
projecting out

568
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,240
here's layer five

569
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,100
projecting out to some of these motor

570
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,719
and decision-making regions

571
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,440
so now we're going to treat the

572
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,600
descending prediction from that cortical

573
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
region

574
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
we're just going to have it up here

575
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,980
starting from the BET cells in layer 5

576
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,480
of the motor cortex so here's the BET

577
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,880
cells here's the motor cortex here's

578
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,480
like the brain

579
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,919
is sending a descending prediction

580
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,220
two in this case a cross-section of the

581
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,200
spinal cord

582
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
foreign

583
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,460
sensory data is incoming to the spinal

584
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,080
cord

585
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,779
through proprioception

586
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,159
afferent

587
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,020
means away

588
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,559
from the sensor efferent means to the

589
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,760
sensor

590
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,980
so proprioceptive data are coming away

591
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,140
from the sensor

592
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,880
and in

593
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,500
the actual

594
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
histology of the spinal cord

595
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,659
descending predictions about

596
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,520
proprioception

597
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,620
how one is expected to feel

598
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,240
and then the incoming proprioceptive

599
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,500
information

600
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,380
are being juxtaposed in this discrepancy

601
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,740
variable

602
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,299
subtracting the predictions from the

603
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,919
incoming data so just a simple

604
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,880
differencing

605
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,799
results in an error that says how much

606
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,840
muscle contraction would be required to

607
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,760
meet the prediction

608
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,580
so if the prediction is exactly what the

609
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,440
incoming data are

610
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,720
the discrepancy is zero

611
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,500
and no motor action is instigated

612
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,620
if it's non-zero motor auction would be

613
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,020
instigated

614
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,240
lower motor neurons then cause this

615
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,740
muscle contraction or relaxation

616
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,120
ensuring that the resulting

617
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,220
proprioceptive data match descending

618
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,700
predictions

619
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,360
so

620
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,539
we can have continuous this is a an

621
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,220
opportunity and and where continuous

622
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,320
time models have been studied a lot

623
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,900
because the incoming sensory data are

624
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,340
continuous

625
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,020
for example

626
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,380
um perceived uh weight

627
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,700
or just a different tactile Sensations

628
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,919
and then the outgoing

629
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,960
Behavior

630
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,940
can also be framed in a continuous

631
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,500
setting

632
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,059
like the elbow angle

633
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,179
and so this is like a simple statistical

634
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,039
architecture

635
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,419
that

636
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,059
situates motor action

637
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,000
as resolving the discrepancy

638
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
between predictions incoming

639
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,260
and data incoming

640
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,779
they move on to another region of the

641
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,860
mammalian nervous system

642
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,419
cortical layer 5 targets several other

643
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,919
structures

644
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,659
beyond the spinal cord

645
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,380
amongst these is the stratum

646
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,720
with these regions

647
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,840
and a lot is known about that region in

648
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
terms of gene expression and protein

649
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,240
expression and neurophysiology

650
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,620
so they're describing some of the

651
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,960
empirical

652
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
neurophysiology neuroanatomy

653
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,679
talking about figure 5.4 it's going to

654
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,380
come up

655
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,140
several Pages later though so just keep

656
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,880
that in mind

657
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,740
they're going to be talking

658
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,679
about policy selection

659
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,039
in the context of expected free energy

660
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,720
so here

661
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,059
we didn't need to talk about planning at

662
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,140
all

663
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,480
and continuous time models

664
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,899
are very Adept at describing these

665
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,820
situations where no explicit planning is

666
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,919
required but still adoptive action can

667
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,740
occur and we revisit that in chapter 8

668
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,779
on continuous time models

669
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,460
but now we're going to look at like

670
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,419
decision making kind of classical

671
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,659
psychologist type categorical decision

672
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:04,980
making

673
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,799
especially thinking about explicit

674
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,340
planning

675
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,100
and then they're going to talk about how

676
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,140
the architecture works but

677
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,500
we'll talk about that when we see it

678
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,320
dopamine tone is going to modulate the

679
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,659
balance of the two sides of the figure

680
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,600
and perturbations of dopamine are going

681
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,779
to have some behavioral and cognitive

682
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,399
consequences that are completely

683
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,080
compatible with this model

684
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,360
and just in general

685
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,059
the anatomy of figure 5 4 is endorsed by

686
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,620
evidence from both Clinical Pathology

687
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,840
and cellular morphology

688
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,000
so it's not the only map you can draw of

689
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,260
the territory

690
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,539
it isn't the territory itself

691
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,700
but

692
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,600
the map shown here is compatible with

693
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
the complexity of the territory

694
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,559
okay

695
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,880
so now

696
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,880
we're going to take those

697
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,140
um

698
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,940
just like they started the section off

699
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,240
on

700
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,740
outputs of cortical layer 5 are going to

701
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,320
Target other areas not just the spinal

702
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,559
cord

703
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,260
so

704
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,120
we're going to have

705
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,919
um

706
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,140
one

707
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,659
of those cortical outputs

708
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:36,140
sending into this brain region

709
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,659
there are going to be two Pathways

710
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,600
Illustrated so

711
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,779
one might be an effect or the other

712
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:50,039
and dopamine with this gamma variable

713
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,140
is um

714
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,440
modulating the balance between the two

715
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,679
so it's kind of like a rudder

716
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,960
the computational rule of dopamine is

717
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
acting like a Rudder with which one of

718
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,260
these Pathways is being

719
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,039
deployed

720
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,059
at a given time

721
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,980
here are what those two pathways are and

722
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,480
again this is going to be like a

723
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,460
behavioral computational

724
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,559
account

725
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,539
but it's also consistent with the

726
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,100
anatomy and with the clinical findings

727
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,299
What's called the indirect pathway

728
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,440
is one where the E vector

729
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,480
which is our habit

730
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,159
the affordances

731
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,380
are encoded in e

732
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,080
so different opportunities for Action

733
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,740
are enumerated in E and the numbers in

734
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,039
each of those cells refer to their prior

735
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,659
probability

736
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,760
so if there's um

737
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,100
up down left right there's going to be

738
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,960
four elements in e

739
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,559
and if it was 1 1 1 1 it means all

740
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:04,140
things are being equal

741
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,059
there's no prior

742
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,179
bias towards the direction to take

743
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,980
conversely in that up down left right

744
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,020
case what if it were a hundred one one

745
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,040
one

746
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,899
that would be equivalent to saying the

747
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,899
prior probability on going up is much

748
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,699
higher

749
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,300
and so in this indirect pathway the e

750
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,099
affordance vector

751
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,879
is basically being passed on through to

752
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,980
policy selection

753
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,418
and so policy posterior pi

754
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:41,280
is basically reflecting the policy prior

755
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,320
so

756
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,899
actions are being selected

757
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,060
proportional to how they have been

758
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,020
selected in the past

759
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,918
the distributions of actions being

760
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,280
selected in the indirect pathway

761
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,020
is being drawn from the same

762
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,000
distribution as habit

763
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,740
we can contrast that with what's called

764
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,599
by the neurophysiologist the direct

765
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,640
pathway

766
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,880
here we see that same kind of input

767
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,740
coming in

768
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,079
but rather than passing e on to Pi

769
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,700
we have G

770
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,720
so G

771
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,740
um is expected free energy

772
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,099
functional

773
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,500
so it's equation 2.6 and there's other

774
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,599
representations

775
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,780
and what G is doing

776
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,900
is taking in the E which is like not

777
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,119
shown but it does come into play so this

778
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,500
is not exhaustively showing every

779
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,060
variable just trying to only highlight

780
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,700
the differences between them really

781
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,099
G sharpens the action prior into

782
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,540
an action posterior

783
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,460
so that is updating the policy prior

784
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,619
into the posterior

785
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,720
through expected free energy

786
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,540
how does expected free energy

787
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,260
sharpen or modify the action prior into

788
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,060
the action posterior

789
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,940
it re-waits policies

790
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,859
according to their expected free energy

791
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,579
what is expected for energy

792
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,420
it's equation 2.6

793
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,800
so there's different decompositions

794
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,460
no one of which is simply like how it is

795
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,780
but policies are going to be updated

796
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,359
in becoming to their posterior

797
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,160
likelihood from which actions are

798
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,260
actually sampled from

799
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,000
and they're going to be sharpened or

800
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,820
updated according to

801
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,859
according to this Top Line

802
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,839
the pragmatic value and the information

803
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,400
gain of different policies

804
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,420
Michael

805
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,480
yeah one question so this posterior is

806
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,000
still an expected posterior

807
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,619
and we also have in the in the variation

808
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,300
free energy

809
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,220
another kind of posterior is that true

810
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,940
um every variable in Bayesian statistics

811
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,920
can be described that's that's going

812
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,599
undergoing updating

813
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,060
can be described of as having a prior

814
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,859
and then data comes in and then there's

815
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,420
the posterior

816
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,160
so here in particular we're talking

817
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,900
about the prior

818
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,920
and the posterior on action policies

819
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,960
but also we talk about priors and

820
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,380
posteriors for other kinds of variables

821
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,859
here the focus is how

822
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,660
um descending

823
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,640
information from the cerebral cortex

824
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,300
shapes policy selection

825
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,160
with the kind of neurophysiological

826
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,760
hypothesis not total expert that habit

827
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,040
is encoded

828
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,960
or represented

829
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,520
Within

830
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,320
this brain region

831
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,020
but cortical inputs

832
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,820
shift the balance towards a direct

833
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,079
pathway

834
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,220
so this is where we see like

835
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,400
deliberative decision making

836
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,140
because

837
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,240
we end up sharpening policies according

838
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,579
to their um

839
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,560
expected free energy so let's think

840
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,420
about like the famous marshmallow

841
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,920
example

842
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,380
um where a marshmallow is placed on a

843
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,359
table and someone can be taking it or

844
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,079
not

845
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,820
and they're told about what it is or

846
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,260
isn't or anything like that

847
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,700
so

848
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,500
if somebody had a habit of not taking

849
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,000
the marshmallow

850
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,980
then this pathway would lead them to not

851
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,839
take it if they had a habit of taking it

852
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,900
it would lead them to taking it

853
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,260
in this case in the direct pathway

854
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,780
policies would be evaluated

855
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,579
according to their epistemic and

856
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,020
pragmatic value

857
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,020
so in a model where pragmatic value or

858
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,060
sugar and there was a preference for

859
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,260
sugar

860
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,200
then policy selection would lead

861
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,240
to The Taking of the marshmallow

862
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,119
if pragmatic value in that model were

863
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,579
being defined as like Conformity to the

864
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,500
rules

865
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,500
then that Conformity would be realized

866
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,599
by not taking the marshmallow

867
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,260
so I know it's kind of like hard because

868
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,940
we're talking on one hand about actual

869
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,099
neurophysiology and behavioral patterns

870
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,619
but on the other hand about these

871
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,540
variables

872
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,260
but they're being juxtaposed here to to

873
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,300
show how it really does come into play

874
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,160
in empirical modeling yes Michael

875
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,380
but but all this um it's a planning this

876
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,140
is not based on an observation at that

877
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,420
moment right and how how does a surprise

878
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,960
uh come in there so surprise how can we

879
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,200
can can we also expect surprise and take

880
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,020
this into account in this um in this

881
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,920
expected free energy

882
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,859
so this is

883
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:23,520
um

884
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
showing just

885
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,520
a few distilled aspects of this graph

886
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,320
this is not the full model

887
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,000
observations are coming in

888
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,040
and so in that sense surprise being

889
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,480
about observations it could be

890
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,460
understood to be happening here it's

891
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,320
just not being like diagrammed

892
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,859
Yana what happens when there are more

893
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,440
options than a no nutrient stimulant yes

894
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,920
it um always

895
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,619
that's where we get into the um figure

896
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,579
9.1 not to look ahead but

897
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,800
depending on how the context is set up

898
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,900
for the experiment was it a two-choice

899
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,160
experiment was it a three-choice

900
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,599
experiment

901
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,260
and then that is the ethologists

902
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,060
challenge

903
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,960
to develop the as if View From the

904
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,400
Inside

905
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,619
the cognitive model of the subject

906
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,760
parameterized by their objective

907
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,920
behavior in this setting not the only

908
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,880
way to use these models

909
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,339
here

910
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,980
they uh

911
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,000
point to how certain dopamine signals

912
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,660
that famously incredibly famously

913
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,079
look like reward prediction errors

914
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,599
so one model of dopamine was like

915
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,060
dopamine is the reward molecule

916
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,119
and this Schultz 1997 paper was like

917
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,680
wait a minute

918
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,220
yes when more is received than expected

919
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,200
there's a dopamine Spike and that was

920
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,480
the pattern that people

921
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,940
um were associating with reward but if

922
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,980
it's the exact amount that was expected

923
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,380
there's no dopamine Spike

924
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,540
and if it's less than expected but still

925
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,540
a reward there's like another Spike

926
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,339
and so that was like wait a minute so

927
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,260
it's not just like a thermometer for

928
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,520
reward

929
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,280
maybe dopamine is doing something

930
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,300
like tracking prediction errors

931
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,760
so this is kind of like a proto-basian

932
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,060
brain proto-predictive coding

933
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,359
empirical find it

934
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,000
from the dopamine neurophysiology

935
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,460
that we now have like much much more

936
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,140
resolution on

937
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,960
and so active inference provides a

938
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,520
specific alternative explanation

939
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,020
to these phenomena

940
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,240
where we don't need to make all these

941
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,940
exceptions to a reward-based model well

942
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,500
it's dopamine is signaling reward but

943
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,000
then also it does that and also I don't

944
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,660
know why it does this

945
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,940
we can have a unified perspective

946
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,079
with active inference

947
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,640
on empirical data

948
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,440
here they're going to point to the idea

949
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,760
that

950
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,680
um specific hypotheses can be formed

951
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,660
yeah

952
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,579
another reason to use active inference

953
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:41,099
modeling for these kinds of cognitive uh

954
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:43,020
or I mean ultimately neurophysiological

955
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,599
settings

956
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,099
is that there can be non-invasive

957
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,920
measurement of precision parameters

958
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,300
and that's called computational

959
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,940
phenotyping and Ryan Smith and others

960
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,380
have done a lot of work on that

961
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,819
table 5.1

962
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,040
is going to list some of the important

963
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,079
neurotransmitters

964
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,119
and then even though neurotransmitters

965
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:06,960
do different things in different

966
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,760
settings and they're not saying

967
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,020
otherwise they're going to kind of

968
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,180
broadly associate it

969
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,859
with

970
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,880
a given computational function

971
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,980
so they interact and there's

972
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,480
neuropeptides and there's all this other

973
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,740
stuff happening

974
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,060
but broadly here are a bunch of lines of

975
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,980
evidence that support and understanding

976
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,900
of that neurotransmitter

977
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,800
associated with Precision acting on

978
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,819
these things

979
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,760
thanks for

980
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,839
um

981
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:46,279
sharing those Jonah

982
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,240
it reminds me of this um

983
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,140
2016 paper they gave ants

984
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,760
a choice between

985
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,740
um sugar water

986
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,000
and

987
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,700
um some dopamine drug

988
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,400
maybe morphine yeah morphine

989
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,079
and they like showed that they could

990
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,020
taper down the sugar

991
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,819
and the morphine and change a few

992
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:13,920
different things so that

993
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,859
um there was like a persistent

994
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:20,779
choice to go to the morphine

995
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,300
so I mean yes many many interesting

996
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,960
things to explore

997
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,020
but just to conclude on this part from

998
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,720
above computational phenotyping

999
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,300
basically means

1000
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,640
probing a generative model construct

1001
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,500
reducing our uncertainty about a

1002
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,760
generative model

1003
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,980
through peripheral measurements

1004
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,480
so for example

1005
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,700
pupil diameter

1006
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,099
and eye movements

1007
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,020
contain a lot of information on

1008
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,079
somebody's arousal and attention

1009
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,880
and so you don't need to have like an

1010
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,119
implantable neurotech per se

1011
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,040
you could use these non-invasive

1012
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,020
measurements

1013
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,060
and previously understood relationships

1014
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,380
like between pupil size and

1015
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,880
noradrenaline

1016
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,380
so that you could actually reduce your

1017
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,920
uncertainty about noradrenaline levels

1018
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,540
just by looking at the pupil

1019
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,640
they talk about heavy in plasticity

1020
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,020
and different statistical models

1021
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,960
5.6 continuous indiscrete hierarchies

1022
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,940
this is also

1023
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,660
um

1024
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,180
a topic that's treated a lot more

1025
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,220
extensively

1026
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,859
in live stream 46.

1027
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,300
active inference models do not

1028
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,079
contradict folk psychology

1029
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,119
but they highlight

1030
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,460
a move from continuous representations

1031
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,520
at low levels of a neural hierarchy

1032
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,339
for example continuous sensory input

1033
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,560
to categorical variables at higher

1034
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,859
levels especially associated with

1035
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:10,079
semantics identification and decision

1036
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,319
making

1037
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,760
so

1038
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,700
we're able to hold categorical beliefs

1039
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,099
and interface with continuously varying

1040
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,980
sensory receptors and effectors

1041
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,619
like muscle length or visual features

1042
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,520
that is just kind of brought up in these

1043
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,339
two short paragraphs in 5.6

1044
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,520
and then in figure eight

1045
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,700
point six this is an example of what the

1046
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,339
generative model looks like

1047
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,380
so at the higher level there's a missing

1048
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,540
line here but at the higher level we

1049
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,280
have a discrete time generative model

1050
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,440
partially observable Markov decision

1051
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,040
process pomdp how do we know because it

1052
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,579
has the Tau minus one Tau Tau plus one

1053
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,800
so this is making explicit predictions

1054
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,220
about the past present and future and in

1055
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,800
this case it's also making categorical

1056
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,480
inferences

1057
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,420
so is it a or b or oh it's a and b

1058
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,619
because those letters are also used here

1059
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,500
but is it raining or is it sunny

1060
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,240
and we're just going to have a

1061
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,859
categorical difference between those two

1062
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,319
and have that estimate happening past

1063
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,640
present future

1064
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,980
but then at each time step

1065
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,400
there's a continuous time model

1066
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,140
and so here we can recognize the

1067
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,300
continuous time model because we see

1068
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,200
that x x Prime X double Prime

1069
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,140
and so we have like this big rake

1070
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,119
Big E pointing down

1071
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,119
and then here's a smaller one

1072
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,520
so it's kind of like figure 4.3

1073
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,980
here's discrete time Model E pointing

1074
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,940
down

1075
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,540
continuous time Model E pointing down

1076
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,940
and then those are going to be

1077
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,400
grafted together

1078
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,060
so we have a higher order slower

1079
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,920
discrete time model

1080
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,300
and then a faster continuous time model

1081
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,160
so this could reflect and this is what

1082
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,280
they discuss in live stream 46.

1083
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,560
with um Alex Kiefer Ryan Smith and

1084
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,599
Maxwell ramstead

1085
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,099
they discuss how

1086
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,099
decision making like should I go to the

1087
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,160
baker or to the barber

1088
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,099
is occurring in a discrete like way

1089
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,980
in this decision making

1090
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,359
model

1091
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,339
but then the implementation of the

1092
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,280
decision-making model is happening in a

1093
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,839
continuous type model

1094
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,819
which they call motor active inference

1095
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:44,300
Mai

1096
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,079
um

1097
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,359
so the good thing about

1098
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,579
figure 4.3

1099
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:56,220
is these are enormously flexible methods

1100
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,380
this is not like the one and only way an

1101
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,680
active inference model looks it's really

1102
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,500
almost bewilderingly the opposite of

1103
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,700
that

1104
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,980
this isn't like the zoo of what's out

1105
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,640
there

1106
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,760
these are showing some of the structural

1107
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,020
possibilities for cognitive modeling

1108
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,480
and there are many possibilities and

1109
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,640
there's many ways to model the same

1110
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,640
phenomena

1111
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,980
um Jana asked how is the continuous

1112
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,740
hierarchy applied

1113
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,279
well

1114
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,480
you can add more information but one can

1115
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,819
make a hierarchical model where like the

1116
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:40,859
higher level was continuous and the

1117
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:43,740
output of a given like the Y here we

1118
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,420
could graft another continuous time

1119
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,200
model right here

1120
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,740
so these are like our our Lego kits

1121
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,480
these are a few Lego constructions that

1122
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,619
people have made

1123
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,200
that typify

1124
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,880
minimal skeletons of cognitive models

1125
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,119
but what's really important is that the

1126
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:08,520
cognitive models that we build

1127
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,099
are going to have tractable ways to do

1128
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:12,720
inference on them

1129
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,098
because of message passing

1130
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,380
so then they closed the chapter with

1131
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,500
this summary visualization so it's the

1132
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,119
three systems that we learned about in

1133
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,140
the chapter

1134
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,700
which is dot cortical column

1135
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,460
the balance between the indirect and the

1136
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,800
direct Pathways of policy selection in

1137
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,619
the basal ganglia midbrain

1138
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,200
and the action

1139
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,300
selection in that continuous time model

1140
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,359
happening via the spinal cord

1141
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:47,220
discrepancy detection

1142
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,140
and so this is kind of

1143
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,420
reflective and compatible with the

1144
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,480
actual anatomical connectivity

1145
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,940
of the body so it's not like proposing a

1146
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,760
telepathic link between some cell in the

1147
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,800
brain and like the motor

1148
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,960
uh unit in the arm

1149
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,900
so it's compatible with the constraints

1150
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,839
that exist in the body

1151
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,059
it explains and predicts different

1152
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:13,800
phenomena

1153
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,859
that are observed

1154
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,740
and those explanations come not from

1155
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,839
just trivial well if two things that are

1156
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,180
touching are influenced then one

1157
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,460
influences the other but rather with

1158
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,099
actually these statistical models

1159
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,680
that even help us understand the

1160
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,119
progression or different kinds of

1161
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,180
interventions in different conditions

1162
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,440
which is where these models have been

1163
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,839
used most

1164
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,760
so that's the end of that

1165
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,559
chapter five

1166
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,720
but they kind of close

1167
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,760
with um

1168
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,040
a reminder that like Neuroscience is a

1169
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,319
work in progress

1170
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,119
and

1171
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,640
um there are so many

1172
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,020
open

1173
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,119
questions

1174
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,540
from the super cellular level

1175
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,460
like where are the glia where's the

1176
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,980
immuno aspect

1177
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,819
to different kinds of everything

1178
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,579
they're just picking three examples

1179
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,440
that have been studied in previous

1180
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,839
papers by these authors

1181
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:22,020
and showing how alone

1182
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,319
and in combination we can use these

1183
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,420
kinds of models

1184
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,280
so Jana asked

1185
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,680
so this is how sensory experiences can

1186
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,098
be modeled

1187
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,500
broadly

1188
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,880
this

1189
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,700
could help us make sense of sensory

1190
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,040
experience this isn't like the one and

1191
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,720
only way to model sensory experience

1192
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:49,559
this is like one circuit board

1193
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,680
statistical model

1194
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,578
that can

1195
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,819
help with understanding how incoming

1196
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,200
proprioception

1197
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,640
results in outgoing action

1198
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,640
so it can be used in service of

1199
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,400
understanding sensory experience

1200
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,819
but this is not the the final model on

1201
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,319
sensory experience I hope that that's

1202
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,558
clear

1203
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,440
there can be other compositions yes

1204
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:31,440
so

1205
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,780
any other

1206
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,540
thoughts or comments on this first pass

1207
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,619
through five Michael

1208
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,520
yeah but in this figure 5.5 that you

1209
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,520
just showed uh is still the observation

1210
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,740
the sensation is actually missing there

1211
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,579
right

1212
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,559
so we have action but not the

1213
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,359
observation

1214
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:56,640
um here the input Y is the

1215
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,859
proprioceptive input

1216
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,559
but other kinds like visual input is not

1217
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,040
shown here

1218
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,540
but that is that speaks to the

1219
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,819
composability of these models

1220
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:12,240
is like we could have an auditory stream

1221
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,000
and a visual stream and a proprioceptive

1222
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,839
stream

1223
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,700
and we can do model comparison and we

1224
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,760
can develop models that use any mixtures

1225
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,260
of those

1226
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,660
and on given computational hardware for

1227
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,940
a given data set for a given setting for

1228
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,520
a given client one of those models might

1229
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,859
be more useful than the other for you

1230
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,180
okay thank you yeah it's a fun chapter

1231
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,339
and I it's definitely a context switch

1232
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:47,400
because chapter four just goes so hard

1233
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,800
with the technical details

1234
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,040
and then 5.3 is really like about our

1235
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,380
bodies

1236
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,200
but in that contrast there's been a lot

1237
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,200
of great discussion so

1238
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,880
um next week we'll return for the second

1239
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,220
discussion on five

1240
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,680
please feel free to ask your questions

1241
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,500
in the meanwhile so thank you everybody

1242
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,119
see you next time
