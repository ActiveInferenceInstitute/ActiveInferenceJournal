1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,840
hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,379
it's March 1st 2023

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,420
we're in cohort three

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,880
and we are having our first discussion

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,299
today on chapter three

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,920
chapter three

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,039
um is the high road to active inference

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,600
previously in chapter two we talked

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,539
about the low road and today we're

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,080
talking about the high road

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,480
those two roads are laid out in figure

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,960
1.2 we took it from Bayes theorem to

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,239
active inference in chapter two and

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,860
chapter three is going to be starting

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,140
from the free energy principle and also

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,739
taking us to octave inference so before

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,739
we go through the chapter or look at any

18
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,340
questions does anyone want to just give

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,480
any reflection or thought

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,039
what was

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,800
some experience they had in reading

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,180
chapter 3

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,180
or a quote or an idea

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,100
or something that stood out for them

25
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
you can raise your hand or just go for

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,040
it

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
okay so feel free to raise your hand or

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,299
write in the chat if you ever want to

29
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,619
add anything

30
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,640
um

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,799
chapter three takes a different attack

32
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,230
than chapter two

33
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,200
[Music]

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,939
anyone want anything or we'll we'll

35
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:57,899
start

36
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,079
exploring through the chapter and then

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,479
coming to the questions that people have

38
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,939
raised

39
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,799
um today or in the next week

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,859
okay

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,180
um

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,000
we'll move through chapter three

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
hopefully

44
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,319
relatively quickly

45
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,660
to get to the first of the questions and

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,819
then we'll have seeded some questions

47
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,700
for coming to our discussion next week

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,840
so in section 3.1

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,580
in chapter 2

50
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,379
free energy was motivated as a bound

51
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,260
in a way that we can do approximate

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,420
Bayesian inference

53
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,280
coming from the low road to active

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,379
inference and you can do free energy

55
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,680
based or energy-based methods like a

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,780
variational autoencoder you could do

57
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,060
that on any Bayesian statistical problem

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,420
at all and it's used commonly

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,819
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's

60
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,780
connected to action selection at all

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,540
in chapter 3 they're going to start from

62
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,040
The High Road

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,620
which is this Central imperative that

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,560
organisms or really just things

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
must maintain their existence

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,060
which is going to be operationalized in

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,400
a way that's compatible with the

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,379
surprise minimization that was brought

69
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,060
up in chapter two

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,400
and just like in Chapter 2 where free

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,040
energy was proposed as a way to bound

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,019
surprise which is like what we would

73
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,760
really want to know

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,980
coming from the high road we also want

75
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,739
to bound surprise and it turns out that

76
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,659
minimization of free energy is again

77
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,560
going to appear as a computational

78
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,299
computationally tractable solution to

79
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,599
the problem

80
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,560
the chapter is going to describe the

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,299
formal equivalence between the

82
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,159
minimization of variational free energy

83
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,060
and maximization of model evidence or

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,019
self-evidencing in Bayesian inference

85
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,180
and then active inference is going to be

86
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,340
brought up because we're going to head

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,739
into chapter 4 which is going to be all

88
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,659
about the generative models at the heart

89
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,798
of active inference

90
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,639
active inference is about how organisms

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,860
or adaptive systems maintain their

92
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,620
existence by minimizing surprise

93
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,740
via more proximally this tractable proxy

94
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,120
variational free energy

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
and the two ways to minimize variational

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,699
free energy are perception and action

97
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,820
change your mind change the world

98
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,560
integrated imperative

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,620
that supports this unifying perspective

100
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,000
on systems

101
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,860
high road is going to start from the

102
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,880
premise

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,280
that any living organism or any

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,860
persistently observed thing

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,139
has to maintain itself in a set of

106
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,639
preferred States

107
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,460
if it doesn't maintain itself in a set

108
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,340
of expected slash preferred States it

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,719
just isn't that kind of thing

110
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,100
that is going to apply to everything

111
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,960
from an oil droplet

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,060
that's diffusing or not

113
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,440
to

114
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,160
more sophisticated cognitive goals

115
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,759
humans physiological entities have to

116
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,940
stay within their physiological ranges

117
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,699
in reward learning it might be proposed

118
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,919
that there's this value function where

119
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,820
acceptable ranges are more rewarding

120
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,520
and then rewarding Paths of action would

121
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,039
be selected in contrast in active

122
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,000
inference

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,639
we establish the expectations around

124
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
those physiological variables in terms

125
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
of a preference and then we reduce our

126
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,639
surprise about realizing those

127
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,100
preferences slash expectations

128
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,320
that allows us to take the most likely

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,940
course of action

130
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,979
to maintain being the kind of thing we

131
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,979
are rather than proposing this reward

132
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,780
function and then asking what's the most

133
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,240
rewarding outcome

134
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,000
foreign

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,039
active inference cast the biological

136
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,740
problem of or explanation for survival

137
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,560
as surprise minimization

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,860
surely that will spur many conversations

139
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,979
but for now this is not like surprise

140
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,860
birthday minimization so this isn't to

141
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,080
say that surprise doesn't happen or that

142
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,060
cognitive surprise is not even sought

143
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,240
after actively in certain cases this is

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,819
referring to the statistical concept of

145
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,199
surprise

146
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,960
which is defined for a very specific

147
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,460
generative model

148
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,440
so not just surprise in general but for

149
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,240
a given generative model

150
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,240
at whatever level it's constructed at

151
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,340
surprise minimization

152
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,160
is what leads to the maximization of

153
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,020
model evidence because if you can

154
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,560
minimize surprise or the tractable proxy

155
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,720
of variational free energy

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,479
your model will basically be as fit as

157
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,840
it can be

158
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,460
against any

159
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,440
thoughts or just raise your hand and we

160
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,199
can take it anyway

161
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,180
3.2

162
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,759
mark off blankets

163
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,199
does anyone want to just give a

164
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,780
preemptive thought on Marco blankets or

165
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,300
anything else Jonathan go for it

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,280
sorry it's actually with with respect to

167
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,039
the to the surprise and and this is sort

168
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,960
of with respect to some preference

169
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,479
distribution over the the status of the

170
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,039
um of the agent

171
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:44,880
um

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,160
presumably does the agent have to have

173
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,440
any awareness of that preference

174
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,720
distribution itself and can the

175
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,460
preference distribution itself be

176
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,740
something which is inferred

177
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,539
um you know we may infer something about

178
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,720
our our preferred States

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,000
um you know uh is there a sort of

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,840
hierarchy to that as well

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
nice questions does anyone want to give

182
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,660
a first thought does the agent need

183
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,759
awareness of preference and can

184
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,840
preferences be learned

185
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,699
okay just first passes uh Ali go for

186
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,099
uh yeah actually I believe uh it can be

187
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,599
modeled

188
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,300
um in a kind of uh nested hierarchical

189
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,740
way so that uh the agent can be aware of

190
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,320
the aware of its own preferences and

191
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,659
also preferences uh is not uh static at

192
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,779
all and they can be dynamic as well and

193
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,260
can be learned and updated

194
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,740
great exactly if the model

195
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,800
does have a higher nested level

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,940
that

197
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,040
enables the interpretation of awareness

198
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,620
on preferences sure

199
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,880
in the base model no no awareness

200
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,720
attention phenomenology qualia is ever

201
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,120
implied at the bazel level so it doesn't

202
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,440
have to be but you could make a model

203
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,779
that has that feature can preferences be

204
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,740
learned again in the most simple case no

205
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,860
the C Vector is fixed however there have

206
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,040
been several works by Sajid at all and

207
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,160
others on preference learning

208
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,620
will

209
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,360
oh I feel like you said most of what I

210
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,100
was just about to say just that you know

211
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,980
thinking at the level of a bacterium you

212
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,000
know awareness is a a tricky concept but

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,980
um clearly there is an embedding of

214
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,740
these preferences in in you know some

215
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,600
information at whatever level we're

216
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,399
talking about

217
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,120
um

218
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,100
and yeah talking about learning

219
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,620
preferences you know perhaps at the

220
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,560
highest level those don't really change

221
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
but if you're talking about lower level

222
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,100
preferences

223
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,500
um those are kind of adapted to to the

224
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
individual uh time span like the

225
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,180
bacteria may not

226
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,279
um kind of change its Behavior overall

227
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,000
on on the on a lifespan but uh you know

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,740
given an individual couple of minutes

229
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,720
it's going to say oh I prefer to go left

230
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,220
versus right because of the chemical

231
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,700
gradient

232
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,459
great yes so

233
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,060
a preference slash expectation for being

234
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,940
in the Run versus the tumble mode of

235
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,140
movements

236
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,060
is happening faster and might be

237
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,360
learnable or updatable whereas a slower

238
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
updating process of for example whether

239
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,640
sugar is preferred at all might be

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,740
happening at a different time scale

241
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,839
um ever and Francois

242
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,839
yes I'm also thinking about Michael

243
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,279
Levin's work you had him on one of your

244
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,800
um episode former episodes where he's

245
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,560
talking about basal cognition

246
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
and that there's maybe even something

247
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,500
like nowhere of preferences at the very

248
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,220
very lowest level

249
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,200
cool

250
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,920
thank you Francois and then Jonathan

251
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,339
and the example that that will said that

252
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,339
you know lower level preferences could

253
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,459
could change like moving left or right

254
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,800
for the bacterium

255
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,959
how do we know if that's a preference or

256
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,820
not just like it's re-evaluating

257
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,800
different policies that would lead to

258
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,319
different expected free Energies

259
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,519
yeah it's a great question

260
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,940
if we don't Define the system like it's

261
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,120
not a system that we created then it

262
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,220
would be an empirical question whether

263
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,660
the data support a model in which you

264
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,480
have a fixed preference

265
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,620
with oscillating policy selection based

266
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,800
upon expected free energy calculations

267
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,160
or whether there are behavior that seems

268
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,760
to go beyond that to actually capture

269
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,079
uh a plastic C

270
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,399
so it's an empirical question from a

271
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,320
given data set and from a given

272
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,779
generative model

273
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,640
because we can easily imagine and just

274
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,519
speak out both of those examples and so

275
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,200
it's like a portfolio of models and then

276
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,760
we would do model selection or

277
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,500
evaluation amongst those alternative

278
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,160
strategies

279
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,440
um Jonathan and then Evert

280
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,899
yeah I mean is there some

281
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,279
um some way of thinking about it that

282
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,680
there's always going to be a hierarchy

283
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,720
that there is simply a preference for

284
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,820
survival

285
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,519
within within any model like that that

286
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,260
um you know the agent is trying to

287
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,139
retain its thickness

288
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,260
um and from that maybe glucose levels

289
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
and temperature and you know what

290
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,800
whatever else it may be but each of

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,880
those is a preference in sort of uh

292
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,120
in order to have this macro preference

293
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,079
which is simply survival

294
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,380
that's a great way to put it over

295
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,180
intra and especially intergenerational

296
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,339
time scales

297
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,560
you're only going to ever see things

298
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,740
that at least act that way or appear

299
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,880
that way

300
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,680
that's kind of like the good regulator

301
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,139
theorem from cybernetics

302
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,139
so yeah at some point

303
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,639
it can be said that there's this

304
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,800
implicit

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,860
pervasive preference

306
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,139
for persistence

307
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,180
otherwise you just wouldn't be even

308
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,120
observing that system to be anyway at

309
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,300
all

310
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
ever

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,300
yeah would you say there's a difference

312
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,959
between preferences and

313
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,660
goal directed Behavior

314
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,300
it's a great question in fact goal is

315
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,639
not used in the active inference

316
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,920
ontology we can definitely talk

317
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,680
informally about like

318
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,380
well the preference is to be on Square

319
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,860
three comma 3 in the grid world so just

320
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,079
Loosely speaking its goal is to make it

321
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,880
to three comma three

322
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,660
but we don't need to appeal to goals as

323
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,380
a formal construct nor reward

324
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,779
so

325
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,220
conversationally it's totally fair to

326
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,920
talk about uh agentic or goal directed

327
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,779
Behavior

328
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,240
the way that that's being

329
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,360
operationalized in active inference is

330
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,139
through this preference vector

331
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,519
um

332
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,920
thanks Scott um always might be off

333
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
there are presumably bad Regulators

334
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,220
which maintain themselves by luck and

335
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,860
bad Regulators which will lose their

336
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,260
homeostasis imminently yes

337
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,139
totally agreed with that luck is only

338
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,220
going to go

339
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,620
so far and so long

340
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,800
and the fact that the imperative is for

341
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,380
adaptive regulation doesn't mean there

342
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,399
aren't systems that fail

343
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,979
ever

344
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,380
this is probably also related to what we

345
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,279
discussed before and as if talk that the

346
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,920
agent looks as if it's minimizing this

347
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,699
or that or it looks as if it's pursuing

348
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,560
a certain goal

349
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,279
um

350
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,699
would you say that's right

351
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,920
yes as if or perhaps a synonym for as if

352
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,699
could be modeled as or I could publish a

353
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,339
paper modeling it as

354
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,980
as a very um

355
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,920
uh defined way of talking about as if I

356
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
can imagine it

357
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,459
or it could be written that or one could

358
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,800
model that

359
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,500
and that puts us more squarely in the

360
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,620
instrumentalist perspective or just the

361
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,060
imaginative perspective

362
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,320
so awesome comments

363
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,720
great

364
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,860
so

365
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,940
from

366
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,339
surprised with respect oh um I'll ego

367
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,459
for it

368
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,100
uh yeah I just wanted to point out uh

369
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,399
perhaps we can talk about gold-directed

370
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,579
motion as a kind of uh emergent uh

371
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,420
phenomena that arises from this

372
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,079
um

373
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,220
energy minimization mechanism so it's

374
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,120
not by itself an objective parameter

375
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,619
that we need to describe or model it's

376
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,579
just uh it can be

377
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,679
seen or described as an emergent

378
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,240
phenomenon of that mechanism

379
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,980
awesome

380
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,079
and I just uh Everett go for it sorry I

381
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,159
just had to like re-share my screen

382
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm sorry I had sorry for my handset all

383
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,500
right

384
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,919
okay

385
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,919
um

386
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,179
okay

387
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,640
so continuing on with Section 3.2

388
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,520
mark off blankets

389
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,740
big topic

390
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,400
in the field

391
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,900
the way that

392
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,120
things are going to be modeled or framed

393
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,080
is in terms of their relative insulation

394
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,539
from the environment

395
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,780
the generative process the environment

396
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,120
and the relative insulation with the

397
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,460
generative model or the agent the

398
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,620
particular States

399
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,480
in the absence of the separation there

400
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,059
would be no surprise to minimize there

401
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,799
must be something to be surprised and

402
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,160
something to be surprised about

403
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,340
Unity is plural at minimum two

404
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,260
in other words there are at least two

405
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,600
things system and environment and these

406
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
can be disambiguated from one another

407
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
these can be modeled as being

408
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,200
disambiguated from one another

409
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,080
a formal way to express that separation

410
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
is the statistical construct of a Markov

411
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,039
blanket

412
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,039
which can be traced to the work of Judea

413
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,400
Pearl on Bayesian graphs and causal

414
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,860
inference

415
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,120
here

416
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,480
is box 3.1 with a technical definition

417
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,900
of a Markov blanket

418
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,080
a Markov blanket in brief they write is

419
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,179
a set of variables that mediate all

420
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,220
statistical interactions between a

421
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,460
system and its environment so Markov

422
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,320
blankets are nodes one or more nodes on

423
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
a Bayesian graph

424
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,840
for which two other sets of nodes are

425
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,820
conditionally independent

426
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,100
so if person a says something to person

427
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,320
B and B says something to C

428
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,140
it's like person B is the blanket

429
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,820
between a and C

430
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,740
so it isn't the internal external States

431
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,440
can't influence each other but rather

432
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
it's that their engagements with each

433
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,620
other are mediated through the blankets

434
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,500
and um just earlier

435
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,380
uh it's in chapter nine we had a really

436
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,360
great discussion about the map territory

437
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,059
fallacy and the map territory fallacy

438
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,260
fallacy

439
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,500
and for now just to sort of see this

440
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,179
discussion and continue

441
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,400
um the movement

442
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,460
Markov blankets exist for generative

443
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,220
models because Markov blankets are a

444
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,860
feature of Bayesian graphs so the world

445
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,740
the territory does not have Markov

446
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
blankets

447
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,260
however

448
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,200
Maps can have Markov blankets

449
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,620
and a huge amount of

450
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,299
well intended

451
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,960
and off-key discussion

452
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,400
has lost touch with that map territory

453
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,740
distinction Markov blankets are about

454
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,760
Maps

455
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,740
because we're talking about partition

456
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,980
States on a base graph

457
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,039
the claim is not that the real world

458
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,620
consists of labeled

459
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,740
things that have internal external sense

460
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,679
and action on them

461
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,480
and then just one more point and again

462
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,220
feel free to raise your hand or anything

463
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,580
in the discussions of pearl

464
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,059
the Markov blanket is this insulating

465
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,160
set of nodes

466
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,000
what friston and collaborators have done

467
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
in the previous two decades or so

468
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,620
is

469
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,900
further partition

470
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,320
that undirected Markov blanket into two

471
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,880
types of notes

472
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,760
nodes with incoming dependencies

473
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,400
which are interpreted as sensory States

474
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,559
and nodes with outgoing dependencies

475
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,460
which are active States

476
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,919
that licensed the use of the Markov

477
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,740
blankets to describe the statistical

478
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,740
boundaries of an Adaptive or cybernetic

479
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,299
agents

480
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,140
so the Markov blanket concept itself is

481
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,580
undirected

482
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,740
it just describes the insulating set of

483
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,059
nodes

484
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,940
friston at all operationalized it

485
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,419
further to bring it into the setting of

486
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,059
cognitive modeling

487
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,299
so now we revisit

488
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,460
that particular partition

489
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,480
that previously was shown as a feedback

490
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,120
loop with perception and cognition and

491
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,080
action

492
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
and now it's going to be shown in a way

493
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,520
that's going to be taking us closer to

494
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,860
the Bayesian mechanics or the particular

495
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,200
partition which is we have the blanket

496
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,539
which is shown here according to the the

497
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,299
friston blanket approach active states

498
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,600
with outgoing statistical dependencies

499
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,640
sensory states with incoming statistical

500
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,020
dependencies

501
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,140
internal states don't have a direct Edge

502
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,539
to external States so there's no

503
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,159
telekinesis

504
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,200
and there's no telepathy

505
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,780
however internal states can select

506
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,280
actions

507
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,620
that modify how the external World

508
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,360
changes

509
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,179
that influences which sensory states are

510
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,640
observed which is interpreted through

511
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,760
perceptions learning by internal States

512
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,240
so consequences percolate throughout the

513
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,740
entire partition

514
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,380
but there's no direct connections

515
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,620
between external and internal States Ali

516
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,840
uh yeah I just wanted to quickly point

517
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,980
out

518
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,179
um about two issues here one of which is

519
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,940
um I think an important error in this

520
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,980
figure uh because uh well we know that

521
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,120
the flow of active States uh wouldn't

522
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,280
um

523
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,919
depend on the external States and

524
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,080
similarly the flow of the internal

525
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,320
sensory States wouldn't will not depend

526
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,860
on the internal state so in the

527
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,880
equations in that figure X and Y should

528
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,179
be interchanged yeah that's it and the

529
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,620
other one is

530
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,919
of course to emphasize my favorite

531
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,820
definition of markup blanket which is

532
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,419
the uh it's a kind of boundary or

533
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,659
interface in state space so it's not

534
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,260
necessarily a spatial temporal boundary

535
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,980
although uh in some cases it might

536
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,679
manifest itself as a spatial temporal

537
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,159
boundary such as the membranes of cells

538
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,520
or organelles or whatever

539
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,340
great way to say it the markout blanket

540
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,640
is the boundary in the statistical State

541
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,940
space okay so

542
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,919
um I'm just gonna add some of these

543
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,020
questions uh Jonathan I'm just adding it

544
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,400
to the chapter three questions and we'll

545
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,360
we'll

546
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,559
um come to it

547
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
I'm just having this weird thing with

548
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,080
like

549
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,559
freezing of my screen

550
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,620
um and

551
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,539
than ever

552
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,820
yeah I just posted the link in the chat

553
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,980
I don't know if it's possible to open

554
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,000
the page yes

555
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,179
but because there isn't a picture a

556
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,440
little bit down

557
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
I think that's also a mark of blanket

558
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,039
that's shown there but there are more

559
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,340
um more arrows than in the one that you

560
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,220
just showed in the textbook

561
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,179
a little bit lower

562
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,059
yeah so if you and I wonder yeah so I

563
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,520
wonder no it's not that one okay which

564
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,140
page

565
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,170
oh I have a look

566
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,849
[Music]

567
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,139
uh it's on page

568
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,880
let's figure one

569
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,360
okay I'm gonna have to reshare again

570
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,719
sorry

571
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
um

572
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,980
okay I hope that this is a little bit

573
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,900
more stable

574
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,460
um

575
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,960
the the

576
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,559
um

577
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,659
uh well just

578
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,440
a few possible comments any base graph

579
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,220
is going to have a multitude of Markov

580
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,900
blankets Markov blankets are not

581
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,299
uniquely identifying like agent

582
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,520
environment boundaries but those are

583
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,080
some boundaries in state space that

584
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,380
we're interested in but every base graph

585
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,419
that isn't fully connected so if there's

586
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,100
any nodes that aren't connected to other

587
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,720
nodes they will have a Marcon blanket so

588
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,059
the concept is actually less

589
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,240
philosophically and even semantically

590
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,059
loaded than people often expect any base

591
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,340
graph you just draw on a piece of paper

592
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,080
if there's some node that intermediates

593
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,820
two other sets of nodes

594
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,100
it's a markup blanket it does not

595
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,460
identify cybernetic system boundaries

596
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,260
so

597
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,299
with respect to the cybernetic system

598
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,700
boundary though which is one kind of

599
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
base graph that we care about

600
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,279
the work of Aguilera at all how

601
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,159
particular is the free energy principle

602
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,659
um

603
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,620
has explored different topologies of the

604
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,960
particular partition

605
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,179
for example like what if you do or don't

606
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,740
have this Edge between active and

607
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,080
sensory States why is there an arrow

608
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,260
going from action back to internal why

609
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,120
is there an arrow going from sense back

610
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,620
to external

611
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,779
the first answer on this

612
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,020
is that this is a statistical model so

613
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,320
just because you're enabling that edge

614
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,760
doesn't mean that the data are going to

615
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,220
support that edge having a non-zero

616
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,779
parameterization

617
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,279
so just describing the possibilities

618
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,659
that are going to get parameterized so

619
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,580
it's not a claim about the real world

620
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,039
#map territory it's just saying this is

621
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,279
the class of models that were fitting

622
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,480
um

623
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,460
so in practice

624
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,039
it means less

625
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,400
than it may seem however it's also the

626
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,380
case that what constraints we put on

627
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,620
this topology do end up influencing

628
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,620
greatly what kinds of models we fit

629
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,100
Michael

630
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,020
yeah I have a question on page 43 under

631
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,260
this box it says

632
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,000
illustrates the interpretation of marker

633
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,880
blanket in a dynamic setting and then

634
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,940
the sentence here the conditional

635
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,559
independencies have been supplemented

636
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,679
with dynamical constraints so that the

637
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,100
flow do not depend on states on the

638
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,679
opposite opposite side of the blanket so

639
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,659
can you elaborate what that means and

640
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,620
what this implies uh What uh dynamical

641
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,440
constraints in contrast to

642
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,100
what else

643
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,880
the the dynamical constraints are the

644
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,880
dynamical equations that are provided

645
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,179
for the rates of change of each of these

646
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,260
and again note what um what Ali has

647
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,140
brought up in and written in the chat

648
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,960
um there there's just a slight error

649
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,020
with the the variables as written

650
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,260
so where it says that U Dot

651
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,200
so that's like action States

652
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,380
it says that it's a function of X U and

653
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,620
Y

654
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,299
however

655
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,480
um it should be mu U and Y

656
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,580
because this would suggest that octave

657
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,580
states do depend on external States when

658
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,039
actually this x should be a mu

659
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,220
which is to say that active States

660
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,120
are a function of internal States

661
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,980
sensory states and their own current

662
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,480
position

663
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,059
that doesn't mean that they're all equal

664
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,240
contributors it's empirical with your

665
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,000
data set and your generative model

666
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,980
and you can imagine situations where

667
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,299
it's only the internal state that

668
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,039
matters or it's only the sensory state

669
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,919
that matters this is just like the space

670
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,620
in which models are fit from

671
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,419
this isn't to Claim about

672
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,200
any specific cybernetic system or any

673
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,120
interpretation of the real world

674
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,899
octopus

675
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,880
uh how so x-star indicates that you're

676
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,159
dealing with continuous time Dynamics

677
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,539
right

678
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,779
correct these are flows on the variables

679
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,960
Okay so

680
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,620
um I'm having a tough time mapping this

681
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,700
is there any disjunction or any

682
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,539
difficulty with things that are

683
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:06,360
inherently discrete

684
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,140
uh like I love cellular automata and

685
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,720
any discrete agent-based model can be

686
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
can be put in a cellular automaton

687
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,600
framework but there's no way to really

688
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,799
I mean you can I guess you can

689
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,380
interpolate it somehow but it's not a

690
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,059
natural way of thinking about it so is

691
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,559
continuous time essential to this

692
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,100
framework or is it just a convenient

693
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,580
much of the textbook thank you octopus

694
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,100
is about the differences and

695
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,559
similarities between discrete time and

696
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,840
continuous time formalizations so just

697
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,140
to give a quick preview figure 4.3 shows

698
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,820
on the top The partially observable

699
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,240
Markov decision process discrete time

700
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,520
discrete State space formalization and

701
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,260
the bottom is the continuous time

702
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,539
formalization which is more like a

703
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,760
Taylor series approximation using the

704
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,740
generalized coordinates of motion

705
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,159
and then chapter 7 focuses on the

706
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,380
discrete time generative models chapter

707
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,500
8 focuses on the continuous time models

708
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,460
and in figure 8.6 there's a nested

709
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,919
hierarchical model where the lower level

710
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
is continuous time

711
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,620
and the higher level is discrete time

712
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,760
so

713
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,860
generative models can be either discrete

714
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,919
or continuous State spaces time or other

715
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,659
variables

716
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:28,860
um

717
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,899
uh Jonathan wrote presumably in reality

718
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,700
all these variables are high dimensional

719
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,460
vectors for sure it could be as simple

720
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,100
as a scalar a single number or it could

721
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,020
be an n-dimensional tensor

722
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,520
ever yeah thanks octopus efforts are

723
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,960
Henry's or or anyone else

724
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,059
no I didn't have my hands okay it was

725
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:57,440
just my zoom was locking okay

726
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,419
3.2

727
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,840
is going to give an intuition for what

728
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,220
it means when we have this um

729
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,039
a simple system with mu

730
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,840
internal x external and B blanket States

731
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,580
so we can imagine that we're sampling

732
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,640
from this Cube X Y and Z but it's mu B

733
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,159
and uh and X

734
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,700
and then these three panels

735
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,299
are X conditioned on B mu conditioned on

736
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,940
B and then finally the relationship

737
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,279
between X and mu

738
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,500
and so this shows that you could

739
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,059
estimate

740
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,460
X

741
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,000
conditioned upon an expectation of mu

742
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,299
given B so internal States

743
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,000
given blanket States that's like

744
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,559
cognition

745
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,860
about X so here's my estimate my

746
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,899
posterior probability estimate of X

747
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,840
which I'm not directly observing

748
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,880
conditioned upon

749
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,159
my expectations

750
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,560
of internal States conditioned on B

751
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,080
and so you can have a relationship

752
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,879
between X and B

753
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,399
like there's some correlation between

754
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,320
external and blanket States some

755
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,760
correlation between the temperature in

756
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,918
the room and your thermometer

757
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,480
and then there's some correlation

758
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,760
between your cognitive States and the

759
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,780
blanket

760
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,359
if your beliefs about temperature given

761
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,859
the thermometer

762
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,040
and then that results

763
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,739
in there being a an information

764
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,260
relationship between external and

765
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,540
internal States though they are only

766
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,520
mediated through the blanket

767
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,379
measurements

768
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,199
this is just an inference passive

769
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,940
setting there's no action coming into

770
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,000
play yet it's just to get a bit of an

771
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,540
intuition about how a Markov blanket

772
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,420
mediated perceptual inference occurs

773
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,500
3.3 surprise minimization and

774
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,940
self-evidency

775
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,119
so an agent with Markov blanket appears

776
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,520
to model the external environment

777
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,079
in the sense that internal States

778
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,720
correspond on average to a probabilistic

779
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,220
representation

780
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,859
of external states of the system

781
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:31,079
figure 3.2 that's what that was showing

782
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:31,800
um

783
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,900
importantly the agent's generative model

784
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,079
cannot simply mimic external Dynamics

785
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,000
otherwise the agent would simply follow

786
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,200
external dissipative Dynamics so passive

787
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,640
inference

788
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,240
might lead one to want a model where we

789
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
simply

790
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,839
estimate external States as well as we

791
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,020
can we just learn optimally

792
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,260
and just sit and watch the show

793
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,599
rather the model must also specify the

794
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,280
preferred conditions for the agent's

795
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,720
existence

796
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,000
or the regions of states that the agent

797
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,579
has to visit to maintain its existence

798
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,640
or satisfy criteria for its existence in

799
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,339
terms of occupying characteristic States

800
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,119
so if we want to do more than just watch

801
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,220
if we want to act

802
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,359
to bound our surprise and improve our

803
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,700
persistence in a dissipative far from

804
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,680
equilibrium environments

805
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,079
we need to have some preferences or

806
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,040
expectations that actions can be

807
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,900
selected

808
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,180
based upon how they will realize those

809
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,680
preferences Francois

810
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,619
yeah sorry I think we kind of skipped

811
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,540
over something but I didn't really

812
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,820
understand we want to ask about

813
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,160
um is that

814
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,980
the thing about the the Symmetry across

815
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,560
the market plan Mark of blanket and the

816
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,800
consequences of this being weakened

817
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,099
um associate pairs of expected internal

818
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,320
and external states with each other I

819
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,119
really don't understand how that

820
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,040
consequence comes from the Symmetry

821
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,740
question mark of blanket could

822
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,280
and could you explain it better

823
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,480
in a different way

824
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,020
sure there's more

825
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,420
um angles let's just say first starting

826
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,020
with a homeostatic angle let's just say

827
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,320
that temperature really is relevant for

828
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,460
survival

829
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,079
so the color of the room doesn't matter

830
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,500
for survival but the temperature matters

831
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,660
and we have a thermometer so that's our

832
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,800
Markov blanket and we're going to be

833
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,760
getting some

834
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,040
proxied information about temperature

835
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,180
through our thermometer

836
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,339
without going too deep into debates

837
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,980
about representationalism

838
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,079
there must be something in the

839
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,900
generative model the agent the cognitive

840
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,460
model of the agents

841
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,540
that represents that temperature there

842
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,420
has to be some mapping

843
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,800
between

844
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,339
the temperature in the room unobserved

845
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,020
and the agent's perception of

846
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,700
temperature such that it's able to

847
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,560
engage adaptively

848
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,660
otherwise it's just going to be a

849
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,180
particle adrift

850
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,940
so it turns out it doesn't need to have

851
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,700
an exact structural relationship

852
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,680
so temperature could be a continuous

853
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,680
variable and the agent's generative

854
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,660
model might just be too hot just right

855
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,359
or cold three states so I don't need to

856
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,660
have the same structure but there does

857
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,300
have to be a mapping

858
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
between decisions that influence vital

859
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,560
variables

860
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,640
and the external reality of those vital

861
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,619
variables so that's the homeostatic

862
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,359
angle and then just shortly the other

863
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,260
symmetry based angle is um the external

864
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,960
states don't have to be an active agent

865
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,359
but they could be this could be like a

866
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,760
Communications interface

867
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,160
in which case it would be fair to say

868
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,140
that the generative model performs

869
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,060
inference with an aboutness of the

870
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,420
generative process but also the process

871
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,660
as agent is doing inference on the

872
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,900
aboutness of the agent on the right side

873
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,660
so that has been more recently explored

874
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,640
with like a symmetry with a niche doing

875
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,920
inference on the organism

876
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,320
also through the same blanket

877
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,960
okay thank you that makes more sense

878
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,859
great so that um baking in of

879
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,440
preferences

880
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,440
or expectations

881
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,480
builds in what they call an implicit

882
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,760
optimism bias

883
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,720
which is like

884
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,420
steering our perception and action

885
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,420
towards realizing preferences about

886
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,700
observations

887
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,920
this optimism bias is necessary for the

888
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,140
agent to go beyond the mere duplication

889
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,960
of external Dynamics or resemblance of

890
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,180
external Dynamics

891
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,280
to prescribe active states that

892
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,900
underwrite its preferred or

893
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,800
characteristic States

894
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,359
one can cast optimal Behavior with

895
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,339
respect to Prior preferences

896
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,680
which again doesn't mean that it always

897
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,420
works doesn't mean everything always

898
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,000
lives all the time or that outcomes are

899
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,760
the best that they can ever possibly be

900
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,820
but given prior preferences

901
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,220
the maximization of model evidence by

902
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,740
perception is a signal processing

903
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,839
perspective that's like the optimal

904
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,960
reconstruction of some sound

905
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,540
however we have a unified imperative

906
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,460
that isn't just maximizing model

907
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,680
evidence for perception

908
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,960
we have a joint imperative for the

909
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,640
maximization of model evidence by

910
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,800
perception and action

911
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,960
we can reduce our surprise bound our

912
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,460
surprise

913
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,180
with minimizing variational free energy

914
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,980
minimizing expected free energy

915
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,320
which is a dual or unified imperative

916
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,839
that brings together changing your mind

917
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,000
through perception learning and changing

918
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,200
the world through action

919
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,880
um a good fit indicates the model

920
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,780
successfully accounts for Sensations

921
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,640
at the same time it realizes its

922
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
preferred sensation

923
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,680
given that they are less surprising

924
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,780
good description

925
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,000
good prescription

926
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,800
good scientist

927
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,079
good engineer

928
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,880
such a good fit is a guarantee of

929
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,460
surprise minimization as maximizing

930
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,599
model evidence P of Y the probability of

931
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,460
the data given the model

932
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,740
is mathematically equivalent to

933
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,700
minimizing surprise fancy I

934
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,700
negative natural log of the same

935
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,579
that is why you'll often hear adaptive

936
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,320
systems described as self-evidising

937
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,460
self-evidencing means acting to Garner

938
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,800
sensory data consistent with an internal

939
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,700
model

940
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,799
hence maximizing model evidence

941
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,960
surprise minimization as a hamiltonian

942
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,820
principle of least action

943
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,420
this is starting to

944
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,359
invoke

945
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,720
some more physics based approaches on

946
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,119
the low road we were squarely within

947
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,000
statistics Bayes theorem base theorem

948
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,880
with action active inference

949
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,160
coming from the free energy principle on

950
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,480
the high road

951
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,720
we have a lot more physics based views

952
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,339
so

953
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,800
expressing this as a physicist might

954
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,020
dot dot

955
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,000
this is like a ball rolling down a hill

956
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,920
from a high gravitational potential

957
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,200
energy at the top of the hill to low

958
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,240
energy in a basin

959
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,339
so just like in classical mechanics it

960
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,880
might describe a ball rolling down

961
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,800
an elevation landscape with respect to

962
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,900
potential energy

963
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,060
we're in an information geometric

964
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,300
landscape and the ball rolling down the

965
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,720
hill taking the path of least action

966
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,339
is going to be formally equivalent or at

967
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,579
least formally analogous to our belief

968
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,520
distributions rolling down the hill

969
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,760
with negative log evidence or surprise

970
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,280
playing the role of gravity

971
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,619
that is what is equivalent to potential

972
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:02,099
energy drawing the ball down the hill

973
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,280
and if you want a more technical angle

974
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,800
check out live stream 52 which will be

975
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,140
happening this week and next week

976
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,079
it is going to go a lot deeper into this

977
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,540
surprise as potential energy

978
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,540
interpretation

979
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,500
um

980
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,780
here's a path taken by a two-dimensional

981
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,599
random dynamical system

982
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,200
it's kind of vibrating but it is also

983
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,540
spending most of its time in the sensor

984
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,300
here

985
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,220
and the left one

986
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,680
another way to view like the landscape

987
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,859
that this pen was drawing on or that

988
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,800
this ball was rolling on is on the right

989
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,640
this is like a topo map

990
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,160
where here is like a plateau and then

991
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,359
it's like a bowl

992
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,280
so even though it started here it kind

993
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,900
of vibrated around but it spends most of

994
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,060
its time in the bottom of the bowl

995
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,319
in the middle

996
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,420
is a trajectory of a system

997
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,760
that has Dynamics bearing no

998
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,099
relationship to surprise

999
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,099
so here you have a uncorrelated just

1000
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,220
random walk Brownian diffusion

1001
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,359
inner particle

1002
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,040
more details and equations

1003
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,780
that connect

1004
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,720
minimization of entropy

1005
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,540
which is kind of like the

1006
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,839
um blurriness of a distribution like how

1007
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,160
broad or sharp it is

1008
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,980
has a relationship with the maximization

1009
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,280
of the probability of observations

1010
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,339
and also

1011
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:51,540
the expectation of self-information so

1012
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,220
ensuring that a small proportion of

1013
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,780
sensory states are occupied with high

1014
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,099
probability

1015
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:58,920
like we want a distribution on

1016
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,359
temperature States

1017
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:04,160
that's very sharp

1018
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,440
that is equivalent to bounding surprise

1019
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,319
about temperature yes and also

1020
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,420
maintaining a certain entropy on the

1021
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,740
temperature distribution

1022
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,660
Maria does anyone know if the random

1023
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,339
pattern in the middle is less or more

1024
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,920
common than the centered one Jonathan

1025
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,780
wrote it depends on the context totally

1026
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,880
agreed

1027
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,940
um

1028
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,119
you can add more details than that Maria

1029
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,380
but there are um sets of variables in in

1030
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,380
your imagination or in the world

1031
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,440
for whom their Dynamics look like that

1032
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,900
and there's sets that look like that and

1033
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,220
various other things in between

1034
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,119
um

1035
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,099
surprise minimization formalizes the

1036
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,740
idea of homeostasis

1037
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,000
uh Ali go for it

1038
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,280
uh yeah I think it might be useful to

1039
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,319
point out uh Paul Curry's

1040
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,339
the taxonomy of singular points because

1041
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:13,200
uh back in the 19th century he showed

1042
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,960
that uh singular points can have only

1043
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,380
four possible different types uh namely

1044
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,339
nodes saddle points Foci and centers but

1045
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,839
then he went out uh claiming that uh

1046
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,380
among those different types nodes saddle

1047
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,800
points and Foci are much more generic

1048
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,640
than Center so centers only arises in

1049
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,119
exceptional circumstances so

1050
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,440
yeah in almost all the physical systems

1051
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,560
that we model physical dynamical systems

1052
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,400
uh we will most likely encounter only

1053
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,260
those three kinds of singular points

1054
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,619
um and it's just very briefly uh nodes

1055
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,380
are the points through which an infinite

1056
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,720
number of solution curves pass saddle

1057
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,819
points are the points through which only

1058
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,480
two solution curves pass and Foci are

1059
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,520
the points which the solution curves

1060
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,079
approach in the manner of the

1061
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,920
logarithmic spiral and the centers are

1062
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,079
the points around which the solution

1063
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,579
curves are somehow Inc closed and

1064
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:29,060
enveloping one another

1065
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,339
great just really quickly to efforts

1066
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:37,680
uh question so this sensory active state

1067
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,720
notice that the notation is totally

1068
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,839
different so you got to take a fresh

1069
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:44,220
look at the notation every time like

1070
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,460
external states are Q Prime and so on

1071
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,900
um so m is a blanket M and Phi are

1072
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,760
blanket between q and E

1073
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,760
but also e and Omega are a blanket

1074
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,940
between q and M so mark all blankets are

1075
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,900
everywhere they do no philosophical work

1076
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,880
they're a purely technical description

1077
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,300
of nodes on a Bayesian graph

1078
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,760
maps have Markov blankets not

1079
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,099
territories it can be somewhat

1080
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,660
misleading when we have a picture of a

1081
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,280
brain as if we were describing it but

1082
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,839
it's like actually a map of the brain

1083
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:21,540
not the territory itself so brains don't

1084
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,060
have Markov blankets Maps do

1085
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,859
maps are made by people

1086
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,079
maps are made amongst portfolios of

1087
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,140
other maps and some of those Markov

1088
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,720
boundaries in Phase space

1089
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,300
can be identified with different

1090
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,339
functional phenomena

1091
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:39,900
but

1092
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,780
just drawing a base graph

1093
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,359
is not a prediction or an explanation by

1094
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,280
itself and so it doesn't do too much

1095
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,319
work

1096
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,300
yet a huge amount of discourse has

1097
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,359
focused on those types of topics ever

1098
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,780
yes do you do you agree that that's a

1099
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,119
big description of the Marco blanket

1100
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,359
that captures more uh maybe things that

1101
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,640
have

1102
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,480
been discussed in previous uh

1103
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,339
times about preferences and subjective

1104
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,660
feelings

1105
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,760
because I know that Mark songs has

1106
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,760
talked about precision as being related

1107
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,339
to the things that we consciously

1108
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:29,460
receive as feelings

1109
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,920
is that captured here in this picture do

1110
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,060
you see

1111
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,720
preferences are not shown here unless

1112
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,140
one uses preference as a subtype of

1113
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,500
internal State

1114
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,720
marks Holmes indeed has discussed

1115
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,760
extensively Precision affect

1116
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,520
Consciousness awareness and so on

1117
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,900
but

1118
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,880
in the end it comes down to just the

1119
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,440
full specification of the generative

1120
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,559
model what data and what phenomena are

1121
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,300
being tried to be explained by that

1122
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,359
model and data together and just drawing

1123
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,640
any kind of um

1124
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,200
diagram

1125
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,960
is just the beginning of a graphical

1126
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,359
abstract or a schema

1127
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:15,420
it's not an explanation prediction

1128
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,240
design imperative or control system

1129
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,259
it's just a drawing

1130
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,540
all right

1131
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,859
in our last

1132
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:26,520
um

1133
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,240
five minutes

1134
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,839
um

1135
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:33,119
topics really interesting

1136
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,859
so this is our first discussion on

1137
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,359
chapter three

1138
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,359
and we got about halfway through we're

1139
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,059
just going to peep ahead

1140
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,119
and then next week we will

1141
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,300
um pick up with the chapter three

1142
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,740
questions already there's a bunch of

1143
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,460
them

1144
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,540
so

1145
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,119
we've been talking about entropy

1146
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,440
self-suprisal model evidence

1147
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,500
maximization and their relationships

1148
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,880
3.4

1149
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,119
relations between or among depending on

1150
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,680
how you prefer your English

1151
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,260
inference cognition and stochastic

1152
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,980
Dynamics

1153
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,640
table 3.1 is going to juxtapose

1154
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,920
statistical physics

1155
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,660
Bayesian inference and information

1156
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,220
Theory

1157
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,160
and a cognitive interpretation

1158
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,619
where in rows

1159
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:28,440
there are going to be sort of

1160
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,839
three phases

1161
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
so across columns

1162
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,180
these three Fields as the authors are

1163
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,980
showing or talking about something

1164
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,380
that's basically like the same or

1165
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,700
resonant with

1166
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,920
box 3.2

1167
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,319
is talking about free energy in

1168
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:52,619
statistical physics and active inference

1169
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,660
they want to be clear that variational

1170
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,559
free energy which is a used commonly in

1171
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,940
machine learning

1172
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,540
is not necessarily referring to for

1173
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,819
example the Gibbs free energy the actual

1174
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:08,579
liberatable energy of the particles

1175
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:11,960
constituting that embodied entity

1176
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,059
3.4.1 variational free energy model

1177
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,980
evidence and surprise

1178
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,500
here surprise

1179
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,200
the information on the data given the

1180
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,280
model

1181
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,240
is the negative log of model evidence

1182
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,540
and model evidence is always less than

1183
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,059
the variational free energy which we'll

1184
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,839
go into more

1185
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,760
3.42 expected free energy and inference

1186
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,680
of most likely trajectories so

1187
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,720
variational free energy is real time

1188
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,240
it's about the model right now and the

1189
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,680
data right now

1190
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,500
expected free energy is going to be

1191
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,980
about likely courses of actions action

1192
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,079
sequences are called policies

1193
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,140
and that's going to entail the

1194
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,700
description of observations that haven't

1195
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,339
actually happened yet

1196
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,819
Jack

1197
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,140
oh yeah I just wanted to ask a question

1198
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,540
regarding the distinction between Gibbs

1199
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,579
free energy and variational free energy

1200
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:15,420
as you just mentioned in box 3.2 so

1201
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,640
um is this just a metaphor between the

1202
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,980
two like an analogy or is there a

1203
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,960
mathematical like relationship that we

1204
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,559
can write down between gives free energy

1205
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,700
helmholes for energy and variational

1206
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,099
free energy

1207
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,660
um

1208
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,319
yes there are formal relationships among

1209
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,099
them

1210
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,660
structurally

1211
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,020
that that license the description of all

1212
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,280
of those as energy

1213
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,200
authors like Alex Kiefer

1214
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,180
have um

1215
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,960
argued Beyond where many go

1216
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,740
to talk about the um

1217
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,500
uh

1218
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,480

thank you everybody

1238
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,619
we will return

1239
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,180
next week

1240
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,520
or in the office hours and just write

1241
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,859
your questions in the

1242
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:55,260
relevant pages and we'll continue the

1243
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,660
discussion so thanks a lot everybody for

1244
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,940
joining

1245
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,480
farewell
