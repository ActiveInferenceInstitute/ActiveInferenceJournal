1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,680
hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,799
it is uh April 5th

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,480
2023

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,760
and we're in our second discussion of

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,940
chapter five in cohort three

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,160
so this is going to be our final

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,359
recorded session for the first half of

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,820
the textbook chapters one through five

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,199
and then

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,539
next week we'll have an unrecorded

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,720
session we will have time to to fill out

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,220
the feedback form for those who haven't

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,359
yet

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,700
we'll discuss project ideas which people

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,640
can also add ideas to we'll just talk a

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,500
little bit more broadly and informally

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,059
about the textbook and about the

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,260
textbook group

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,760
and then we will have a

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,340
inter-semester break or it's not a

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,760
semester but uh uh intermission

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,300
and we'll pick up when cohort 4 begins

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,539
we'll pick up with a second half

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,780
of cohort 3 going through just as

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,120
previous cohorts did

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,939
chapter 6 7 8 9 10 and so on so

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,799
we're in our second discussion of

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,840
chapter five

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,180
I'll head over there now and we'll begin

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,659
just with anybody in the chat or via

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,119
raising their hand or just unmuting

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,240
how does chapter five

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,920
sit with you

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,780
what are any

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,900
thoughts or questions about

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,080
chapter five that you want to just raise

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,039
at the outset

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Jonathan

39
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,860
yeah I sort of feel that um while in

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,240
some sense it says that you don't need

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
to have digested chapter four to

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
understand chapter five it still feels

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,719
like you know there's a lot of

44
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,720
background there which which is really

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,440
important and the the lack of technical

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
Clarity for from chapter four I sort of

47
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,420
feel there's a bit of a hangover

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,738
um from that into chapter five

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,580
the technical debt hangover

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,800
yes

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,220
okay

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,319
thank you Maria

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,940
I was a bit frustrated with this chapter

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,959
because I thought it would be more

55
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,700
insightful but it seemed to me it was

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,140
just more the same bunch of equations

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,660
narrated and plotted

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,860
yes

59
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,879
I guess the um the apologists view would

60
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,239
be chapter four was equations and plots

61
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,220
in general

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,239
and chapter five in contrast is applying

63
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,280
it to the specific mammalian nervous

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,140
system examples

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,080
and to empirical studies

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,840
however broadly I totally agree with

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,959
that

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,239
any any other just

69
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,400
thoughts or primary Reflections on

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,340
chapter five any aspect of it or some

71
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,720
part of the discussion or even any other

72
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,400
active inference learnings over the last

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,620
week or two

74
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,540
that

75
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,360
come to your attention when you're in

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
this setting

77
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,260
foreign

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,819
right in the chat Terry you wrote I was

79
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,560
struck by the similarity to neural

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,480
networks

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,040
you could describe a little more if you

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,720
want to unmute or

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,060
we can see how that might come into play

84
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,000
in the previous chapter 10 discussion

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
from cohort three we were playing with

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,020
the idea of of

87
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,139
reading chapter 10 first

88
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,020
to provide a lot of the conceptual scope

89
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,000
and the historical connections and

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,699
similarities and dissimilarities of

91
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,580
active inference with other topics

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,139
and so like it's interesting to note

93
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,180
neural network

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,479
is is described in the citations and

95
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,720
twice in chapter 10 in this paragraph

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,020
but there's a lot of context

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,860
that is kind of held out

98
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,180
till

99
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,820
chapter 10.

100
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,040
but the intuitions that you're having

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,479
along the way are

102
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,919
um very good

103
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,020
any other just general thought or a

104
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,880
question on five

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,740
otherwise we will look to the questions

106
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,419
and

107
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,120
um address those which we haven't

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,820
addressed previously

109
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,380
and then

110
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,780
continue on through

111
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,380
okay

112
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,780
so continue on this neural network just

113
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,979
while we're

114
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,360
here

115
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,639
let's use the figure

116
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,300
5.5

117
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,620
so here we have 5.5 up

118
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,180
the cortical

119
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,780
system

120
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,400
the

121
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,620
limbic or the midbrain system

122
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,660
associated with policy selection

123
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,100
and

124
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,620
the spinal

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,319
motor execution Arc using this

126
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,600
differential between

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,419
perceptions and set points

128
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,258
and so then

129
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,880
Terry you wrote

130
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,800
the series of nodes passing information

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,220
along a chain with inhibitory mechanisms

132
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,199
alongside

133
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,080
yet neural networks use Transformers

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,479
while active inference uses free energy

135
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,840
well

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,180
great topic

137
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
to go deeper into the relationship

138
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,460
between neural networks

139
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,740
and free energy principle and active

140
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,360
inference models

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,539
in live stream 51

142
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,840
I'm just going to the slides now

143
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,080
the core claim

144
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,199
is that here on the right we see the

145
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,660
Markov blanket and the internal and the

146
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,319
external States

147
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,539
sense coming in perception

148
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,840
action selection resulting in embodied

149
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,160
action

150
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
and uh

151
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,479
an effect upon the generative process

152
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,979
the niche which then provides

153
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,360
observations

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,160
so this is how we've been looking at it

155
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
in

156
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,580
the textbook

157
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,819
on the left side we see in a three-layer

158
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,479
neural network

159
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,000
an input layer

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,979
one or more

161
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,860
compute or intermediate layers which can

162
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,620
have a wide range of connectivities

163
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,900
and then some output layer so this could

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,759
be the image comes in and the classifier

165
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,280
label comes out or the classifier label

166
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,860
comes in and the image generated comes

167
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,880
out

168
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,340
and then it

169
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,680
acts in an environment which then

170
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,259
provides another observation

171
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,860
and in this paper

172
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,500
they demonstrate that the variational

173
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,819
free energy

174
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,539
on this partition

175
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,659
is equivalent to the loss function on

176
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,339
this neural network

177
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,640
so the training of this neural network

178
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,339
is monotonically related to the

179
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,979
variational free energy loss on this

180
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,800
model learning

181
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
the loss function is the function that's

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,060
being minimized to update this neural

183
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,100
network and so it's really quite a

184
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,560
stunning conclusion

185
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,980
because the topologies so how the pieces

186
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,220
are connected of these two models

187
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,899
is entirely different

188
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,060
so in live stream 51 there's more detail

189
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,040
on that

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
um

191
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,040
neural networks use Transformers while

192
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
active inference uses free energy and

193
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,459
Jonathan as Transformers in the

194
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,760
post-2017 technical sense

195
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,399
so in the sort of attention is all you

196
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,899
need

197
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,120
pre-trained Transformer

198
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,160
timeline that we're on

199
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,680
that's a good question and that feels

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,880
specifically like a reinforcement

201
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,040
learning framework or is it more General

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,660
so I I meant there in terms of the the

203
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,580
diagram you were giving where there was

204
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,380
some neural network and a sort of

205
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,420
feedback on an environment

206
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,940
um yeah this this one here which yeah it

207
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,980
looks like a sort of RL

208
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,720
um framework but are you saying this is

209
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,300
sort of more more General than that

210
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,680
foreign

211
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,800
it is more General As I understood the

212
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,880
paper

213
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,700
describing that for the observation

214
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,980
sequence one to T

215
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,200
and the parameterization all the weights

216
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,360
of the neural network

217
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,399
and then analogously the variational

218
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
free energy of those very same

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,380
observations and the parameterization of

220
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,760
the base graph

221
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,220
these two are monotonically related

222
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,420
within a certain

223
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,339
classes

224
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,959
quite broad classes

225
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,540
yes it was I I mean it's

226
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,000
I believe a very major

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,459
recent finding

228
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,500
because it suggests that we can have

229
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,300
this like this on one hand it looks like

230
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,040
a circuit board and it's it's a lot to

231
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,060
look at

232
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,380
however

233
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,899
there is a semantic interpretability

234
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,180
here we see prior

235
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,279
hidden State B that's how things change

236
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,720
Through Time hidden State changing

237
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,980
Through Time hidden state so there's

238
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,600
hidden States changing Through Time

239
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,540
here's the a matrix emitting

240
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,880
observations or you could recognize

241
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,040
observations

242
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,860
decision making preferences guiding

243
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,019
decision making so it's like there is an

244
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,540
interpretability to this base graph

245
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,839
and so the idea that a neural network

246
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,959
which can have an arbitrary topology

247
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,060
with absolutely no semantic

248
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,040
interpretability

249
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,920
kind of like any given neuron

250
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,519
in a real neural system

251
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,300
I mean Jennifer Aniston neuron aside no

252
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,899
neuron plays an explicit semantic role

253
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,079
let alone a one-to-one semantic role

254
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,320
so the idea that this kind of a

255
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,820
aggregate

256
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,560
system

257
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,740
would have a representation where the

258
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,560
variables are semantic

259
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,740
is quite a claim and then the notion

260
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,079
that the training function for both of

261
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,240
them are monotonically related is really

262
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,579
important

263
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,019
not to go too far afield from the

264
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,279
textbook but just neural networks are

265
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,220
bought in and that's an example of some

266
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,880
very recent research that makes that

267
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,079
connection go beyond intuition

268
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,140
okay here's a question that I don't

269
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,240
think that we addressed previously but

270
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,500
if anyone else has any other question

271
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,360
please raise your hand or write in the

272
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,600
chat

273
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,240
so table 5.1

274
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,519
gives a remarkable association between

275
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,200
neurotransmitters and precisions should

276
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,000
we be suspicious that this seems so

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
clean or is this evidence that the

278
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,019
framework is a good match for real brain

279
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,560
functioning

280
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,440
what what does anyone think or

281
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,440
what was their prior suspicion before

282
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,180
seeing the table

283
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,680
and then what was their posterior

284
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,420
suspicion after they saw the table

285
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,360
Jonathan and then anyone else

286
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,700
yeah so this this was my question I I

287
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,860
think I was just surprised that there

288
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,620
was sort of this apparent one-to-one

289
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,940
correspondent or at least near

290
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,399
one-to-one correspondence so I think I

291
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,260
would have expected in a different

292
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,440
neurotransmitters to have you know

293
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,899
a more

294
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,940
um I guess just they're not to be this

295
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,800
this very clean relationship

296
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,819
um that was my prior

297
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,880
foreign

298
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,560
ly these molecules

299
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,339
do

300
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,839
um things

301
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,300
that are not only listed here like

302
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,339
serotonin the word means blood pressure

303
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,040
serotonin was discovered in the blood as

304
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,540
was dopamine

305
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,940
and it has a variety of effects on

306
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,380
immune cells

307
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,019
and then later was understood to play a

308
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,200
role in the central nervous system so

309
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,079
I don't think that these evidence

310
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,579
provided

311
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,740
are suggesting that the exclusive

312
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,060
function

313
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,620
of these neurotransmitter type molecules

314
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,260
is

315
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,660
um that they're exclusively

316
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,639
and exhaustively described by these

317
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,019
evidences

318
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,779
however these do provide empirical

319
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,180
patterns

320
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,399
of everything from histology

321
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,320
to um

322
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,600
association with cognitive functions

323
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,180
neuroimaging studies

324
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,760
um gene expression analysis

325
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,100
pharmacological manipulation like the

326
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,240
whole molecular Neuroscience toolkit

327
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,120
these are quite disparate

328
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,399
phenomena

329
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,680
and their disparate phenomena that on

330
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,699
one hand have been linked

331
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,519
mechanistically to a given molecule

332
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,579
and Associated receptors in all of this

333
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,880
but on the other hand these phenomena

334
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,339
are conceptually linked

335
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,100
to certain to the semantics of certain

336
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,180
parameters in these statistical models

337
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,519
so

338
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,560
maps are not territories it's not saying

339
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,660
that it's exhaustively described

340
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,339
however

341
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,880
if we use this Association as a

342
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,420
heuristic if not a hypothesis

343
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,660
and we find that we have unique

344
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,240
explanatory and predictive powers

345
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,680
then

346
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,839
by the standards of science

347
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,019
it was a valid modeling

348
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,000
approach

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,820
these are explanations

350
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,040
and predictions

351
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,560
that would not be achievable

352
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,779
without mapping

353
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,839
a molecule to the semantics of a

354
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,320
parameter

355
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,320
like just searching acetylcholine on a

356
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,779
literature search engine

357
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,360
you'll find a whole variety of different

358
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,339
studies different study types different

359
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,699
outcomes different species and so on

360
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:46,519
so that's the um scruffy

361
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,240
the scruffy is what the search engine

362
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,620
just gives you

363
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,720
each paper is unique every experiment is

364
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,279
unique

365
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,040
and then the the the neater the neat

366
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,100
would be like all neurotransmitters do

367
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,500
one thing

368
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,740
and so somewhere that is

369
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,559
useful enough to help us make

370
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,199
explanations and predictions

371
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,980
but not so terminally differentiated

372
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,919
that we can't link together novel

373
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,959
strands of evidence into explanations

374
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,459
and predictions

375
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,740
somewhere

376
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,419
bridging or respecting the neat and

377
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,919
Scruffy

378
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,439
articulation is active inference

379
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,720
and the ways that we can use statistical

380
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,760
models

381
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,340
to connect to these broad empirical

382
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,840
results

383
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,179
on different chemicals

384
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,039
so

385
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,539
should we be suspicious that it's so

386
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,580
clean well yes they're presenting their

387
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,380
arguments

388
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,020
like a prosecutor

389
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,240
they're not necessarily going into every

390
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,160
caveat or bringing up studies that might

391
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
um disconfirm that

392
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,900
so for sure it's connecting dots and not

393
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,460
all the dots are being shown and not all

394
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,419
the connections are being shown

395
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,740
but it moves the discussion forward

396
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,919
about how aspects of maps

397
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,440
which are to say cognitive models

398
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
are related to aspects of territory

399
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,460
which include the actual

400
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,140
materiality of the neural system

401
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Michael and then anyone else

402
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,740
hello Daniel

403
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,299
um sorry I've been

404
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,179
um out of pocket for a week or so but um

405
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,760
I'm trying to catch up in the way I'm

406
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,280
trying to make sense of what I'm uh now

407
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,039
Landing into I wanted to kind of

408
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,539
validate does this make sense or not

409
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,559
make sense

410
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,740
um if if one were to think and the way

411
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,900
I've been trying to the mental models

412
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,980
that have been trying to map this

413
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,140
conversation into are about social

414
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,020
conversations and when you could say one

415
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,720
level of activity up from if you will

416
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,660
the biological biochemistry and I was

417
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,280
thinking if these were

418
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,660
uh verbs you know sorry if each of these

419
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,720
um neurotransmitters were nouns verbs

420
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,179
adjectives and that sentences were being

421
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,980
created you know they could be created

422
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,320
many different ways but but that there

423
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,700
are units of

424
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,000
of composition if you will of of message

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,299
signaling that are are creating

426
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,260
um

427
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,039
larger sentences in in in at that level

428
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,520
of the system would that metaphor make

429
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,039
sense or would it be missing

430
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,799
um how might it be a mismatch for what

431
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,620
has happened

432
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,880
great question

433
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
does anyone have a thought on that

434
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,160
potentially referencing figure 5.5 or

435
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,260
any other area

436
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,000
but any thought on this question

437
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
oh I'll give a first thought then please

438
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,620
anyone can build on it so

439
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,460
um

440
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,799
what is speech really it's this

441
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,860
continuous flow of like phonemes and and

442
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,760
so it is not subject object verb

443
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,340
in how it actually is like the

444
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,500
materiality of speech is vibration in

445
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,760
the air and all of that in the

446
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,900
embodiment and so that's like the

447
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,120
territory of speech but let's just say

448
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,280
that we're putting on our linguist hat

449
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,500
so now we're going to think about

450
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,840
certain parts of speech as like subject

451
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,960
object verb or noun an adverb and so on

452
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,780
even though the speaker may have not

453
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,760
thought about it that way

454
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,900
so

455
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,539
we're making maps of sentences as

456
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,919
linguists

457
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,340
even if the speaker didn't use that map

458
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,940
when they generated the speech

459
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,520
let's think about what sentence

460
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,340
does this whole figure represent

461
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,940
um

462
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,780
and uh beliefs about this and beliefs

463
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,220
about that

464
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,580
lead to some differential contrasts

465
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,820
in light of incoming evidence

466
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,039
and the result of that

467
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,020
is

468
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,600
now we're going to leave that little

469
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,160
clause

470
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,320
and the result of that contrast in light

471
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,320
of incoming evidence is

472
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,140
a decision-making process about what to

473
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,039
do

474
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,799
given Precision on the decision-making

475
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,340
process

476
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,380
and one of the outcomes

477
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,740
of that decision-making process

478
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,720
is

479
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,900
a descending prediction

480
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,960
that contrasts with incoming sensory

481
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
data and results in an action

482
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,460
hopefully it's not too mixed of a

483
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,600
metaphor

484
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,240
but absolutely

485
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,659
these different compositions

486
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,460
just like infinite grammar you can keep

487
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,980
on adding yes and also in the social

488
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,059
space

489
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,539
you can keep on adding sentences to each

490
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,820
other and make longer paragraphs you can

491
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,000
keep on making longer sentences or lists

492
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
similarly you can keep on making larger

493
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,980
generative models

494
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,720
or different generative models

495
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,100
and so

496
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,559
different connections amongst these

497
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,299
units

498
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,100
are going to be described kind of like

499
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,659
by the genre

500
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,880
like that was a haiku

501
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,700
that was a sentence with no noun

502
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,559
that was a question that was a directive

503
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,080
so loosely

504
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,880
it's a great

505
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,460
working model

506
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,140
to think about this as a graphically

507
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,419
arranged sentence

508
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,780
that's expressing something

509
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,480
where some of the nodes

510
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,340
some of the tokens

511
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,880
are associated with more belief like

512
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,740
States

513
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,600
some of the nodes are associated with

514
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
observations

515
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,620
some of the nodes are associated with

516
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,340
capacities for action and so on

517
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,960
and so we can kind of like play with

518
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,299
Legos play with language

519
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,520
and compose like well what if there were

520
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,580
these three sensory modalities and two

521
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,620
action possibilities and decision making

522
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,140
was done this way

523
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,159
that's a generative model

524
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,919
cool yeah and and then

525
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,020
and then however that sentence is

526
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,760
diagrammed

527
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,000
it simply wouldn't be the actual speech

528
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,559
itself

529
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,559
it wouldn't be the vibration of the the

530
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,440
voice box or the air

531
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
so that's like map territory

532
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,780
but once we're in the map

533
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,240
then sentences might have this kind of

534
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,860
structure

535
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,020
or this could be the dependency

536
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,640
structure

537
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,980
of an organization

538
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,380
or the dependency structure of claims

539
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,820
in a scientific Corpus

540
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,880
that's kind of what Bayes graphs do

541
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,520
they describe different variables and

542
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,299
their associations

543
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,100
and that also speaks to their

544
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,780
flexibility

545
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,299
like you could know all of these and

546
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,159
solve for that one

547
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,200
or you could just have these ones and

548
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,580
try to reduce your uncertainty about

549
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,020
those

550
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,900
that'd be like a sentence where

551
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,860
um

552
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,539
you did hear the first part but not the

553
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,799
second part or vice versa

554
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,760
thank you Dan again every time I join

555
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,860
these conversations my mind gets mental

556
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,500
models get blown open and thank you

557
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,659
again

558
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,520
good well hopefully they're not

559
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,620
um

560
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,419
reduced to Rubble because your your

561
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,520
intuition was was

562
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,900
um right

563
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,080
about taking a linguistic approach I

564
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,760
mean who's to say it's right

565
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,620
it certainly is compatible

566
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,020
and um these this is like a composition

567
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,340
um this is a setting where we can

568
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,559
compose generative models

569
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,299
and so that's why sometimes it's like a

570
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,440
little challenge like what's the active

571
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,419
inference um answer on attention what's

572
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,600
the answer on memory it's like those are

573
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,880
complex cognitive phenomena that play

574
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,159
out differently in different systems

575
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,000
so if the framework were

576
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,320
rigid enough to give an answer to that

577
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,200
in general it wouldn't have the latitude

578
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
that we need

579
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,700
to actually describe that phenomena

580
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,279
and so we want to have the latitude to

581
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
describe different phenomena including

582
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,120
unnamed phenomena

583
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,940
in systems we haven't seen yet

584
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,860
which means that the framework itself

585
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,919
can't be so specific about how certain

586
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,640
things play out

587
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,179
it's mind-blowing it's absolutely

588
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:40,799
mind-blowing

589
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,480
um

590
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,159
and it's such a problem I know I said

591
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,100
every time it's such a privilege to be

592
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,460
in this conversation and witnessing you

593
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,000
make sense of it through this complex

594
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,760
Collective lens when I've been thinking

595
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,640
in blocks and um and these blocks are

596
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,860
being you know it's like no these aren't

597
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,340
bricks they're flows and and it works

598
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,320
cause and effect works differently and

599
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,500
it's just as I say mind-blowing and uh

600
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,179
and daunting but thank you

601
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,120
thank you it's definitely a team efforts

602
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,039
and we've been through it many times in

603
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,980
many people's insights have been folded

604
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,640
together

605
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,960
um

606
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
does anyone else in chat or raising

607
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,340
their hand want to

608
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,679
have any reflection on five or a

609
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,080
question or we can

610
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,400
um

611
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,100
look over some sections and then in the

612
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,020
in the last minutes we can like look

613
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,320
ahead to the second part of the book

614
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,418
or or whatever people prefer

615
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,779
is there a nerve a neural system

616
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,539
or some embodied

617
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,760
behaviors that people want to

618
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,440
investigate

619
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,419
I'll add in this

620
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,960
question

621
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,380
okay thank you Jana are there better or

622
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,940
sorry are there alternative

623
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,039
visualizations that better show the

624
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,659
interdependencies

625
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,039
that's really

626
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,059
interesting question

627
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,459
um

628
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,039
in a base graph

629
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,000
the edges reflect

630
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,740
um

631
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,980
yeah and I'll add this in thank you in

632
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,679
the base graph the edges reflect

633
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,980
a certain kind of statistical connection

634
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,539
amongst variables

635
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,799
but

636
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,799
this entire structure

637
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,070
it's kind of like

638
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,419
[Music]

639
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,799
um

640
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,840
a web

641
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,900
or like a tensegrity sculpture

642
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,620
or like a guitar string

643
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,940
um in that

644
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,159
the really an edge like let's just say

645
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,279
it from this S3 to Pi 3.

646
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,320
but yes but then if policy selection

647
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,419
ends up doing something in the real

648
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,720
world then that is going to influence

649
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,020
future proprioceptive inputs

650
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,159
so

651
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,799
even edges that aren't shown

652
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,320
it's not that they're not associated

653
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,760
with each other

654
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,000
through the reality of the system

655
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
but the edges are showing the kind of

656
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,120
direct connections again not the

657
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,059
anatomical direct connections

658
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,799
then it would just be an anatomy

659
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,940
textbook

660
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,520
but it's showing the direct

661
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,399
informational or causal connections

662
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,918
um

663
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,960
so how can we visualize the

664
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,799
interdependencies

665
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,360
there's so many

666
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,159
ways you might explore but I really like

667
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
that as something for us to think more

668
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,419
about like one more traditional way

669
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,539
in terms of scientific visualization

670
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,419
would be we could plot

671
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,740
um S3 as a on the x-axis and

672
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,419
um you know mu sub x one on the y-axis

673
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,159
and then we could ask whether there was

674
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,500
any correlation or Mutual information

675
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,899
between those two variables

676
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,760
so the fact that they're not connected

677
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,500
it doesn't mean it's going to be just a

678
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,340
blur

679
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,080
in fact they might be very strongly

680
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,240
associated with each other

681
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,940
but through

682
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,320
um some intermediate notes

683
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,539
so that would be one way of looking at

684
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,299
whether to Any Given nodes two or three

685
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,880
or however many whether they have

686
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,840
associations and or interdependencies

687
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,940
um and then I guess another like little

688
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,340
layer is like the space of the counter

689
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,240
factual

690
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,460
like some interdependencies might not be

691
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,919
revealed unless something changes in the

692
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,100
system

693
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,980
so that is also a layer where

694
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,940
um

695
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,500
two things might have no correlation and

696
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,779
then you remove

697
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:25,679
um

698
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,419
you remove an edge and then all of a

699
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,679
sudden two things that weren't in

700
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,480
association

701
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,320
um now are

702
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,840
um okay I I I don't think that's a

703
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,419
complete answer because there's a lot of

704
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,120
work with visualization to be done but

705
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,240
that is just kind of some aspect of it

706
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,919
um

707
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,360
but then just continuing with the honest

708
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,100
question that then to Jonathan so so it

709
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,840
is like a magnetic coil

710
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,399
the electric field is not going along

711
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,658
the coil it is a field

712
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:13,279
a lot to think about don't

713
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,480
have a specific thought if anybody wants

714
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,559
to add something but yes I

715
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,980
like what if these are wires and then

716
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,779
there's like fields of influence that

717
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,880
aren't just the wires but the

718
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,740
connections are are there and they're

719
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,200
relevant but then there might be

720
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
other dependencies that aren't simply

721
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,699
mapped out on The Wire dependencies

722
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,219
um

723
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,799
okay Jonathan I'm going to copy your

724
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,860
question in

725
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,480
has this been looked at in hypograph

726
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,340
language rather than graphs

727
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,039
um

728
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,279
in active block fronts

729
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,760
we we looked briefly at hypergraphs

730
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,039
we haven't seen any active hypographs

731
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,000
but

732
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,220
it's very interesting

733
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,419
a graph Through Time

734
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,779
so for example what if um this right now

735
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,480
there's a static topology

736
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,220
so even if there's Dynamic information

737
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,140
flowing through this graph you could say

738
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,299
that it's a static graph

739
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,220
the referent is dynamic it's changing

740
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,140
through time but the structure is not

741
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,360
changing Through Time

742
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,200
but what if um on even and odd time

743
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,059
steps

744
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,940
um this connection existed or not

745
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,700
then that kind of a of a system

746
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,419
as far as I understand is um

747
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,179
a hypergraph

748
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,159
is there some other aspect to hypergraph

749
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,379
Jonathan or what would enabling this

750
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,560
inactive inference help us do

751
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,139
so hypographs sort of allow for more

752
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,599
General types of edges

753
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,859
um it it sort of allows for edges which

754
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,260
specifically go through vertices kind of

755
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,440
the the easiest um example is a is a

756
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,159
plain routing system airplanes where if

757
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,339
a single airplane goes from

758
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,520
um airport A to B to C

759
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,500
um it's very clear that it's the same

760
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,199
airplane that's gone between those and

761
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,359
just by drawing an edge between A and B

762
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,859
and B and C that doesn't give the same

763
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:50,339
information that sort of a single piece

764
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,899
of information or a singular single

765
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,879
airplane has taken a particular route so

766
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,500
it just allows for for more

767
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,480
generalizations of

768
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,760
um of edges than in in a regular graph

769
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,200
I just wonder essentially about the the

770
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
way you can encode the types of

771
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,280
information that move through a

772
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,160
um through a regular graph and a

773
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,980
hypograph and one might be able to

774
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,500
encode more specific information in a in

775
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,859
a hypograph

776
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,579
yeah very interesting I'm pretty sure

777
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,560
that it hasn't been

778
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,000
written on in active a lot of the papers

779
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,560
seem very recent like the one you point

780
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,339
to is um 2018

781
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,260
and the others are recent so it's um

782
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,460
it'd be an interesting area

783
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,339
um one note on this to kind of um

784
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,980
speak to the other side where the kind

785
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,660
of map

786
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,960
uh is very effective with respect to the

787
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,180
territory for better and For Worse

788
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,000
what if these were computers and these

789
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,180
were the literal wires connecting them

790
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,040
in that case

791
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,980
you could design in silico

792
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,619
or cyber physical systems

793
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,520
where the edges of the base graph

794
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,619
very well mapped to the causal structure

795
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,160
of the system

796
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,578
physically

797
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,760
so

798
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,880
the the kind of

799
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
one of the hardest systems

800
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,079
and one of the richest systems is like

801
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,180
trying to make simple statistical models

802
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,579
of the brain but when making just in

803
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,260
silico systems

804
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,380
so just simple pedagogical models or

805
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,119
intuition pumps

806
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,480
or in certain systems for for um digital

807
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,940
and Communications systems

808
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,579
the edges can have a much more

809
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:00,540
um

810
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,800
clear interpretation

811
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,780
because as laid out in the beginning of

812
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,020
five

813
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,520
this is kind of

814
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,060
this is the tension and the dream

815
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,040
would be what what if the actual

816
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,720
anatomical

817
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,480
connections

818
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,079
amongst these cell types

819
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,440
what if those were actually reflective

820
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,980
of the structure of a base graph

821
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,839
and and you'll note that they're not

822
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,300
exactly exactly the same

823
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,400
like just here's you know two to three

824
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,500
and here we see that's two to three but

825
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,200
also it goes from here from

826
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,200
from um four to two but we don't see a

827
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,560
four to two in the tissue

828
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,680
so but but it's close enough but clearly

829
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,160
not close enough to Merit calling this

830
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,980
simply layer 5.

831
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,359
and then I guess to the electric field

832
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,180
these connections are the neural

833
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,380
connections

834
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,020
what if there are glial connections what

835
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,800
if there are electric fields

836
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,960
um influences

837
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,619
like what the EEG measures

838
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:20,400
um

839
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,700
are some of the electrical phenomena

840
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,020
of

841
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,180
these cells

842
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,099
and actually just a specific kind of

843
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,320
electrical phenomena of these cells the

844
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,619
EEG outside of the head

845
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,500
but those electrical signals are not

846
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,320
only

847
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,300
um outputs

848
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,579
like Epi phenomenal to neural activity

849
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,859
they're also inducing different changes

850
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,960
in neural activity as well

851
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,180
so that there's also physical edges that

852
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,740
aren't shown just you know complex

853
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,599
systems are complex

854
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,800
and they engage in in multiple

855
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,820
mechanistic ways

856
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,800
which is why it's important to have maps

857
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,640
of them Ali

858
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,520
uh yeah uh well actually going back to

859
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,640
Yana's question and also to uh touch on

860
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,940
what Jonathan just uh mentioned uh well

861
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,940
uh in fact when we're talking about uh

862
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,880
interaction uh obviously there are many

863
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,000
different conceptions of this term

864
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,700
interaction so we can talk about

865
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,520
physical interaction which is basically

866
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,640
uh I mean for the most part

867
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,619
um is undertaken uh the fields so we can

868
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,900
also term it as a kind of field

869
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,020
interaction but there are some other

870
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,180
conceptions of interaction

871
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,920
actually there are many others but

872
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,300
probably one of uh the most important

873
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,400
conceptions for our purposes is

874
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,119
information theoretic interaction uh so

875
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,400
uh when we're talking uh talking about

876
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,140
message passing or uh this conception of

877
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,839
interaction through and I mean

878
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,280
information passing or information

879
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,800
theoretic conception of it we're not

880
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,400
necessarily

881
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,760
deciding on what's it what exactly is

882
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,400
the medium of interaction or

883
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,500
transmission because it can be uh

884
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,119
abstracted away this medium of

885
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,220
transmission or interaction and we can

886
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,380
just look at the

887
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,160
um I mean mathematical framework of

888
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,619
um or the mathematical structure of

889
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,680
those information so for instance

890
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,220
um say uh IIT framework integrated

891
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,079
information framework in which uh well

892
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,680
in information

893
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,980
integrated information Theory

894
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,220
it's unable to distinguish a highly

895
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,060
interdependent set of components

896
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,880
dominated by a redundant relations from

897
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,160
an equally

898
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,619
strongly interacting set of combo

899
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:13,380
components exhibiting a kind of strong

900
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,920
Synergy between them so this is actually

901
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,400
kind of a limitation for IIT for some

902
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,320
people because

903
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,480
since redundancy indicates that

904
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,160
although a strong interaction is needed

905
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,760
to ensure that a component is a kind of

906
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,680
repetition of the other components it

907
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,960
does not imply that the set of

908
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,619
components support Collective emergent

909
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,839
Behavior which is entirely different

910
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,079
from that of the individual components

911
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,020
so in recent years by recent I mean

912
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,380
since 2020 there are some interesting

913
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,240
Works in that regard trying to formulate

914
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,119
uh the the interdependencies and

915
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,099
emergence with mathematical formalism so

916
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:07,320
Lionel Barnett if I remember his name

917
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,780
correctly and also Anil Seth and others

918
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,940
for custom of their names has done some

919
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,640
pretty interesting work in that regard

920
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,400
in recent years and one of the uh

921
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,640
interesting things they've came across

922
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,500
is that they've tried to apply this uh

923
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,320
abstract conception of interaction and

924
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,640
interdependencies from information

925
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,760
theoretical theoretic point of view to

926
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,160
neuroimaging datas and uh so they

927
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,480
and they've been able to

928
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,339
describe this interaction of neural

929
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,619
interaction between different brain

930
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:52,640
regions without accounting

931
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,040
explicitly accounting for synaptic or I

932
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,819
don't know a junction uh interaction or

933
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:03,119
so on so it's much more abstract and

934
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,060
much more generalized form of uh

935
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,599
interaction

936
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,460
awesome

937
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,720
yes

938
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,079
anatomy and physiology are different

939
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,579
Anatomy is describing

940
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:24,960
the articulations of the system

941
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,780
but then the physiological relationships

942
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,020
and correlations and even causes

943
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,420
are not necessarily

944
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,040
following along the anatomical lines

945
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,780
and

946
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,280
um

947
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,400
if one wants the anatomical answer

948
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,440
you can just slice the tissue and take

949
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,640
the picture

950
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,099
so something different is happening with

951
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,780
this modeling

952
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,359
and it's important like you mentioned

953
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,579
that this interaction concept amongst

954
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,740
variables

955
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,339
by the time we're labeling variables

956
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,260
we're in the map

957
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,619
we're not labeling the tissue anymore

958
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,020
so the only possible kind of interaction

959
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,420
that these variables can have is like

960
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,460
statistical or information theoretic

961
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,259
but then there's this tantalizing

962
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,020
dream

963
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:29,099
slash fallacy slash actionable framework

964
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,020
all of those

965
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,680
that parameters do map onto aspects of

966
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,540
the territory and that's the map

967
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,920
territory

968
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,420
dialectic

969
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,020
some maps useful in some contexts

970
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,200
doesn't reify the the architecture of

971
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,520
the map

972
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,500
and it doesn't prove or disprove any

973
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,700
architecture of the system

974
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,119
and the interesting thing is that's not

975
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,180
even active inference specific

976
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,000
these are active inference type thank

977
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,800
you Ali

978
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,099
these are active inference or predictive

979
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,780
processing like models

980
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,319
however

981
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:17,400
any statistical or cognitive modeling

982
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,380
approach is going to confront this issue

983
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,339
and then how do we move Beyond just

984
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,440
simply saying well map territory means

985
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,540
we we can't drive or we can't do route

986
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,920
planning

987
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,800
it's like well if dopamine is associated

988
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
with Precision in this model

989
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,540
where should the deep brain stimulator

990
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,960
go or what kind of food would make sense

991
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,880
to eat or not eat

992
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,640
or and so on so we can actually reduce

993
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,859
uncertainty about what actions to take

994
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,480
using Maps

995
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,119
and that's what these are

996
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,859
and those Maps

997
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,780
arguably

998
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,359
works best when

999
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,040
it's understood what's a map and what's

1000
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,319
the territory

1001
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,359
and understanding what the map is can be

1002
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,339
fully described

1003
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:10,619
and held to the standards of of

1004
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,960
reproducibility

1005
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,020
whereas holding a territory to those

1006
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,220
same epistemic Norms or criteria

1007
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,040
it it doesn't even make sense

1008
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,020
the territory can't be fully described

1009
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,079
but when they're overlaid

1010
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,200
even symbolically

1011
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,540
it can become

1012
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,319
ambiguous

1013
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,220
well

1014
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,920
next week we're going to

1015
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,720
um

1016
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,700
not record

1017
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,200
so if you're going to be there again

1018
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,700
that's awesome

1019
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,579
otherwise please fill out the feedback

1020
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,200
form in the future textbook group

1021
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,440
section and check out the project ideas

1022
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,000
but in these last 10 minutes today

1023
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,760
is there any sections or questions on

1024
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,980
chapter five

1025
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,000
that anybody wants to look at or

1026
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,380
would

1027
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,260
people like to see into chapter six

1028
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,980
um I've just added those additional

1029
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,040
comments I was making into

1030
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,079
your coda

1031
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,800
and I'm making a quick visualization

1032
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,079
of what I was thinking about I'm not

1033
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,300
sure if this relates directly to the

1034
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,220
model

1035
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,780
um but just I'll need a minute to

1036
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,560
get this done thank you all I'll leave

1037
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,119
the tab up we'll return to it

1038
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,859
any preference for a section of five or

1039
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,319
to to look ahead to chapter six in the

1040
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,160
recipe

1041
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,380
even though we'll return to that in like

1042
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,680
a month

1043
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,599
well

1044
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,020
looking at yes go ahead Michael

1045
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,819
I was going to say no objection here I

1046
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:42,240
just wanted somebody to respond okay

1047
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,940
let's revisit the whole first half of

1048
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,400
the book which you all have now

1049
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,920
completed one or more passes through

1050
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,160
chapter one provided an overview

1051
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,560
chapters 2 and 3 describe the low road

1052
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,599
and the high road the low road how are

1053
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,099
we going to do it with Bayesian

1054
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,220
statistics uncontentious

1055
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,660
why

1056
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,119
at the very least we need repeated

1057
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,980
measurement if something can't be

1058
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,380
repeatedly measured by us

1059
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,359
it's not a thing to us

1060
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:14,400
and then a little bit more from the

1061
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,980
inside if something can't take adaptive

1062
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,619
action or more adaptive action to

1063
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,500
persist and repeatedly measure itself

1064
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,200
it won't be that kind of thing either so

1065
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,520
whether you view

1066
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,460
from the outside repeated measurement or

1067
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,940
you view from the inside adaptive action

1068
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,400
we can model both of those in terms of

1069
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,619
this self-evidising

1070
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,480
primary imperative

1071
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,619
how are we going to model that

1072
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,619
self-evidising primary imperative

1073
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:45,480
Bayesian statistics

1074
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,220
chapter four

1075
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,319
with all of its

1076
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,119
shakes and bumps

1077
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,579
was describing the generative models of

1078
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,579
active inference and how variational

1079
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,260
Bayesian inference is used

1080
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,380
as a heuristic or an approximation

1081
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,680
to otherwise intractable Bayesian

1082
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,200
statistical models and we just looked at

1083
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,880
chapter five

1084
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,619
which characterized a few subsystems of

1085
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,619
the mammalian neuroanatomy

1086
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,560
and then linked them together and

1087
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,020
provided some references to other models

1088
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,000
that go into a lot more detail

1089
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,119
computationally and and molecularly

1090
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,180
here's what is going to be coming up in

1091
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,460
the second half of the book

1092
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,760
that is the application oriented part of

1093
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,800
the book now it may not go all the way

1094
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,440
to the guidebook Playbook handbook that

1095
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,680
we all expect and prefer but it is more

1096
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,079
pragmatically an application oriented

1097
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,400
than the first half of the book

1098
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,040
in chapter 6 there's a recipe for

1099
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,619
Designing active inference models with

1100
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,780
some here we've even gone through that

1101
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,780
recipe but broadly they're going to lay

1102
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,280
out some steps

1103
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,800
about systems of interest about

1104
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,660
specification of the generative model

1105
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,240
and the generative process and there's a

1106
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,700
lot of good discussions around even

1107
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,800
broader considerations like why are we

1108
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,420
making this model who are we making the

1109
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,579
model for is this model being used

1110
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,980
descriptively

1111
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,500
like historically or is it being used

1112
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,140
proactively

1113
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,140
that's the recipe so you want to open up

1114
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,460
a restaurant

1115
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,960
here's the active inference recipe

1116
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:37,140
chapter 7 and chapter 8

1117
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,420
are like a pair

1118
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,579
chapter 7 is going to cover

1119
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:43,680
generative models that have discrete

1120
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,619
time characteristics chapter 8 is going

1121
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,960
to look at octave inference in

1122
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,800
continuous time

1123
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,380
discrete time active inference on the

1124
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,180
top of figure 4.3

1125
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,859
continuous time active inference

1126
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:06,780
generative model on the bottom of figure

1127
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,160
4.3

1128
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,160
so chapters 7 and 8 are going to

1129
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,480
basically zoom in on figure 4.3 in

1130
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,460
sequence

1131
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,640
chapter 9 model based data analysis is

1132
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,319
going to describe some of the framings

1133
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,500
and challenges and opportunities

1134
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,400
associated with

1135
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,980
integrating empirical data

1136
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,559
with these kinds of generative models

1137
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,980
so far up till then it's kind of been

1138
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,839
like here's the generative model we

1139
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:38,819
constructed and now we're going to

1140
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,740
simulate Its Behavior

1141
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,520
so generative model specification

1142
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,319
simulation in silico generation of

1143
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,700
synthetic data

1144
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,740
but we're not always just interested in

1145
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,319
generating synthetic data sometimes we

1146
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,020
want to take in empirical data from

1147
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,940
measurements and that's what this

1148
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,200
chapter is about

1149
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,359
and then chapter 10 is a longer chapter

1150
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:05,579
there's no equations or figures

1151
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,359
and it is a Capstone that's describing a

1152
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,980
lot of the conceptual and historical

1153
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,099
context and as kind of referenced

1154
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,780
earlier

1155
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,300
um may make sense to even read first

1156
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,980
that is where we're going in the second

1157
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,339
half of the cohort so the first half as

1158
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,819
the authors lay out is epistemic we're

1159
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:33,420
getting like the roads into the city

1160
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,880
what the city is about or one restaurant

1161
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,200
in the city

1162
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,119
and then a few dishes that have been

1163
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,700
prepared in this city

1164
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,880
then we're going to go behind the scenes

1165
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,339
look at the recipe for Designing those

1166
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,319
models

1167
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:52,920
talk about two subtypes of Cuisine the

1168
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,920
discrete time and the continuous time

1169
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,839
talk about connecting these generative

1170
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,880
models to measurements

1171
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,280
so that people can do analyzes and write

1172
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,559
papers and all of that make things that

1173
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,059
do things in the world

1174
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:09,180
and then having done all of that chapter

1175
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,680
10

1176
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,299
connects a lot of dots

1177
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,520
that's the par at all textbook and for

1178
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,800
being here you all are at least half

1179
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,859
done with it

1180
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,079
and um

1181
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,900
as also mentioned we we go at a similar

1182
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,180
pace

1183
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,040
we haven't set the dates yet for the

1184
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,680
second half of cohort three

1185
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,680
it'll likely pick up again in May when

1186
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,040
we have cohort 4 begin with chapter one

1187
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,140
and um if you have any feedback or ideas

1188
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,500
it would be extremely appreciated

1189
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,900
to fill out this feedback form just

1190
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,520
directly in Coda you can just submit it

1191
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,960
right there

1192
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,420
as well as to share the link for others

1193
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,640
to join and convey to them just say hey

1194
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,119
stick around you will learn it's not XYZ

1195
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,920
or it is XYZ

1196
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,260
but feel free to share that so that we

1197
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,140

cohorts such as this one and also any

1199
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,280
other comments you want to write there

1200
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,000

1201
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,760
and next week

1202
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,680
um we're gonna Focus all about that

1203
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,940
we're gonna

1204
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,920
not record that session

1205
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,240
we're going to talk about the project

1206
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,800
ideas table

1207
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,500
overall Reflections on the first half

1208
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,440
next steps in about the future of the

1209
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,480
textbook group

1210
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,730
um

1211
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:38,940
[Music]

1212
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,800
Jana I'll look forward to your image and

1213
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,900
in the last minute or two anyone else

1214
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,880
please feel free to add other comments

1215
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:57,599
it's not exactly goodbye as we will meet

1216
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,599
again but this is the last recording

1217
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,240
for this half of the cohort

1218
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,760
I'll uh put the image in Coda

1219
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,339
um in a few minutes so I'll I'll let you

1220
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:26,579
know Discord uh when it's ready thank

1221
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,440
you and it just makes me think about

1222
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,800
like these base graphs are kind of like

1223
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,780
the statistic this is the necessary and

1224
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,940
sufficient information for a statistical

1225
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,319
model

1226
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:38,700
but

1227
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,940
we might tell stories or link

1228
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,400
associations that don't follow this

1229
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,500
exact topology

1230
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,720
so this is not like the only web we can

1231
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,059
draw but it's a really important one

1232
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,839
for certain kinds of statistical models

1233
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:56,280
all right

1234
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,880
so next week same time

1235
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,859
for

1236
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:02,819
um

1237
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,200
feedback

1238
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,300
and next steps

1239
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,099
thank you everybody see you then
