1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,479
all right greetings thanks for joining

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,620
everyone

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,240
it's

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,000
March 8 2023

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,059
meeting seven for cohort three

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,240
were in our second discussion on chapter

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,800
three

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
in the textbook

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,820
and

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,180
last time we went over

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,920
the whole chapter

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,439
kind of ran through it but many things

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,159
that we can return to and many questions

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,640
that people have on chapter three

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,760
so to begin with does anyone whether

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,440
they wrote the question previously or

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,700
not

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,680
do they want to just like share

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,520
something from their reading

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
about three

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,539
or some

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,180
Insight or question about three or

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,620
whatever else you want to share right

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,739
now

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,740
Jonathan and then anyone else

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,600
yeah I think I'm particularly interested

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,420
in the the question there about um about

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,000
the graphic with the distributions

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,600
um

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,420
I don't know if uh Francois around at

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,920
the moment but I was uh talking with him

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,140
about this this question there are some

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,520
some things we're a bit confused about

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,900
so that would be very interesting for me

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,040
to go through

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,080
this one the pink one

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,939
yeah all right thank you

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,939
any other just general comments

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,939
otherwise we can just start with this

40
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,839
3.2

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,060
all right

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,119
all right so figure 3.2

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
so for the top graphs these are Point

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,879
sampled from distributions mu or x given

45
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,680
B for different values of B blanket

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,780
states on the x-axis this is fine

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,540
for the bottom left graph

48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,060
what is meant by the average internal

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,360
state

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,700
the average value of mu for all the

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,180
points in the top right graph

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,500
which are just sampled from conditional

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,019
distributions so to get exact value we

54
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,700
would have to take infinite samples or

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,179
integrate

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,459
my question is how exactly do we

57
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,280
from the bottom left plot

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,819
identify the average X and variance

59
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,340
around it

60
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,560
and then for the bottom right plot what

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,780
exactly is the expected value that X is

62
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,040
conditioned upon

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
the subscript is p of mu given B do we

64
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
select a specific b or double integrate

65
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,340
over B as well

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,840
all right

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
great question does anyone want to give

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,580
a first thought on

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,819
how

70
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,379
anyone can just describe the the graph

71
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,819
as they see it

72
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,260
or

73
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,239
give a thought on how from the bottom

74
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,459
left graph the bottom right is generated

75
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,220
Jonathan

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,760
yes maybe I can talk through what what I

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,319
think and what what the confusion for me

78
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,400
was

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
um and so if we go to the the top graphs

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,760
there

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,560
um we're we're clearly looking there so

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,480
X here is sort of for instance some

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,819
external temperature and B is the the

84
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,159
sensory State and so it says

85
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,720
um how is the

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,180
um external temperature conditioned on

87
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,319
the the centuries date even though

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,000
there's not a causal relationship in

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,860
that direction and then how is the

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,540
internal State

91
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,720
um uh determined by the the sensory by

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
by the centuries Day by the blanket

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,900
state

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,879
um and so I think the these two make

95
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,560
make sense

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,900
um and then indeed the the bottom left I

97
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,279
think also

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,079
um makes some sense

99
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,880
um in that you can take some particular

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,199
b

101
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,120
um and you can say what are the what's

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,199
the distribution in both mu and X over B

103
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,479
and that will give you this this graph

104
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,940
or any particular value of B I think for

105
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,220
me the confusion here lies in so the

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,139
bottom right plot there is written as

107
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,120
the expectation

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
um where your where the the distribution

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,380
is over

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,680
um it's mu given b

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
um and so it's not quite clear there

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,620
what

113
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,660
um mu given B would normally I would

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,460
normally think of that as you give it a

115
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,979
particular value of B and from that and

116
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,600
it's an expectation it's a distribution

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
over the Muse

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
um and the expectation thereby over the

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Muse but it's not clear here that this

120
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,020
is actually for a given B so the

121
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,300
question I think is is that expectation

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,479
at the bottom right really over mu given

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,120
b or is it just over mu

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
yeah great question I'll try to give a

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
first thought but if anyone sees any

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,620
other mathematical way go for it I

127
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,500
believe it is for a specific B

128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,160
so we're looking at this crosshairs

129
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,380
where uh so we'll just continue with

130
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,940
this temperature but we're dealing with

131
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,160
a with an agent who who's mapping is

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,080
might be like a little bit wacky with

133
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,580
temperature

134
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,300
um

135
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
so

136
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,620
when mu is 50

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,660
that is corresponding to a blanket

138
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,940
reading of negative

139
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,199
five

140
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,740
so if if all we got was a b

141
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,560
um reading of negative five

142
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,500
our maximum likelihood estimate for Mu

143
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,960
would be 50.

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,100
now

145
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,560
so that's not what we're conditioning on

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,139
a particular observation of B

147
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,820
now conditioning on mu being 50

148
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,160
we have a mean and a variance of just

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,699
this

150
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,800
thank you um Amy I am recording just on

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,380
OBS not zoom so it didn't make the

152
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,240
announcement but indeed it will be

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,340
uploaded here

154
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,580
um so condition on mu being 50.

155
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,500
this is where we look at the mean and

156
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,699
the variance

157
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,319
of this X on mu regression so for Mu

158
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,060
being 50

159
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,360
X is centered around negative six

160
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,460
with a variance that's just literally

161
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,380
the mean and the variance of this

162
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,020
scatter plot that's the empirical way to

163
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,120
say it would just be you just look at

164
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,699
the scatter points that are in this

165
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,680
column

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
and this is the gaussian

167
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,380
that's parameterized from this slice

168
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,199
so I I think so that that certainly

169
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,400
makes sense I think the question there

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,880
was so the the MU equals 50

171
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,699
um it's it's saying um I think it says

172
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,259
in the in the caption that it's sort of

173
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,780
over the over the expectation of the of

174
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,900
the music we look at the top right plots

175
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,940
that mu equals 50. it's not quite clear

176
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,160
where that is coming from

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,720
I agree I think having another

178
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
crosshairs here

179
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,060
to reflect that that was the B that that

180
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,280
gave us the 50 mu

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,940
the crosshairs being here

182
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,000
um it actually uh it does identify

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
across hairs here

184
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,639
and it identifies a

185
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,039
and then if B is negative uh five let's

186
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,500
just say

187
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,000
it identifies

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
back onto this line

189
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,139
a crosshairs right here which is at

190
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,479
surprise surprise

191
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,539
negative six plus or minus one

192
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,699
okay so really it's sort of flowing

193
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,979
around from top left it's saying the

194
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,860
average temperature outside is

195
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,020
-6 or thereabouts what does that

196
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,699
correspond to in terms of B what does

197
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,340
that correspond to in terms of mu and

198
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,660
then you get the distribution from that

199
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,599
yes perfect and that's how the market

200
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,240
blanket even though it's defined as no

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,660
uh no direct influence of internal and

202
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,240
external States no tele no telepathy no

203
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,539
telekinesis so all perception action

204
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,399
mediated through the blanket

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,919
yet we still are able to talk about

206
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,080
internal States as reflecting beliefs

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,600
about external States

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,240
but with this partition

209
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,540
and all of the partitioned States

210
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,459
internal external and blanket in the

211
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,740
simpler plural

212
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,060
partition

213
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,200
or

214
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,180
internal external with the friston

215
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,399
blanket with perception and cognition as

216
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,959
the two kind I mean sorry perception

217
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,779
action as the two kinds of blanket

218
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,920
States

219
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,959
so here's just a sensory example

220
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,100
awesome yeah any other thoughts or

221
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,080
question on this one

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,760
definitely helpful to have that

223
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,480
crosshairs

224
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,518
uh Amy

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,819
or Ali

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,160
uh well actually I think I kind of

227
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,720
disagree with

228
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,580
um

229
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,980
with the final conclusion that uh there

230
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,940
need to be a Crosshair in the top

231
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,120
um two diagrams because uh I don't know

232
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
I I might have

233
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,000
um misunderstood this but I think uh the

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,140
top two diagrams actually shows uh you

235
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,480
see here

236
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,959
uh one axis um it's just a blanket State

237
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,660
and the other axis is external and in

238
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,519
the other one is just the internal stage

239
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,220
so here I think

240
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,440
um

241
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,019
the blanket state is generated from

242
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,560
averaging over a generating function

243
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
that generates that blanket States

244
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,600
so but in the bottom left diagram we

245
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
deal with some specific States I mean

246
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,760
so for so for instance

247
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,019
um here

248
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,700
uh what exactly is the value of x when

249
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,940
the internal state is say 50 right but I

250
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,459
don't know if uh it makes sense to add

251
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,300
those crosshairs uh into the final

252
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,000
into the top two diagrams given that

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,779
they just show the

254
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,540
the statistical shape of the blank

255
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,720
Estates with respect to external States

256
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,060
and the internal States

257
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,500
so

258
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not sure where we uh

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,360
diverge in our conclusions but

260
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,380
um

261
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,839
yeah that I mean this figure as it is uh

262
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,500
somehow makes more sense to me than uh

263
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,420
if there's a there's some added

264
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,019
crosshairs in the top two diagrams

265
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,600
I think I hear you on this these are

266
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,240
learned conditional associations on the

267
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,820
top and this is the per this is the

268
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,240
actual particular inference question

269
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,540
so it doesn't necessarily

270
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,740
um

271
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,839
clarify it but it does kind of locate us

272
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,880
in point space

273
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,540
with x b and mu

274
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,079
since these are like different views on

275
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,420
the same particular partitioned system

276
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,060
Jonathan

277
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,459
yeah I think the the reason I think it's

278
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:24,540
important is because when it says here e

279
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,579
um the expectation value taken over the

280
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,800
distribution of mu given B

281
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,260
this is actually for a particular value

282
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,779
of B that has been chosen and from the

283
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,120
bottom left plot you can't see what that

284
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,220
b is it's actually for a specific value

285
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,660
of B if I understand correctly

286
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,139
yeah

287
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,420
it is definitely for for a specific

288
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,880
value so cool good question otherwise

289
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,440
this would have a different shape it

290
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,760
wouldn't just be a gaussian around this

291
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,959
it would be like kind of like a mountain

292
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,439
range

293
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,040
okay

294
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,019
just gonna

295
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,019
um

296
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,000
on page 52 the sum part gave me the

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,680
impression that perception is actually a

298
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,139
passive process it brings action to the

299
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,180
game but it is not active itself doesn't

300
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,719
make sense

301
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Maria do you want to add more or we'll

302
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,760
look at 52.

303
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,459
it's actually

304
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,660
the impression I had when I was reading

305
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,600
it so I'm not sure if I if I had the

306
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,420
wrong impression or just

307
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,139
um

308
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,980
the the right thing from Thomas park at

309
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,899
all is different from the writing from

310
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,480
Jacob Howie for instance because Jacob

311
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Howard would say that perception and

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,700
action is more or less the same thing

313
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,459
so I don't know

314
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,600
yeah

315
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,540
yeah this is a great and and uh subtle

316
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,620
point

317
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,720
so we're talking about

318
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,079
um generativity and action and

319
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,339
perception

320
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,260
are these the same or are there

321
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,680
distinguishments amongst them so

322
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,399
um

323
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,920
it's an enteroceptive

324
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,860
sensor with glucose or neuropeptide or

325
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,040
something and then we're doing inference

326
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,660
on our hunger status so that's

327
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,260
perception

328
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,579
um so for any given

329
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,160
beliefs about our hunger and for any

330
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
given Precision or any given

331
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,139
enteroceptive input we're going to get

332
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,480
like some surprise value

333
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,700
so surprise value is just how surprising

334
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,040
that data point is given the priors it's

335
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,620
in some information theoretic unit

336
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,199
so whether you're as minimally surprised

337
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,880
as you can be

338
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
or whether it's super surprising there's

339
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,220
some surprise value associated with that

340
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,820
observation

341
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,839
um

342
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,399
that

343
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,779
um that discrepancy that surprise value

344
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,600
can be seen as the um

345
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
the compromise between like this

346
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,100
actively generated

347
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,899
top-down prior

348
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,279
and and a received sensory information

349
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,839
so there's sort of a generativity

350
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,720
there's the tale of two densities

351
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,940
purely perceptually but we're not

352
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,180
talking about motion or movement yet

353
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,600
so perception can describe surprise

354
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,699
and you can learn

355
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,320
you could update you say oh maybe I am

356
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,360
hungry or maybe I'm not hungry

357
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,339
so you can modify your top down prior

358
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,760
which is like a form of covert action

359
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
to reduce surprise

360
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,660
however it is not

361
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,120
inactive action

362
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,940
so a purely perceptual like a predictive

363
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,600
processing model doesn't have to have

364
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,940
action like in live stream 43

365
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,980
um that Maria and I did

366
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,860
most of the paper was on the predictive

367
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,139
processing in the purely inferential

368
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,120
case so you're still a top-down priors

369
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,800
bottom-up information

370
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,779
and then just in like the last section

371
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,279
it's like okay now we're going to throw

372
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,320
in action as a parameter it's active

373
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,240
inference

374
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,339
so I think that this is saying in the

375
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,740
purely perceptual

376
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,079
predictive processing setting

377
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,180
it is still the case that surprise is

378
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,160
being like

379
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,380
um just conversationally actively

380
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,820
generated

381
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,060
but that active generativity or

382
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,399
responsivity of the predictive

383
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,160
processing hierarchy

384
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
is uh not necessarily exactly the same

385
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,160
as going out to get dessert

386
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,600
and inactive inference

387
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,220
there's like

388
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,959
the learning and perception way to

389
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,519
reduce free energy

390
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,139
and then there's the actual action

391
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,480
selection part

392
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
now there might be special cases where

393
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,339
the only actions that the agent has

394
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,959
are

395
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,439
internal or covert affordances like

396
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,760
attention and learning

397
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,939
but in the general case and in the most

398
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,740
um kind of manifest form of action

399
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,480
usually we're talking about bodily

400
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,780
action

401
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,720
does that address it Maria

402
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,620
yes I think that the main difference is

403
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,799
predictive processing and activities

404
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,639
that was microfusion

405
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,160
yeah because I had the impression that

406
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,559
perceptional perception was almost like

407
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,160
a computer that was Computing the KL

408
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,320
Divergence between beliefs and

409
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,080
Sensations whereas the action was

410
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,299
another thing but

411
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,020
you know

412
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,960
again I think that I was

413
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
misunderstanding the differences between

414
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,539
predictive processing and active

415
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,419
influence

416
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:15,120
yeah I mean they are um

417
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
active inference is a predictive coding

418
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,880
or predictive processing architecture

419
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,120
where manifest action or internal cover

420
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,320
action

421
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,960
is itself a parameter that we do that

422
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,220
kind of inference on

423
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,780
but you could also have a purely passive

424
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,260
predictive processing system

425
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,440
like no isocades but still talking about

426
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,919
priors and perception on vision

427
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,260
and then one could even argue that that

428
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,660
model still has like kind of this

429
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,640
generativity because there is the

430
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
top-down generated visual

431
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,120
um what is perceived

432
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,640
but that's not the same type of action

433
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,100
or the same level of embedding with

434
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,600
bodily action

435
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
as if your predictive processing model

436
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
of vision

437
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
included isocating

438
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,140
and so that's one of the important uh

439
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,700
developments

440
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,160
of active inference Beyond predictive

441
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,860
processing and Bayesian brain that's the

442
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,660
pragmatic turn

443
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,220
is like

444
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,200
yeah it's not just that there's this

445
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,240
generative model that's always learning

446
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,559
and updating

447
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,960
it's actually one of the features one of

448
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,780
the parameters in that generative model

449
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,039
has to be self in World consequences of

450
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,419
action

451
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,400
in Worlds

452
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,740
from a sensory perspective

453
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,360
because the main question that a

454
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,160
predictive processing model for example

455
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,780
a vision has to address

456
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,080
um if you're like in the machine

457
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,100
learning it's like well it has to

458
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,260
classify digits it's like okay yes it

459
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,220
does

460
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,539
but the bigger question is where to look

461
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,240
and that's the kind of model that

462
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,179
biological organisms are engaging with

463
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:08,460
where should I isocade and then yeah we

464
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,220
reduce our uncertainty about the visual

465
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,640
scene with isicating and then we could

466
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,919
classify the digits

467
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,980
but if we only set up the task as being

468
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,039
like digit classification

469
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,520
then it doesn't need to have this active

470
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,960
sampling

471
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,620
feature

472
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,640
um Ali

473
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,660
uh yeah I think uh slightly more nuanced

474
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,320
um distinction between uh predictive the

475
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,640
difference between the predictive

476
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,380
processing predictive coding and other

477
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,260
Frameworks with active inference uh is

478
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,220
laid out uh in chapter 10 especially the

479
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,320
beginning uh section 10.4 page 198 but

480
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,059
uh just very briefly

481
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,620
although in some predictive processing

482
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,440
Frameworks such as

483
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,539
embodied or action-based predictive

484
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,580
processing

485
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,500
perception and action can somehow be

486
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,419
correlated with each other

487
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,559
um if not exactly synonyms

488
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,679
to each one but in active inference uh

489
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,640
there's

490
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,600
um this subtle distinction that says

491
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,080
perception both perception and action

492
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,860
are inferential processes so they are

493
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,659
just analogous in terms of being

494
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,059
this kind of

495
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,740
inferential process so they're not

496
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,419
exactly equivalent to each other as some

497
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,600
predictive processing Advocates may

498
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,860
claim

499
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,460
great yes they're analogous in their

500
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,460
computational handling

501
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,679
but they're not

502
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,080
identical

503
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,539
they're not functionally or semantically

504
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,580
identical action and perception are

505
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,820
difference Concepts

506
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,380
but

507
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,500
we have a unified imperative

508
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,940
that that

509
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,159
talks about

510
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,280
perception slash learning and action

511
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,380
as both being in

512
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,440
the common

513
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,520
inferential game

514
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,760
of free energy minimization

515
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
which bounds surprise of the generative

516
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
model

517
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,640
um okay

518
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,020
um

519
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,700
a short question does agent need

520
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,039
awareness of preferences can preferences

521
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,480
be learned I think this may have came up

522
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
at a uh

523
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
um office hours

524
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,539
so does the agent need like experiential

525
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,059
awareness of preference

526
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,520
you can construct models that have this

527
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
feature

528
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,100
but it's not a feature of the kernel of

529
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,500
the model so single layer active model

530
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,760
no you don't need to even go there but

531
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,919
you could make a nested model where the

532
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,340
higher layer is like attention or meta

533
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,900
awareness

534
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,559
can preferences be learned yes here's a

535
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,200
paper of Sajid at all preference

536
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
learning in general though is a very

537
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,919
challenging problem

538
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,799
because what if you

539
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,260
um how do you even know what you would

540
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,140
want to learn

541
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,440
so it also quickly moves into this kind

542
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,340
of like hierarchical modeling setting

543
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,960
where

544
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,120
when you write out the model you'll have

545
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,220
a lot of clarity about what is being

546
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,780
learned and what isn't being learned but

547
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,240
in the general

548
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,320
um kind of pre-model specification space

549
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,600
these questions as with many many others

550
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,600
it's like in principle yeah you could

551
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
whether is or isn't that is going to be

552
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,380
about any specific model

553
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,100
but it's a great question

554
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,080
okay other upvoted ones and then we'll

555
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,620
continue down

556
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,500
is there a minimal example of a thing

557
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,960
defined by a Marco blanket

558
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,240
for example a cell seems to satisfy such

559
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,220
definition same with proteins and other

560
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,840
structures

561
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,059
is it correct to say a thing is just the

562
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,559
temporary Persistence of a markout

563
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,580
blanket

564
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,559
are all things then just non-equilibrium

565
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,799
steady state processes as per figure 3.3

566
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,620
do we need to be more strict in saying

567
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,539
these things are only self-evancing

568
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,740
things rather than things in the

569
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,900
colloquial sense

570
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,460
who has any thought on this

571
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,539
I'm sure there's a

572
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,360
many takes slash ways to say it but the

573
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,940
only piece I would add here

574
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,880
a thing is the modeled or measured

575
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,580
Persistence of a Markov blanket because

576
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,520
Markov blankets exist on maps Markov

577
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,520
blankets are features of Base graphs

578
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,039
there are common features of Base graphs

579
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,140
every base graph

580
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,419
where it's not fully connected

581
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,520
so anytime there are nodes that aren't

582
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
directly connected

583
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,140
there are Markov blankets that insulate

584
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,059
those two sets of nodes so it's actually

585
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:49,020
like not a rare or exciting

586
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,500
uh event on base graphs and also it

587
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,380
doesn't necessarily

588
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,179
demarcate the spatial temporal

589
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,279
boundaries of an embodied agent

590
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,460
the thing as we're going to be

591
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,200
talking about it

592
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,460
is

593
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,740
for the given spatial and temporal scale

594
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,720
and signal to noise and all of that that

595
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,159
the Observer

596
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,059
is using

597
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,700
if it's identifiable as a thing

598
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,520
even a process thing like a river or

599
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,480
something

600
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,159
to The Observer then yes it had to have

601
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,679
persisted as that thing

602
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,200
within that spatial and temporal scale

603
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,120
that the modeler was making that map of

604
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,080
so

605
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,840
maps are not Observer independent Mark

606
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,620
all blankets are on maps yes every

607
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,960
level of organization

608
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,720
end of a multi-scale complex systems

609
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,919
will fit that definition

610
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,299
are all things non-equilibrium steady

611
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,039
state processes

612
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,960
do we need to be more strict in saying

613
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,520
these things are only self-evidencing

614
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,980
brings us to our favorite

615
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,419
image

616
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,500
in the um

617
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,140
strange kinds article so there are

618
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,140
things or particles here particle is the

619
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,580
same as thing

620
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,240
that are inert and so no appeal to

621
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,179
self-evidising is needed to describe

622
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,960
their persistence

623
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,080
um or yeah I'll say that

624
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,020
um there are octave particles

625
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,900
whose actions can be understood

626
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,240
as self-evidencing

627
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,340
again without an appeal to awareness or

628
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,020
a Consciousness or anything like that

629
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,779
and this is what is called sentience

630
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,440
cueing the ongoing debate again so not

631
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,179
qualiosentience but sensing and

632
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,159
adaptively acting

633
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,779
such as

634
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,240
um some uh

635
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,179
like the wood lice that Carl identified

636
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,760
in his childhood where they were walking

637
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,440
faster in the Sun and slower in the

638
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,820
shades so they spent more time in the

639
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,320
shade

640
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,900
and then self-evidencing in the case of

641
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,919
these sophisticated or strange particles

642
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,980
the self-evidencing includes like self

643
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,120
in world with others like me

644
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,419
under nested counterfactuals

645
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,940
so that's not present in the base of the

646
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,140
model

647
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,659
but the base models that we are going to

648
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:34,740
be looking at

649
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,380
especially in like the upcoming chapter

650
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,440
this is like the Lego block

651
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,039
that these much much more sophisticated

652
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,440
models are built upon

653
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,299
Scott if for some reason I want to model

654
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,039
a rock using this framework I would

655
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,600
probably model it as an inert particle

656
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,539
yeah absolutely you could even just draw

657
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,600
out the particular partition

658
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,159
um

659
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,159
here's the the photons coming off of The

660
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,299
Rock

661
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,100
and they're determined by this other

662
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,980
action impinging on the Rock and here's

663
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,539
my inference on The Rock's weight or

664
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,980
here's the rock on the scale whatever

665
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,179
situation you're going to be talking

666
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,740
about it

667
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,200
um yes it's partitioned from its

668
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,100
environment

669
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,179
and it's not taking action selection

670
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,159
or one could see its action selection

671
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,039
choice to stay in one location as like

672
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,679
the simplest case of Bayesian mechanics

673
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,960
just like a a rock physically being in

674
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,460
one location is the simplest location

675
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,919
thing of uh of simpler than something

676
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,539
falling

677
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,640
a belief just existing in one location

678
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,919
is simpler than it moving

679
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,320
Ali

680
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,779
yeah uh yeah I think we should probably

681
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,260
point out uh the notion of uh blanket

682
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,840
index here as well because

683
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,559
um

684
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,779
you see Marco blanket is not something

685
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:02,720
predefined or even uh an established

686
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,899
value because we can Define markup

687
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,299
blankets

688
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:12,480
depending on how complex the system is

689
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,740
and by complex here I mean uh it's uh

690
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,480
more or less precise mathematical

691
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,659
definition I mean

692
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,940
so for

693
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,700
as the system becomes more complex and

694
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,360
in a more in higher dimensional systems

695
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,299
uh or in other words when uh the system

696
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,100
has a sparse coupling with its

697
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,480
environment the markup the blanket index

698
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,539
approaches zero but in less complex

699
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,299
system or in other words in the systems

700
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,899
that uh doesn't necessarily have this

701
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:52,880
kind of

702
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,100
non-linearity embedded in them and they

703
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,880
behave more as linear systems uh the

704
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,320
mark the blanket index and maximizes so

705
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,340
yeah it's uh and it's it's a kind of a

706
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,340
spectrum and we can have different

707
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,299
levels of uh weakness or um

708
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,700
blanket index uh

709
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,460
embedded to the definition of our markup

710
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,039
blanket yes thank you yeah this is

711
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,899
recent uh some advancements and uh but

712
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,539
there's a lot of other like discussion

713
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,039
of well what about when it's shifting

714
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,080
materiality of the boundary or what

715
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,700
kinds of and it just

716
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,279
there's a lot more to say but it's

717
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,720
always good to remember the markup

718
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,179
blanket it's not like internal external

719
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,980
blanket states are pre-assigned about

720
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,600
the world their base graph

721
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,059
partitions so the partitions on a given

722
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,580
constructed map never the territory it's

723
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,620
just a total

724
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,140
um apples and oranges

725
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,620
apples and maps of Apple's question mark

726
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,659
out blankets just like simply are not in

727
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,159
the world

728
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,820
that's a good first angle and then we

729
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,159
can talk more about like which thing is

730
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,500
the person modeling and what kind of

731
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,299
particle are they modeling it as and so

732
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,500
on

733
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,140
but just helps to like instantly jump a

734
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,580
two feet into the modeling question

735
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,899
which is where you are when you're

736
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,480
talking about the Markov blankets

737
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,640
um rather than in the underlying

738
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,860
ontological

739
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,960
what is the the true substance of what

740
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,880
the thing is

741
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
which is actually still a question that

742
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,000
many people have found that the Marcon

743
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,080
blanket

744
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,960
helps them get around

745
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,539
not to bypass but like to to be sense

746
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,340
making in that space

747
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,840
so it's not even that it isn't useful

748
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,980
for that space it's just that the

749
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,720
markout blanket is something about base

750
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
graphs not about whatever territory

751
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,559
you're trying to describe with these

752
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,860
graphs

753
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,720
um living organisms resolve

754
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,820
this fundamental biological Problems by

755
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,140
exerting active control over their

756
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,360
states which range from

757
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,539
every biological mechanism in the world

758
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,519
is a way to understand why automatic

759
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,320
mechanisms are active in thinking that

760
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,240
these still involve calculating efe over

761
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,000
future States but the time Horizon of

762
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,760
automatic reflexive behaviors is small

763
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
is there another concept of passive

764
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,100
control or is all control active

765
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,880
so and then there's an example provided

766
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,799
involving like a the so-called reflex

767
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,860
arc so a few answers here first in

768
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,360
chapter five

769
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,179
we will be looking forward to that

770
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,640
essentially exact example where

771
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,399
depending on the dopaminergic Precision

772
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,200
and tone

773
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,840
in this dopaminergic region of the

774
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,340
mammalian brain

775
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,260
there's going to be two

776
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,679
Paths of policy selection

777
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,779
there's going to be one path of policy

778
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,419
selection that basically passes habits

779
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,440
forward

780
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,940
and there's going to be another path of

781
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,980
policy selection where expected free

782
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,480
energy G is used to sharpen action

783
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,540
priors habits into

784
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,540
action or policy posteriors which are

785
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,800
updated

786
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,179
and

787
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,159
um sharpened according to the extent

788
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,639
that they serve to minimize free energy

789
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,560
so that's a dopaminergic mediated

790
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,599
handoff between like what might be seen

791
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,460
as sort of just habitual

792
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,080
passing forward what has been done

793
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,859
versus taking a different lens according

794
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,500
to a defined G functional

795
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,780
and then to the question of the kettle

796
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,520
here's a predictive processing

797
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,918
architecture by which

798
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,199
um the spinal cord this is like a cross

799
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,300
section of a mammal spinal cord with a

800
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,699
butterfly shape

801
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,280
incoming sensory data can be reflexively

802
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,800
acted upon without getting passed into

803
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,599
this entire cortical hierarchy

804
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,280
one key piece to remember just like

805
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,380
Markov blankets are about maps not

806
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,079
territories generative models calculate

807
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,500
expected free energy not organisms

808
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,300
so

809
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,920
is there a way to think about it that it

810
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,200
involves calculating efe yeah if you

811
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,599
write the generative model so that um

812
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,119
blood pressure regulation involves an

813
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,820
efe calculation the answer is yes if you

814
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,040
write the generative model so that blood

815
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,079
glucose or blood pressure regulation

816
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,680
does not involve efe the answer is no so

817
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,140
in principle anything's possible but

818
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,579
when it really comes down to it it's

819
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:39,780
always going to be about how you

820
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,640
specified your generative model or your

821
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,980
thought experiment

822
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,599
is there another concept of passive

823
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,579
control or is all control active

824
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,420
anyone can also give a thought on this

825
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,240
but some um might say like control

826
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,099
theory is the application of action

827
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,200
that's the line between like signals

828
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,700
processing

829
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,420
and control theory if you uh you really

830
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,599
like the temperature to be uh 25c and

831
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,160
you have a Time series model or

832
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,660
variational Auto encoder of temperature

833
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,060
all these different things and then

834
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,619
sometimes you're like oh it's 25 it's

835
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,060
perfect other times it's too hot or too

836
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,040
cold like so you're in the single

837
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,240
processing world and you still might

838
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,800
have a preference about what signals

839
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,180
you're coming

840
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,560
um to infer

841
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,540
but this kind of comes to Maria's

842
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,339
question from earlier

843
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,800
there's a and so that can still be a

844
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,260
predictive processing architecture but

845
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,540
when we're talking about control even

846
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,339
though this term often has connotations

847
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,839
of like

848
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,300
um commandeering or like excessive

849
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,579
control that's just a cultural

850
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,960
connotation

851
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,780
it's really the distinction between a

852
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,460
signal processing perceptual only model

853
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,500
which still can have that Tale of Two

854
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,880
densities

855
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,460
and then what is called control theory

856
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,500
which is basically any introduction of

857
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,420
Behavior

858
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,820
and that introduces like well why are we

859
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,099
acting well two in this framework not

860
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,700
maximize reward According to some

861
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,460
proposed reward function but to reduce

862
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,000
the Divergence between our sensory

863
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,280
observations and our preferred sensory

864
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,880
observations

865
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,680
foreign

866
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,640
model evidence py

867
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,839
is mathematically

868
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,240
maximizing model evidence P of Y

869
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,099
so we have a portfolio we have a given

870
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,839
data set why

871
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,119
and we're going to have a portfolio of

872
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,040
models

873
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,339
each model can then be said to have a

874
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,200
certain amount of evidence in the sense

875
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,720
like it corresponds to could generate

876
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,880
that data better or it recognizes that

877
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,920
data with less variance

878
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,579
and we want to select in this situation

879
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,380
the model from our portfolio or like

880
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,780
families of models that we swept over we

881
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,160
want to select the models that have the

882
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,800
highest model evidence

883
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,440
and that is equivalent to being to

884
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,000
selecting the model

885
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,180
that minimizes our surprise about

886
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,880
incoming sensory observations

887
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,200
so it's like

888
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,599
if temperatures being generated a

889
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,280
certain way we have certain temperature

890
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,720
data set

891
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,700
one way to think about this problem is

892
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,380
we want to select the mean and the

893
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,900
variance for the gaussian

894
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,119
that have the most evidence with respect

895
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,160
to the data we have

896
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,020
another way to think about this exact

897
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,160
same situation is we want the gaussian

898
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,359
such that surprise is minimized as new

899
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,560
observations come in

900
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,220
surprise is defined as the negative

901
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,460
natural log of model evidence

902
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,079
which has like a lot of features and

903
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,220
we'll kind of come back again and again

904
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,560
to these

905
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,119
features of logs

906
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,119
and then as to the specific question

907
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,940
um it's a sometimes we call it a fancy I

908
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,820
but it's called fracture

909
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,000
so it's a i for information even though

910
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,980
it looks kind of like a j

911
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,020
but it's fracture is the name of the

912
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,619
fonts family

913
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,880
importantly the agent's generative model

914
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,420
cannot simply mimic external Dynamics

915
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,520
what is meant by this statement

916
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,260
does this mean the agent's prior does

917
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,880
not need to be updated since it has a

918
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,560
perfect model already

919
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,660
if so how could an agent Define by their

920
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,339
generative model in the markup blanket

921
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,440
have a perfect model

922
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,500
when what is available is um its local

923
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,060
sensory States

924
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,599
okay

925
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,540
um

926
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,839
this is in the neighborhood of the good

927
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,079
regulator theorem from cybernetics so

928
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,200
adaptive cybernetic systems have to be

929
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,880
able to have like the requisite

930
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,940
diversity but also the ability to be

931
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,040
good Regulators which means that they

932
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,000
have to

933
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
uh not necessarily make like a digital

934
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,320
twin

935
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,900
cognitive model of their environment

936
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,000
it doesn't need to be uh bit for bit

937
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,820
Adam for atom recapitulated

938
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,140
however

939
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,800
in challenging environments

940
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
the agent will have to act as if it

941
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,720
contains a generative model that

942
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,820
includes some of the latent and

943
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,660
unfolding features of the niche

944
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,040
so

945
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,180
um

946
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,359
again the temperature example

947
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,940
if our only imperative of the generative

948
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,800
model was to fit temperatures accurately

949
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,720
as possible

950
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,280
you would just fit temperature

951
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,260
accurately as possible and then when it

952
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,240
left your physiological balance you just

953
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,220
die so we wouldn't see that kind of

954
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,440
organism around

955
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,740
so the agent's generative model

956
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,160
has this dual imperative of accurate but

957
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,500
not overfit perception

958
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,980
and adaptive action that's the synthesis

959
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,420
of the signals and information

960
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,540
processing incoming side with the action

961
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,760
selection control theoretic outgoing

962
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,020
side

963
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,380
because simply mimicking will not lead

964
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,960
to adaptivity

965
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,880
it's just not

966
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,560
what

967
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,619
adoptive agents need or want to do but

968
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,099
you can contrive an in silico example

969
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,960
where it does have a perfect internal

970
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,320
model of the external States

971
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,520
or it could be a fully observable

972
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,040
situation like a game of chess where

973
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,800
like the board is fully observable now

974
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,359
you can't observe into your opponent's

975
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,040
mind but again you could imagine an in

976
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,619
silica environment where like there was

977
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,380
that kind of visibility

978
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,339
um

979
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:14,640
so there's other aspects to this but

980
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,400
basically the agents generative model

981
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,359
doesn't have to be the exact

982
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:23,400
structure of the external world like

983
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,660
temperature in the world could be a

984
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,280
continuous variable and the agent

985
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,500
generative model could just be like too

986
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,599
hot too cold or just right

987
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,760
so it doesn't need to mimic the

988
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,520
structure of the external world

989
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,920
but there has to be some semantic

990
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,440
resemblance if temperatures indeed

991
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,560
something that is relevant for survival

992
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,660
there's gonna have to be something like

993
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,599
an as if

994
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,359
Thermo modeler and again it doesn't need

995
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,859
to be lockstep it doesn't mean that it's

996
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,359
just recapitulating the internal

997
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,619
Dynamics

998
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,560
but it has to have a cognitive structure

999
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
that allows it to have actionable

1000
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,000
um

1001
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,400
a representation of the external

1002
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,359
temperature

1003
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,119
including like the the consequences of

1004
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,520
different actions

1005
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,839
because it's not just a purely

1006
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,000
descriptive model it's also needing to

1007
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,520
take actions

1008
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,859
but as we um

1009
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,900
saw in chapter 2

1010
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,760
there's special cases when there's

1011
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,339
nothing to know or nothing to learn

1012
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:39,720
then you have utility oriented policy

1013
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,119
and if there's no differences in

1014
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,880
pragmatic utility for different outcomes

1015
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
then you have like novelty or

1016
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,040
information driven policy

1017
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,980
so in principle a huge number of special

1018
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,240
cases Can Be Imagined

1019
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,980
but in general it's not the case that

1020
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,040
the GM simply mimics external dynamics

1021
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,380
that would be a contrived setting

1022
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,319
yeah

1023
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,660
is more complex and itinerant Dynamics

1024
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,000
referring to concepts of multi-stability

1025
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,160
meta stability criticality yes

1026
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,140
definitely

1027
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,780
everything with complexity science

1028
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,140
and itinerant Dynamics just like

1029
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,000
continuing to wander maybe never even

1030
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,599
revisiting maybe revisiting

1031
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,760
multiple tractors

1032
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,339
conditional attractors

1033
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,859
phase transitions all of these kinds of

1034
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:47,119
topics so great question

1035
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,319
is it correct to say that Gibbs free

1036
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,420
energy and helmholtz free energy belong

1037
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,760
to the context of equilibrium stat

1038
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,640
Thermo and variational free energy

1039
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,079
belongs to the context of

1040
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,980
non-equilibrium thermodynamics

1041
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,700
um for a disciplinary answer

1042
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,359
ask someone who knows and cares

1043
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:21,000
inbox 3.2

1044
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,400
what they're highlighting is not

1045
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,579
necessarily the difference between

1046
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:27,720
equilibrium and non-equilibrium though

1047
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,240
that distinction is here

1048
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,220
rather I believe that they're

1049
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,900
highlighting that variational and

1050
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,819
expected free energy

1051
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,960
are information theoretic quantities

1052
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,700
whereas Gibbs free energy describes like

1053
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,020
how much

1054
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,680
um

1055
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,380
calories of heat are released when the

1056
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,859
candle is burnt

1057
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:51,240
and so we say oh the candle is burning

1058
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,520
it's reducing free energy it gives free

1059
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
energy that's what made it an

1060
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,480
irreversible reaction or spontaneous

1061
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,060
reaction but the variational and

1062
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,740
expected free energy are in information

1063
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,660
geometric spaces

1064
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,900
they're not referring to the same exact

1065
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,300
reference of thermodynamic systems like

1066
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,640
heat bath steam engine

1067
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,319
and so on

1068
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:15,599
it gets blurry because some people are

1069
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,619
really

1070
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,160
um pushing like pan cognitivist pan

1071
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,560
information list it from bit

1072
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,760
and so people do discuss some

1073
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,260
relationships at very deep levels

1074
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,480
between for example information engines

1075
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,099
and heat engines

1076
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,579
so it's a deep hole to go into but just

1077
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,520
from the outside Gibbs free energy is

1078
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,980
talking about candles burning

1079
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,300
variational free energy is talking about

1080
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,040
informational

1081
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,460
bomb systems Ali

1082
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,660
yeah uh well again uh going back to uh

1083
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,680
what we talked in the previous cohort

1084
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,960
um actually in the last uh couple of

1085
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,540
years there's this

1086
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,800
uh push towards a developing a kind of

1087
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,020
new mathematical formulation of active

1088
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,560
inference which doesn't require the nest

1089
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,980
assumption as it's required as its

1090
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,079
precondition so

1091
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,720
um

1092
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,740
previously and especially from about

1093
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,859
2012 to 2019 most of the active

1094
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,400
influence literature was focused on

1095
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,040
developing the density Over States

1096
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,180
formulation but in the last couple of

1097
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,420
years the trend has shifted toward

1098
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,440
developing the

1099
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,619
density overpath formulation density or

1100
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,420
past formulation of active inference

1101
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,900
which it doesn't necessarily require uh

1102
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,800
NES assumptions so in its most current

1103
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,680
formulation we can say that active

1104
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,900
inference is much more General and also

1105
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,119
includes

1106
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,540
even the systems that doesn't obey the

1107
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,500
NASA assumption or requirements

1108
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,180
yes

1109
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,899
great

1110
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,900
and then last question and then we'll

1111
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,720
look ahead to the coming chapter

1112
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,579
um okay

1113
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,619
how does the taking of drugs which flow

1114
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:30,119
across the blanket and directly affect

1115
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,220
the internal States and therefore GM fit

1116
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,900
within the framework I.E the blanket is

1117
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,359
semi-permeable it is not only sensory

1118
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,220
and active so

1119
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,859
blankets are not in the world

1120
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:43,859
you could model and make a model where

1121
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:46,500
for example the blood-brain barrier is

1122
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,920
like uh blanket States and then the

1123
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,480
question points out right there are

1124
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,460
actually the materiality of certain

1125
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,079
substances

1126
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,560
is such that just because one state was

1127
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,560
internal with respect to photons

1128
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,300
in my map

1129
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,000
doesn't mean it's internal or secluded

1130
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,180
with respect to some lipophilic drug

1131
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,200
so

1132
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,780
if you draw out the base graph

1133
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,839
like what you're actually talking about

1134
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,480
in terms of the base graph of what what

1135
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,520
information flow because the base graph

1136
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,800
is not identifying the spatial temporal

1137
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,200
or the lipid bilayers

1138
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,540
it's not just Anatomy it's actually more

1139
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,119
like an informational physiology because

1140
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,099
it's describing connections amongst

1141
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:35,579
different parameters in the map not

1142
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:36,839
necessarily different like physical

1143
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,780
articulations in the anatomy

1144
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,180
however more broadly like this concept

1145
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,060
of semi-permeability that is being

1146
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,880
addressed with the blanket indexed

1147
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,240
and as well as Dynamic blankets

1148
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,099
and it's not sensory in active states

1149
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,480
which affect the internal States in

1150
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,940
reality again

1151
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,760
in the reality of the particular

1152
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,160
partition on the base graph

1153
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,800
this is the definition of what the

1154
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,660
blankets are

1155
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,680
however whether the labeled and assigned

1156
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,660
nodes in the map

1157
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,359
have this or that relationship

1158
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,240
to different embodied territories

1159
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,900
is the map territory question

1160
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,480
so we can definitely return to these

1161
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,180
topics but I think by drawing out a base

1162
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,460
graph there'd be a lot of clarity around

1163
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,319
like what is internal or external to

1164
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,180
what it's not like there's like a

1165
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,380
highlighter that you can just tag

1166
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,180
objects in the world this is an internal

1167
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,380
State and that's an external State and

1168
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,040
that's a blanket

1169
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,859
awesome yes

1170
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,900
it's like correlation is not causation

1171
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,240
there's just a few

1172
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,819
where on like the the 700th time hearing

1173
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,500
it's like oh

1174
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,400
I guess it is

1175
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:56,940
okay

1176
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,020
let's look ahead to chapter four so

1177
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,980
we are in

1178
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,099
chapter three

1179
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,579
High Road

1180
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,740
notice that chapter 2 and chapter 3 are

1181
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,140
the low road and the high road to octave

1182
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,240
inference so

1183
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,900
we haven't begun active yet but we've

1184
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,819
gotten to there but right when we were

1185
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:22,380
on the outskirts of the city we like

1186
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,000
pulled away

1187
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,740
um I I don't know not not really but

1188
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,680
kind of chapter four is the generative

1189
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,359
models of active inference so this is

1190
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:31,800
going to be like the heart of active

1191
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,940
inference

1192
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,700
after we've taken it from these two

1193
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,000
um roads the low road is the how

1194
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,700
with a Bayesian statistics which doesn't

1195
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,220
have to be about adaptive Auto poetic

1196
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,839
anything Bayesian statistics could just

1197
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,000
be about the temperature

1198
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,160
and then we talked about it from The

1199
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,740
High Road perspective this imperative

1200
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,099
for self-organization and persistence

1201
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,079
which doesn't have to be implemented

1202
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,420
with Bayesian statistics

1203
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,420
these two roads come together

1204
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,220
in the generative models that we

1205
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,920
construct in active inference which use

1206
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,319
the Bayesian statistics

1207
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,420
and Implement a Bayesian mechanics

1208
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,839
chapter 4 complements the previous

1209
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:20,880
conceptual treatments with a more formal

1210
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,119
treatment

1211
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,059
we're going to be talking about free

1212
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,220
energy and Bayesian inference

1213
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,619
and specifically the generative models

1214
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,339
that are used in active inference

1215
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:39,900
4.2 Bayesian inference to free energy

1216
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,240
um previously there was a broad framing

1217
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,960
with a Bayesian brain which has been

1218
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,680
accepted

1219
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,720
for some decades

1220
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,000
if anyone has like a doubt or comes

1221
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,119
across a doubting person for sure ask

1222
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,740
for an alternative and always be open

1223
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,359
but it's like as opposed to what the

1224
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,339
frequentest brain

1225
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:02,819
so Bayesian brain is a natural

1226
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,680
framing

1227
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,740
not too constraining at all it just

1228
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,839
brings Neuroscience in line with modern

1229
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,460
statistical methods

1230
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,819
and if we take the inactive turn or the

1231
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,200
pragmatic turn

1232
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,020
we want Bayesian brain plus action

1233
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,520
which is basically octave inference

1234
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,780
um they're going to return to base

1235
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,559
theorem

1236
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,400
figure 4.1

1237
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,839
we're going to have a bit of a

1238
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,420
discussion on Jensen's inequality

1239
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,079
and some properties of logs so for any

1240
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:41,160
of the current or X math professors

1241
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,720
in this group

1242
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,660
any thoughts you have on logs and

1243
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,760
Jensen's inequality would be helpful but

1244
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,780
we're going to come back to it

1245
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,740
um

1246
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,420
more equations

1247
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,940
some transformations of logs and model

1248
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,180
evidence yes exactly the two people

1249
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,359
who I reference sounds great

1250
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,400
um

1251
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,920
that log discussion is going to yield

1252
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,740
the KL Divergence

1253
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,020
section 4.3 is going to be about

1254
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,880
generative models so to calculate free

1255
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,680
energy we need three things

1256
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,119
a data

1257
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,800
a family of variational distributions

1258
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,480
and a generative model

1259
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,619
so

1260
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:27,359
well the cell is minimizing free energy

1261
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,940
it's like does the cell consist of data

1262
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,380
a family of variational distributions

1263
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,020
and a generative model no oh it's lipids

1264
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,180
and proteins okay it's not minimizing

1265
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,559
free energy

1266
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,260
your statistical model of the cell

1267
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,180
consisting of these three ingredients

1268
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,579
can minimize free energy

1269
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:49,260
so that's like a key map territory piece

1270
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,180
figure 4.2 is going to be like a

1271
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,280
step-by-step walkthrough

1272
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,220
really really helpful to think about

1273
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,940
this grammar of Bayesian causal graphs

1274
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,680
this is like one event that causes

1275
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,420
another event this is like one event

1276
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,400
that causes two events

1277
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,500
this is like two things that cause one

1278
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,200
outcome and this is like a chain of V

1279
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,839
causing X causing y so you can think

1280
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:14,700
about examples in our own life but this

1281
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,059
is like the grammar of what these nodes

1282
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:22,339
and edges mean in base graphs

1283
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,339
figure 4.3 is a classic figure

1284
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:29,099
it displays on the top the discrete time

1285
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,380
generative model in active inference

1286
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,839
which is called partially observable

1287
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,760
because there's this hidden state in

1288
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,140
observations

1289
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,940
and it's called a Markov decision

1290
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,040
process because there's this markovian

1291
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,720
time property

1292
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,220
which means that the past only

1293
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,839
influences the future through the

1294
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,680
present

1295
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,420
and it's a decision process because

1296
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,880
there's this control theory aspect so

1297
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,619
that's a partially observable Markov

1298
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,020
decision process and then on the bottom

1299
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,660
is a continuous time generative model

1300
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,520
discrete time is focused in chapter

1301
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,660
seven

1302
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,800
continuous time is focused in chapter 8.

1303
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,760
4.4 is a precursor to chapter seven it's

1304
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,319
about octave inference in discrete time

1305
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,020
more details 4.5 is a precursor to 8.

1306
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,359
it's a precursor to talking more about

1307
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,240
continuous time generative models

1308
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,339
some more details on Marco blankets

1309
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,579
continuous time models

1310
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:34,980
generalized coordinates of motion

1311
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,440
comes up a lot it's like instead of just

1312
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,839
representing the location in GPS of the

1313
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,500
car it's like location and all of its

1314
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,440
derivatives so its velocity acceleration

1315
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,020
and so on that turns out to be really

1316
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,359
important for certain dynamical systems

1317
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:56,280
back to imp as predictive coding Plus

1318
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,940
Motor action

1319
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,940
we'll unpack some of these figures

1320
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,680
and summary

1321
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,059
so chapter 4 gets to the two big

1322
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,040
families of generative models that are

1323
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,480
used in active inference so everything

1324
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,040
we've been talking about with generative

1325
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,480
models

1326
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,460
the two biggest families like

1327
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,040
vertebrates and invertebrates

1328
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,640
or any other taxonomic division you want

1329
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,740
are basically represented in figure 4.3

1330
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,780
and they can be hybridized too which

1331
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,579
happens in chapter eight

1332
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,099
so that's chapter four

1333
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:33,839
we will um

1334
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,420
return next week

1335
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,579
go through the chapter looking forward

1336
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:39,480
to

1337
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,819
any questions um and last Point Jonathan

1338
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,380
there's a lot in chapter four have you

1339
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,640
found two weeks I've been sufficient to

1340
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,619
get the grips with it yes various

1341
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,000
chapters

1342
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,980
like

1343
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,020
it's it's one reason why we take the

1344
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,180
cohorts multiple times

1345
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,040
because it's not just two weeks it's not

1346
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,300
like if it were just six weeks there'd

1347
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,880
be enough to get to grips with it

1348
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,220
necessarily so going through it multiple

1349
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,780
times

1350
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,040
and uh just carrying on with the pace

1351
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,020
we're not grading or testing obviously

1352
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:14,059
so just continuing on

1353
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,020
yeah only two weeks deep ramju

1354
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,520
um so just carrying on with the schedule

1355
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,200
and just

1356
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,420
trying but but if but we can definitely

1357
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,160
think more about this
