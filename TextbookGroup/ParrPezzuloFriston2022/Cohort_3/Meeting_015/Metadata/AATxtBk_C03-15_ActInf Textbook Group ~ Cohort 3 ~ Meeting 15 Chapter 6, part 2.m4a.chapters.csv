800	84440	00:00	It's June 20, 2023. We're in our second discussion on chapter six. First just have any general comments or anything. Then we'll turn to the questions table and look at what questions we didn't get to last time.	We're in our second discussion on chapter six, right?	General Comments on Chapter 6
97370	894650	01:37	Is there a common or good representation or rubric for evaluating Generative Model Generative process? Anyone want to give a first thought or just some other related question?	Is there a good representation or rubric for evaluating Generative Model Generative process	Meeting the Evaluation Criteria for Generative Models and Generative
895900	1200110	14:55	Good regulator theorem originally stated every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system. Information processing, sense making, decision making has a non zero informational cost land hour limit. How do we operationalize regulation in this setting?	Good regulator theorem says every good regulator must contain a model of system	Good Regulator Theorem in Cybernetics
1204320	1980860	20:04	How can organs other than the brain be making inferences? The same mathematical technology can be applied both to inert rocks as well as the brain. There might be a setting where scientific realism is more justified.	How can organs other than the brain be making inferences	Inference in the brain and other systems
1988950	2274800	33:08	What is the role of precision in nested models? Well, here and also by way of demonstrating the transferability of active inference generative models. Precision and nested modeling is basically like the general precision concept, which is basically used everywhere.	What is the role of precision in nested models? Well, here are three examples	What is the role of precision in nested models
2284360	2545330	38:04	The idea of selecting between alternative futures defined by sequences of actions is more simply articulated using discrete time models. The continuous time generative model is actually not explicitly modeling past, present, future time steps. These models can be hybridized and fused, which is in chapter eight.	The choice between discrete and continuous models is largely tied up with policy selection	Inclination to a discrete or continuous time model
2553510	2736370	42:33	 temporal depth is how many timesteps the model is considered in the discrete time case. Why is temporal depth specific to planning? Does temporal depth in perception make any sense?	How is temporal depth specific to planning? Does temporal depth in perception make any sense	Inferring from planning as inference
2749580	2989090	45:49	There's no backwards arrow from external to active or from internal to sensory. Only other constraint is no telepathy. Would that allow us to model Turing equivalents? I believe it's possible.	Figure 6 shows mutual interaction between active states and sensory states	Turing architecture and the cognitive sciences
2994230	3347760	49:54	In models that include continuous or discrete variables or both, what is meant by variable states or observations? If the external state is unknowable, how can we set up a generative process? Are we not introducing information to the model that would not be available in the real world?	We're in models that include continuous or discrete variables or both	The challenge of generative models
3350740	3379528	55:50	Thank you, fellows. Looking forward to next discussions and into heading into chapter seven next week. Maybe we'll do our zero for chapter seven and eight, but not in a hurry. Sure.	Looking forward to next discussions and into heading into chapter seven next week	A New Chapter 7 Discussion
