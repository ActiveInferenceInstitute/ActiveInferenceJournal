1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,760
all right hello everyone

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,940
it's February 1st 2023

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,880
and we're in

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,820
cohort three of the paradol textbook

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,780
group

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,639
meeting number two

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,400
we're having our first discussion on

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,500
chapter one

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,039
so

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,800
would anybody like to just give any

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,160
opening thoughts or comments

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,520
anything that they expected preferred

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,980
enjoyed remembered

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,680
about chapter one like what was

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,320
something they were expecting and got or

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,239
didn't or something that stuck with them

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,879
about the experience of chapter one

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,320
you can raise your hand or just go for

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,440
it

20
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,880
how about oh yes please go for it

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,260
someone or

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,060
Chance favors the prepared mind

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,060
my sense was that it gave a kind of

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,220
overview but

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,000
um

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
uh it

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
I I spent my time looking at chapter two

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,799
because it kind of gives us broad

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,460
overview but you feel the meat is in the

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,979
the rest of the book

31
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,700
so I was bogged down and uh

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,540
maths of chapter two

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,200
awesome yes thank you

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,439
and I'll copy your comment in Jonathan

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,299
yes rereading taking another look

36
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,459
and just

37
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,318
letting it play out

38
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
the first read and then coming back

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
again and again and seeing more each

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
time

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,500
um and a lot of the formalisms are not

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,599
in chapter one so

43
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,580
there is meat slash nutrition elsewhere

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,220
but also there's interesting insights

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,900
within the chapter and I'm sure it

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,480
sparked people to think about

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,120
um different things so anyone else feel

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,280
free to go for it like just

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,680
any sections of chapter one or any

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,680
framings that you remembered or you

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,680
highlighted or that stuck out to you

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,680
soon

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,640
Luigi oh thank you

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,160
foreign

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,420
motivates or excites people about

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,559
learning active

57
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,379
um

58
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,500
they situate the question that active

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,140
seeks to address as how do living

60
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,720
organisms persist while engaging in

61
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,220
adaptive exchanges with their

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,700
environment

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
pretty interesting

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,340
[Music]

65
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,120
um

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,800
is that the question that people thought

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,420
active inference

68
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,580
was going to seek to address

69
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,620
do they think active

70
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,019
May address another question as well

71
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,000
okay

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
as always just like feel free to raise

73
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,540
your hand or write something in the chat

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,459
or we'll just keep

75
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,959
exploring along

76
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,239
so I've not come across the neat

77
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,459
scruffy's dichotomy so that was a nice

78
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,319
perspective let's look at that

79
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,180
does anybody want to

80
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,840
um

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,480
summarize the needs and scruffies

82
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,040
or give like what did they think need

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,040
scruffy's means

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,820
or what was it doing at this part of the

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,300
book

86
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,040
and I I think uh my my take on it

87
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,800
um as a so I'm a physicist originally

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm so looking at it from sort of

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,060
building from the ground up

90
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,580
um you know creating unified theories of

91
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,900
things where everything is explainable

92
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,020
within some framework versus those who

93
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,060
try to look at the details and build

94
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,520
from the details up to to understand the

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
phenomena that was kind of my my

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,799
perspective on this

97
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,340
all right Ollie and then anyone else

98
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,580
yeah well actually I recommend this

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,440
um essay each time because I really like

100
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,639
it

101
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,720
um for um in the book Andy Clark and his

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,479
critics uh there's a beautiful essay by

103
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,699
Carl Preston mainly beyond the desert

104
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,460
landscape in which he explains in a very

105
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,940
beautiful prose the difference between

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,300
uh low road and the high road and it

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,680
goes into much further details about the

108
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,620
significance of these two approaches and

109
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,360
the pros and cons of conservich and also

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,940
the importance of

111
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,960
looking at the same the same phenomena

112
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,960
uh call it intelligence sentience or

113
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,360
agency or whatever from these two

114
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,539
perspectives and what can we glean from

115
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,240
looking at it from uh those to

116
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,000
perspectives so I highly recommend uh

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,940
reading this essay which you can find a

118
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,479
PDF for the for that essay on resources

119
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,699
page as well

120
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,919
thanks

121
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,639
thank you

122
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,099
foreign

123
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,639
neat

124
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,280
unified imperatives

125
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,860
scale-free systems

126
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,699
low road gets scruffy there's a lot of

127
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,280
last miles in the low road because every

128
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,259
generative model

129
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,300
is different

130
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,539
and they're complementary roads

131
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,500
to meet in the middle with octave Kate

132
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,080
or anyone else

133
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,960
um this is still pertaining to the

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,840
scruffies and needs I was just it just

135
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,360
occurred to me as I was both reading the

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
um introduction and now listening to

137
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,360
this how many of us here would be

138
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,580
self-described needs and self-described

139
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,580
scruffies I'm personally a definitely a

140
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,100
need I'm very much gravitating towards

141
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,039
an underlying common explanation for

142
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,840
everything so which draws me to the

143
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
active inference as such so I'm just

144
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,639
wondering in the group of us

145
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,199
where would we fall in that

146
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,340
curious awesome

147
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,800
very fun question yeah does anybody want

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,639
to

149
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,180
um

150
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,000
dox themselves in terms of being a knee

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,180
or a scruffy or some secret third thing

152
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,160
and just share like why that resonates

153
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,240
with them

154
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,020
and how they might see learning active

155
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,300
bolstering how they are

156
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,099
or providing some other

157
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
support

158
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,660
blue and then anyone else

159
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,300
so definitely a scruffy

160
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,400
um and uh you know like I mean I strive

161
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
towards neat right because I realize

162
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,120
that like order is is

163
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,880
um sometimes preferable I'm drawn to

164
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,440
active inference because I really feel

165
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,000
like it's a kind of a creative lens with

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,120
which to view like everything so it's

167
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,340
just another like set of rose-colored

168
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
glasses that I put on

169
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,120
um and like I also paint and do other

170
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
things and so sometimes like I'll be

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,419
staring at a person like I wonder how I

172
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,039
would represent their nose in charcoal

173
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,620
likes it so it just it's like one of

174
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,240
those things it's just a pair of glasses

175
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,700
that I um put on but I do want to also

176
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,279
draw the connection between

177
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,839
um what we were talking about yesterday

178
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,140
on the book stream so I don't know who's

179
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,279
watching that but um we had like you

180
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,420
know they're talking about leadership

181
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,620
styles

182
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,740
and there's like the antagonistic neural

183
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,160
network perspective where there are two

184
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,740
um like opposing not opposing maybe

185
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,560
unifying neural networks one is called

186
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,959
the task positive Network and the other

187
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,560
is the default mode Network

188
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,720
um with the task positive Network being

189
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,700
very like oriented at getting things

190
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,899
done

191
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,360
um it struck me as like a more orderly

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,640
thing like maybe in in line with like

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,880
the needs and the direct or default mode

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,640
Network being more like people-centered

195
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,500
and creativity

196
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,200
um focused and like it's also like the

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,519
difference between like right and left

198
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,779
brain I mean we hear all these things

199
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,100
all the time right

200
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,180
um there's like The Logical versus

201
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,760
emotional and so so perhaps like

202
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,300
it's maybe not neat or scruffy but maybe

203
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,979
it's both right I don't know

204
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,620
thanks Ali and then anyone else

205
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,440
um I also think that this distinction

206
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,959
between needs and scruffies uh somehow

207
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,080
relates to uh reductionism versus

208
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,620
emergentism uh which is pretty hot to

209
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,980
date uh nowadays in the philosophy of

210
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,920
science so uh

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,160
well of course we know that science for

212
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,399
the most part was uh basically a

213
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,600
reductive Endeavor and most scientists

214
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,560
um by large are reductivists but

215
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,760
nowadays especially from the mid 90s and

216
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,540
the Advent of the complexity theories

217
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,839
and dynamical systems and so on uh

218
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,560
another Viewpoint called emergentism

219
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,800
is actually emerging no pun intended and

220
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,220
uh but there was always a debate between

221
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,700
which one can provide uh the most

222
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,680
insightful discussions uh in in each

223
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,980
particular situations that

224
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,579
nowadays some philosophers uh kind of

225
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,360
take the middle ground between those two

226
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,220
uh such as the contextual emergentism uh

227
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,620
which has been described in this recent

228
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,980
book emergence in context

229
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,260
and I think active inference kind of

230
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,100
maps in my view perfectly to this point

231
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,959
of view of contextual emergentism and

232
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,540
it's the best of Two Worlds in some

233
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,959
sense it's purely reductive

234
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,079
Viewpoint and in another sense uh it's

235
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,180
it can be described as an emergent as

236
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,480
Viewpoint at least the branch of

237
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,820
emergentism called weak emergentism

238
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,000
great a lot of

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,360
threads there and fun comments in the

240
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,459
chat so Maria I failed to see how one

241
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,959
can work with details without some

242
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,640
theory behind is it possible with active

243
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,260
just

244
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,820
anyone give a thought

245
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,700
um but I totally agree

246
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,620
implicitly

247
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,260
always and explicitly often we do need

248
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,640
some sort of

249
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,040
combination

250
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,079
and also it kind of maps just like even

251
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,399
a little bit more Loosely like

252
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,760
industrial versus farmers market or

253
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,380
Boutique

254
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,200
and I think in the book

255
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,700
um

256
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,519
they uh basically say like

257
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,660
right before the needs and scruffies

258
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,860
okay

259
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,139
here's the two perspectives

260
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,839
one perspective is that

261
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,899
just the incredible diversity of Bio

262
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,139
biological systems and neural processes

263
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,079
each require a dedicated explanation so

264
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,899
we're going to have a journal or a

265
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,240
theory or an acronym or an undergraduate

266
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,100
major for just serotonergic synapses

267
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,459
that's one option every single phenomena

268
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,440
is going to have its own farmer's market

269
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,820
bespoke scruffy Theory

270
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,920
that would lead to the proliferation of

271
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,839
fields with little hope

272
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,940
for unification

273
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,060
the neat perspective

274
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,839
is recognizing diverse manifestations

275
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,720
but asking whether those

276
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,660
phenomena of broadly perception

277
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,060
cognition and action

278
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,160
from a lens of persistence and

279
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,339
adaptation in life

280
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,560
whether there might be some coherent

281
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,060
explanations

282
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,360
that again recognize the diversity of

283
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,639
manifestations and then help us

284
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,839
understand it

285
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,260
Michael and then Jonathan

286
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,860
foreign

287
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,200
I can't see

288
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,820
Michael or Jonathan

289
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,979
um

290
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,139
go ahead Jonathan I'll follow

291
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,700
um just to say that perhaps this sort of

292
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,440
dichotomy between

293
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,839
um a high road and a low road is kind of

294
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,100
a matter of perspective in the sense

295
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,860
that active inference itself

296
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,680
um you know it's it's it's a description

297
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,839
of certain types of systems but there

298
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,760
are other types of systems out there and

299
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,740
so if one wants to look at a higher

300
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,199
level view then in some sense you know

301
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,459
active inference and the free energy

302
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,920
principle are themselves the low road of

303
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,079
some higher level principle

304
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,459
um higher level physics principle

305
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,359
whatever it is you want

306
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,779
very interesting roads all the way up

307
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,160
slash down

308
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,920
uh Michael

309
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,320
yes in this conversation I may be saying

310
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,420
that I thought whatever was neat and

311
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,480
maybe I'm a scruffy uh the uh I want to

312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,100
jump back for just a second to what is

313
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,980
the key question instead of um I I was

314
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,779
troubled by that particular phrasing and

315
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,880
I I was like what what would I have

316
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,760
possibly said and I'll put in the chat

317
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,100
but for me the question is how does life

318
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,620
interrogate life

319
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,100
um uh it it there's this stance between

320
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,459
poetry and plumbing and that um there's

321
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,959
a lot of this conversation that is a

322
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,300
plumbing conversation and a part of the

323
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,699
way Consciousness

324
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:45,839
uh makes sense and speaks is poetry and

325
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,579
um and that that's one of the things

326
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,560
that um that is is the dance here of not

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,199
not an either or which is a plumbing way

328
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,139
of describing something but

329
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,699
um uh opposites and paradoxes uh that

330
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,399
are both um

331
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,380
simultaneously considered and that

332
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,980
um that Consciousness supports

333
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,040
um an active inference supports a way of

334
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,360
both

335
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
um problem solving and contemplating

336
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,699
mystery both concurrently and that this

337
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,180
is part of the kind of uh

338
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,880
there's something about not just the

339
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,220
problem solving but the the the the the

340
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,100
being related in a way that is not um

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,220
agentic if you will that I think is is

342
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,519
missing and and and some of this

343
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
thank you and that that really ties in

344
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,259
well with what blue brought up like the

345
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,360
task positive network is like the

346
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,000
getting things done and the default mode

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
is like the Mind wandering and the

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,459
receptivity and there's just an

349
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,740
oscillation between those two modes in

350
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,199
neural systems

351
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,859
Nathan welcome and yes please anything

352
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,959
you want to add

353
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,959
um yeah so I mean you're talking about

354
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,380
plumbing and poetry and you just we're

355
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,540
talking about tpn DM where we're

356
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,459
switching between these two modes of

357
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,480
thinking

358
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,199
um

359
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,140
and before that we're

360
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,199
talking about like higher and lower

361
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,299
levels of you know thinking about this

362
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,400
whole problem so are we making the claim

363
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,660
that like active inference is like are

364
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,700
are we making the claim that this is

365
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,620
like the appropriate layer of

366
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,299
abstraction to look at this problem

367
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,660
because when we usually look at big

368
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,360
problems like this we have to pick a

369
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,780
layer of abstraction where we're not

370
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,580
losing like a lot of detail and

371
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,880
resolution but um by going higher up in

372
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,799
abstraction but obviously we don't want

373
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,220
to get bogged down by the complexity of

374
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,200
adding more detail and resolution

375
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,280
very interesting question

376
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,299
I guess just one very logistical way to

377
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,480
address it is we're reading chapter one

378
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,260
that's giving us an overview of the book

379
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,480
then we're going to have like a month

380
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,780
to talk about the low road to active

381
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,419
inference and the high road to active

382
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,020
inference and that's gonna bring us

383
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,980
to active inference itself so at least

384
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,660
rhetorically

385
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,580
or pedagogically

386
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,640
in terms of how to lay out an argument

387
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,299
and or layout an educational approach it

388
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,799
seems like the authors do believe that

389
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,820
thinking about neats and scruffies

390
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,520
and the resolution

391
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,720
or the the unification of them

392
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,940
not through homogenization but by

393
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,760
recognizing those two perspectives that

394
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,780
that is an important construct

395
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,960
in at the very least understanding and

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,000
or learning active

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
and then

398
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,400
maybe that will bring us to the question

399
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,840
of whether it's also the appropriate

400
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
level of abstraction

401
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,460
in application

402
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,960
Ali and then anyone else

403
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,179
uh actually I don't think we can

404
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,220
associate a single level of abstraction

405
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,600
to active inference framework because uh

406
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,299
as far as I understand it active

407
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,520
imprints can equally be applied to

408
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,600
multiple levels of abstractions and it's

409
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,500
somehow uh

410
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,460
non- it's the scale free framework or in

411
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,500
other words where multiple scale

412
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,240
Frameworks so even

413
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,760
if we if we talk about temporal scales

414
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,500
or even spatial scales we can apply it

415
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,900
onto various

416
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,400
various scales and various levels of

417
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,919
abstractions so uh yeah it's not it's a

418
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,539
much more broader framework than we can

419
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,320
associate with some other theories which

420
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,919
specifically are a little limited to a

421
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,440
particular level of abstraction so

422
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,179
that might

423
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,640
we can see some of the examples for

424
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,799
these different levels of abstractions

425
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
especially in the second part of the

426
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,900
book

427
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,240
awesome thanks

428
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,039
so

429
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,000
um

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,100
let us turn to

431
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,220
some of the questions that people

432
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,440
prepared so does anyone see a question

433
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,760
that they

434
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,120
wrote that they would like to ask and we

435
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,260
can explore

436
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,140
or we'll go with the ones that people

437
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,220
have upvoted

438
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,140
but if anybody has like one that they

439
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,120
wrote or just want to highlight let's go

440
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,418
to it

441
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,059
and also it's awesome like I saw a lot

442
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,880
of people adding comments on the

443
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,919
questions

444
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,039
um

445
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
all right

446
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,059
let's just go to the most uploaded one

447
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,240
then

448
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,100
bring the question down into here so

449
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,939
it's just a little more visible

450
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,820
okay on page six it refers to active

451
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,220
inference as a normative framework there

452
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,480
are some evaluative standard against

453
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,520
which behavior can be scored which is

454
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,260
free energy

455
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,659
specifically the minimization of

456
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,520
variational version thereof so just to

457
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,860
plant the seed but we're gonna come back

458
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,120
to it later

459
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,720
the two kinds of free energy that we're

460
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,159
going to be talking a lot about are

461
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,620
variational and expected but we're going

462
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,059
to come back to that but for now let's

463
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,280
just think about free energy

464
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
as a unified imperative for perception

465
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,140
cognition and action

466
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,140
variational is in the present

467
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,559
and expected has to do with futures

468
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,539
then it refers to planning to achieve

469
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,000
distal goals in humans

470
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,580
does this definition of normative mean

471
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,640
that octave is agnostic about precisely

472
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,960
what humans goal that might be

473
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,940
one human may wish to save the world

474
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,039
another may wish to rule the world both

475
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,860
are essentially minimizing free energy

476
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,840
I might be mixing up a few Concepts here

477
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,059
but the gift is that active models don't

478
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,799
predict a socially normative course of

479
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,080
action would that be correct to say

480
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,220
all right

481
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,900
what would anybody like to add on

482
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,940
normativity

483
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,400
of active

484
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,679
what does it mean to say that active is

485
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,140
a normative framework

486
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,799
does that refer to social norms or what

487
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,500
kind of normativity is being described

488
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,400
Ali go for it

489
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,980
I guess at the most fundamental level uh

490
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,760
the normativity admits the agent uh to

491
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,520
be persist through time uh so uh one

492
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,640
meaning of normativity can be uh seen

493
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,299
from the most fundamental requirement of

494
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,620
a system or quote-unquote thing to

495
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,960
actually exist or persist through time

496
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,039
but of course we can apply this concept

497
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,880
onto some higher levels of conceptions

498
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,520
such as social normativity and so on but

499
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,780
yeah again it applies to multiple levels

500
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,460
of abstraction

501
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,120
thank you Jonathan

502
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,340
yeah that that sort of requirement for

503
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,320
wanting to persist Through Time feels

504
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,620
like an an evolutionary imperative and

505
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,360
there are other imperatives into in

506
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,799
terms of our sort of homeostatic set

507
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,900
points and comfort and and hunger and

508
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,539
things like that which then lead to

509
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,559
um the thing which has been

510
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,600
evolutionarily

511
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,140
um uh sort of chosen through time so it

512
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,000
feels like the two kind of have a

513
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,980
um there's a balance between the two in

514
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,620
in terms of hierarchies of scales of

515
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,100
time I guess

516
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,000
thank you

517
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,280
thank you Scott for bringing in that

518
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,120
quote

519
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,799
so I I often compare active with linear

520
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,200
regression

521
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,020
because they're both modeling Frameworks

522
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,320
that are quantitative and so sometimes

523
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,700
it helps to be like okay is this

524
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,640
statement true of linear regression

525
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,260
and there's things that are true for

526
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,779
both octave and linear regression those

527
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,120
like are just true of modeling or

528
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,100
quantitative models and then there's

529
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
things that are different between active

530
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,480
and linear regression those are like the

531
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,279
features that differentiate octave and

532
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,760
linear regression so we might say that a

533
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,440
linear regression

534
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,799
is normatively using this kind of

535
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,419
imperative function

536
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,360
like to fit the least squares or the L2

537
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,559
Norm

538
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,380
and it's just saying this framework is

539
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,140
going to use this imperative

540
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,140
to draw a straight line through points

541
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,600
and kind of by analogy

542
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,880
act INF is going to use an imperative

543
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,000
turns out it's a free energy functional

544
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,500
that we're going to go into in the

545
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,059
coming chapters

546
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,419
it uses that unified imperative

547
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,159
not to draw a straight line through

548
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,919
points like a linear regression does

549
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,179
but to describe Bayes optimal perception

550
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,500
cognition and action

551
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,140
so it's doing something similar

552
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,120
instead of having like one imperative

553
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,039
for perception and then a different

554
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,840
imperative for action

555
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,000
it's a unified model

556
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,179
of perception cognition and action

557
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,840
that we can use this one imperative

558
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,340
the free energy of a generative model

559
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,700
and use that to guide

560
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,000
the fine-tuning or the learning of that

561
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,720
generative model

562
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,120
to return to the social question as we

563
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,520
move forward

564
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,120
no it is not like uh

565
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,799
an ought

566
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,900
it's not the is odd this is not an

567
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,299
ethical framework

568
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,279
just because there's a normative way to

569
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,740
fit a linear regression doesn't mean

570
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,779
that

571
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,960
it tells you what any given culture

572
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
is going to be happy or upset or benefit

573
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,179
from or anything like that

574
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,500
there's probably a lot there's other

575
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,880
ways to say it but just the short answer

576
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,380
is

577
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,659
this is correct

578
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,100
octave is not in the kernel of active

579
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,659
is not describing social normativity in

580
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,520
the sense of like peer pressure or like

581
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,200
what people will look at you weirdly if

582
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,500
you do

583
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,820
okay

584
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,200
next question

585
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,659
living organisms can only maintain their

586
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,460
bodily Integrity by exerting adaptive

587
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,460
control over the action perception Loop

588
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,320
which they frame that adaptive control

589
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,000
as the question that active seeks to

590
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,100
address

591
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,279
do generative models represent and

592
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,840
thereby predict bodily integrity

593
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,020
or do these models predict the causes of

594
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,140
their sensory inputs

595
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,480
and Via minimizing the prediction error

596
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,580
they achieve maintaining their bodily

597
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,520
Integrity without explicitly predicting

598
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,980
bodily integrity

599
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,320
how to best talk about what a generative

600
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
model is predicting

601
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,299
great questions what does anyone want to

602
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,480
add

603
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,600
well I think one short answer and then

604
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,340
Ali is that generative models fit

605
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,100
whatever parameters they have

606
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,880
so you could imagine making a generative

607
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,020
model

608
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,140
where there's like a hidden state that

609
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,000
is bodily integrity

610
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,260
and then

611
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,299
there's observations that help reduce

612
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,299
uncertainty about bodily

613
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,620
um integrity

614
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,419
so in that case we'd say yes the

615
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,159
generative model represents bodily

616
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,640
Integrity as a hidden state

617
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,600
and therefore tries to

618
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,380
do inference using that

619
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,480
or do these models predict the causes of

620
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,820
their sensory input and Via minimizing

621
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,960
prediction error they achieve

622
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,340
maintaining their bodily integrity

623
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,159
that's actually like another way to say

624
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,779
something similar

625
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,500
which is that the hidden states are the

626
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,820
latent causes of sensory observations

627
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,460
and so by minimizing the prediction

628
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,600
error

629
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,399
with respect to observations

630
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,799
it is possible to achieve maintenance or

631
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,760
homeostasis of those latent States

632
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,159
even though they are not they are

633
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,799
explicitly predicted or represented but

634
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,179
they're not observed

635
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,440
Ali anyone else

636
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,679
uh well actually an acts of inference uh

637
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,399
all the agents or more technically all

638
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,360
all the particular systems and all the

639
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,640
particles sorry uh do are kind of doing

640
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,820
the this kind of inference making tasks

641
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,299
in order to

642
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:23,779
self-evidence and actually this task of

643
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:27,600
self-evidencing is the fundamental uh

644
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,260
task that an agent needs to undertake in

645
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,539
order to uh

646
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:39,380
keep its homeostasis into action or uh

647
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,539
doing uh that kind of homeostasis

648
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,840
through allostasis because both of those

649
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,059
terms are obviously related one of which

650
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:51,840
needs a more active

651
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,120
um and more and more active

652
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,039
mediation to to undertake the the

653
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,360
homeostasis test but in any case uh the

654
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,179
the concept of self-evancing exactly

655
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,620
refers to this kind of uh Integrity

656
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,940
maintaining uh

657
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,659
task that any

658
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:20,100
self any inference making agent needs to

659
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,419
undertake to persist through time so I

660
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:25,980
think this is the fundamental

661
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,220
requirement of any agents modeled in

662
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,500
active inference framework

663
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,360
awesome thank you

664
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,039
and once we start into the subsequent

665
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,299
chapters and we look at how preference

666
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,760
is used in active inference we'll have

667
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,640
some awesome discussions like

668
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,460
do we expect

669
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,899
homeostatic temperatures or do we prefer

670
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,480
them it's like on one hand I prefer it's

671
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,799
what I like

672
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,659
on the other hand it's what I expect

673
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,940
because I wouldn't be surprised to find

674
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,659
myself there so how does that play out

675
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,960
um ever

676
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:10,080
yes and you hear me okay

677
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,340
okay so a good good answer also depends

678
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,159
on which level of the hierarchy you are

679
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:18,659
talking

680
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,140
um so at the lowest of hierarchy there's

681
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,480
sensory

682
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,760
stimuli that's are being predicted and

683
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,019
the more you move up the more abstract

684
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:33,140
models or predictions are taking place

685
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,919
so higher up the hierarchy I could have

686
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,580
predictions about bodily Integrity

687
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,039
or predictions about my continuing

688
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,200
existence

689
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,539
Etc and then lower down the hierarchy

690
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,519
you could have some physiological

691
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,260
variable that's predicted like

692
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,200
nociception in the case of pain

693
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,820
and then you can have all

694
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,840
awesome

695
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,320
okay was that is that all

696
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,560
yes okay okay yes totally agree

697
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,520
um

698
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,619
often people talk about like nested

699
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,719
models or hierarchical models

700
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,020
multi-scale models and that's one of the

701
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,440
strengths of taking of at least bringing

702
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,760
some neatness into play is like

703
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,679
by using

704
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,500
a level of neatness that lets us

705
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
generalize across different cognitive

706
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,780
phenomena like what we might just

707
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,760
conversationally call low level or high

708
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,139
level

709
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,980
it allows those models to be composed in

710
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,418
an integrated way

711
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,739
so

712
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,440
in this textbook there's not going to be

713
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,679
an emphasis on nested modeling it's

714
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,379
going to focus on like the kernel of

715
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,320
active inference which is like the

716
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,880
single agent at the single level

717
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,380
but then there's all of these

718
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,280
elaborations which are active areas of

719
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,560
research and development

720
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,380
um outside of the textbook yes thank you

721
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,740
Yana

722
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,359
could you clarify low and high level

723
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,320
yeah

724
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,920
I think that they uh if I think about

725
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,200
the cortical

726
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,280
hierarchy there's I think six layers

727
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,820
uh

728
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,160
um and and if I read the literature

729
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,079
correctly they talk about

730
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,720
different kind of predictions depending

731
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,960
on which kind of cortical area you are

732
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,740
talking about

733
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,579
and and the active inference models are

734
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:54,839
built

735
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:59,359
in a way that's go that's also uh fits

736
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,940
uh the anatomy of the brain so they talk

737
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,380
about computational Anatomy fitting the

738
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,400
active inference models

739
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,800
thank you Jonathan and then John Luigi

740
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,599
um yeah I think that that's right I

741
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,820
think another perspective is is simply

742
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,180
that low level is for instance the the

743
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,700
pure sensory inputs themselves

744
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,260
um we may be making predictions about

745
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,900
you know a site that um something that

746
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,060
will come to our eyes higher level might

747
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,260
be some

748
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,200
um sort of more abstract idea of the

749
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,700
thing that it is outside in the world

750
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,040
that is is giving us the sensory input

751
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,980
and so there's a sort of hierarchy of

752
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,220
um time scales and physical scales

753
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,079
um that we might take in moment to

754
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,640
moment and build up a bigger and bigger

755
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,740
picture

756
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,680
awesome so just to restate that at the

757
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,960
engine Luigi the low level this is just

758
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,180
one spatial metaphor

759
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,460
is that the pure sensory inputs

760
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,020
themselves like the low level is where

761
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,940
the rubber hits the road

762
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,220
and then the higher levels

763
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,960
are abstract or synthesized

764
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,700
representations about what are giving

765
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,240
rise to those sensory data and that is

766
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,940
also called a cause in the statistical

767
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,260
sense

768
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,000
Luigi

769
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,560
than ever

770
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,880
yeah

771
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,599
um I also believe that it really depends

772
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,140
on how your generative model is set up I

773
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,579
mean a high level

774
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,460
can also be a pretty straightforward

775
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,119
sensory uh inference so to say between

776
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,880
one observation and one hidden State and

777
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,240
not something absolutely abstract or at

778
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,820
least that's what I saw like I I agree

779
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,280
that plastically it has been like those

780
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,400
cortical layers or the the lower levels

781
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,440
are the most most

782
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,060
um low level sensory uh inputs so so to

783
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,400
say and the higher levels are the more

784
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
abstract ones but I do believe that they

785
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,880
also uh that the distinction might also

786
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,440
not be that strict

787
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,680
all right and then effort

788
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,859
then there's a few more points to make

789
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:23,760
yeah and this question uh about what is

790
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,060
predicted also uh

791
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,240
um I think it also has to be seen from

792
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,820
this uh instrumentalist and realist

793
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,000
discussion uh is it is it the modeler

794
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,359
that uh is building an active inference

795
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,420
model and tries to infer what the

796
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,440
organism at whatever level is predicting

797
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,900
uh and and that's what I wonder is um

798
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,480
you you also read in the literature A

799
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,640
lot of times that they talk

800
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,119
um with the terms as if it looks as if

801
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,180
the organism is minimizing this or that

802
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,300
or predicting this or that so this s if

803
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,980
language

804
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,820
um

805
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,640
also makes me wonder how how do we know

806
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,880
what an organism is predicting

807
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,640
awesome this instrumentalist and realist

808
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,220
and map territory we're going to return

809
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,140
to a lot

810
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,180
um on I want to bring a few more points

811
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,320
on the nested models and then we'll

812
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,240
return to the questions since

813
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,220
um like nested modeling it's kind of

814
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,300
like

815
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,480
the active kernel is like one Lego brick

816
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,880
with like a bottom and a top part and

817
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,980
then like it is very amenable and as

818
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,300
soon as we have the Legos we want to

819
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,700
stack and put them in lateral and build

820
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,079
them

821
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,920
but the multi-level Lego structure is

822
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,500
predicated on what that one is at least

823
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,300
understanding what it is so

824
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,460
in live stream 28

825
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,180
on um sandved Smith's paper this is just

826
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,460
one example of a nested model with three

827
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,720
layers

828
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,800
where the quote low level is sensory

829
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,780
and then there's a level of attention

830
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,700
and meta awareness so there's not just

831
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,500
one way to do nested models there's many

832
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,660
nested models that one can make but it's

833
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,300
an example of how something that is like

834
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,119
raw and exteroceptive

835
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,839
can be seen as a low level model nested

836
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,579
Within

837
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,980
other models that are quote higher but

838
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,480
again that's just like a that's just

839
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,300
like a a cultural visual graphical

840
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,160
layout there's no reason why it couldn't

841
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,960
be from left to right or top to bottom

842
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,940
or inside to out so it's like it's about

843
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,280
what it is not just the spatial layout

844
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,680
but that's what it is

845
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,099
on the six levels of the brain so here's

846
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:47,040
from um live stream 43 which was with

847
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,660
Maria

848
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,920
um

849
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,140
yes there are six anatomical layers in

850
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,380
parts of the mammal brain

851
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,859
six layers that are defined like

852
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,180
histologically like the tissues look

853
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,440
different

854
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,760
but

855
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
it's really important to remember that

856
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,280
is not the same thing as it's not six

857
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,900
nested Legos

858
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,300
and we're gonna get to this more when we

859
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,359
get to chapter five which is all about

860
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,520
um the neuroscience

861
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,280
but here are those six layers

862
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,579
so this is not six full nested models

863
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,240
like here's three full nested models

864
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,640
that are truly nested whereas the six

865
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,980
histological layers

866
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,960
actually are part of an integrated

867
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,880
inference scheme

868
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,260
it's not six nested models

869
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,940
but a lot of times people think oh

870
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,760
multi-level models hierarchical Bayesian

871
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,700
modeling hierarchical predictive coding

872
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,560
architectures

873
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,079
six layers in the brain six nested

874
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,820
models that's not true

875
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,040
but that's a very common

876
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,760
um

877
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,420
framing

878
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,400
so what is the generative model

879
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,520
predicting whatever it is set up to

880
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,800
predict these are maps not territories

881
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,140
okay I think okay great

882
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,660
there were some some awesome discourse

883
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,500
here

884
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,780
so can someone explain to me

885
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,760
why the inferential problem is

886
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,700
intractable page eight it has to do with

887
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,500
the marginal likelihood P of Y in the

888
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,619
Bayes theorem so does anyone here

889
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,599
who is in this discussion like want to

890
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,040
summarize it

891
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,859
or what their understanding of what is

892
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,280
the tractability issue

893
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,320
and how are we going to approach that

894
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,020
um yes am I the the sort of example I

895
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,420
gave there was that if you see a flash

896
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,280
of light you want to know what's the

897
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,440
probability that it is a particular

898
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,079
thing given that you have you've you've

899
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,240
had some observation of the world

900
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,280
um but in order to do that you need to

901
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,599
sum up

902
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,060
um in this case all of the different

903
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,099
things that could have given rise to

904
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,260
that particular flash of lights and that

905
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,480
in itself is in is intractable so there

906
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,640
are various terms within the

907
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,700
um within the base equation which in

908
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,560
order to do it properly in a complex

909
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,660
world would mean summing over an

910
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,700
infinite number of things that was my my

911
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,800
thought there

912
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,420
great

913
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,900
great

914
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,140
so

915
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,420
there's a lot of ways to to talk about

916
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,500
this

917
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,200
but you pointed to that that several

918
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,220
pieces are required to go from a stimuli

919
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,819
to inference about a causal state of the

920
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,500
world like whether it was truly a tiger

921
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,180
giving rise to the stimuli or whether

922
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,280
it's something different

923
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,319
you'd want to know a few things you'd

924
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,859
want to know the probability of given

925
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,900
that it's a tiger what is the

926
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,880
probability it would look like that

927
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,740
flash you saw

928
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,680
but then also you want to know

929
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,339
How likely is that flash from other

930
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,819
possible hidden causes

931
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,339
and so that is like the probability of

932
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,200
The Flash given that it's a tiger or

933
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,540
given as a chipmunk given it's all these

934
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,859
other things

935
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:29,160
and that can be an open-ended

936
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,759
some

937
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,740
so thanks for that great answer it is in

938
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,359
essence an infinite sum of possible

939
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,040
things

940
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,700
and you'd have to know the probability

941
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,060
to be able to say

942
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,380
what you should really think

943
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,780
there's there's there's many notes like

944
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,900
yeah ever you go for it

945
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,900
no

946
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,500
um I also found in the book that they

947
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,680
say for complex models there maybe

948
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,319
many types of hidden states that all

949
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,020
need marginalizing out making the

950
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,880
problem computationally interactable so

951
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,460
I thought you were saying that before

952
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,660
but I also found that the a sentence the

953
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,540
marginal marginalization operation might

954
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,200
require analytically intractable

955
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,680
integrals and I I don't understand what

956
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,060
that means

957
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,520
is it different than the answer you gave

958
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,759
before

959
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,339
it's it's very related so sometimes um

960
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:46,440
in a discrete

961
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,760
setting

962
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,359
we are talking about sums like sums you

963
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,339
know one two three four five sum over

964
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:56,280
one two three four five in a continuous

965
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,780
setting

966
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,900
we are talking about integrals

967
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,560
so if something is being summed over a

968
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,819
discrete range

969
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,460
that is analogous to it having an

970
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,160
integral over a continuous range and so

971
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,900
they're both beset with the same

972
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,720
challenges of large

973
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,060
um and interacting spaces

974
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,579
and then just one kind of note because

975
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,280
on a Bayesian and marginalization this

976
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,619
is like actually the margins of a piece

977
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,819
of paper

978
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,319
that's what it's referring to when

979
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,540
there's kind of like Actuarial tables

980
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,940
back when statistics was done on

981
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,260
spreadsheets

982
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,540
so it's like if you have states of the

983
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,680
world and then observations in in a grid

984
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,839
um if each observation mapped onto one

985
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,339
hidden state of the world

986
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,619
then you would just have like only on

987
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:49,859
the diagonal would you have any numbers

988
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,440
we're going to come back to these topics

989
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,960
but then you can imagine that you might

990
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,140
be interested in marginalizing a given

991
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,400
row

992
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,240
like summing across that row

993
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,780
so saying okay How likely is this across

994
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,819
all columns and that's called

995
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,599
marginalization

996
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:16,980
so why is it intractable

997
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,980
because it might just be requiring

998
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,839
computational resources that are

999
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,520
unrealistic or implausible

1000
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,940
okay I think uh it's there was actually

1001
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,160
the the reason the whole reason for a

1002
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,160
variational free energy a quantity uh

1003
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,839
this this marginal likelihood thing

1004
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,040
is that correct

1005
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,660
yes it is it is free energy

1006
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,800
is going to help bound

1007
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,020
our surprise

1008
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,560
let's but let's come right to it

1009
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,220
so this one kind of goes in multiple

1010
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,220
different uh directions

1011
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,200
the central imperative is that organisms

1012
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,660
maintain their existence High Road avoid

1013
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,180
surprising States

1014
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,800
how can one explain different self-harms

1015
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,660
or perceived self-harms

1016
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,119
this is kind of like the social norms

1017
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,980
question

1018
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,599
in that

1019
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,300
um we're not always going to get a neat

1020
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,680
answer from a human scale complex nested

1021
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,980
system where the generative model hasn't

1022
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,660
been stated

1023
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,460
this if that makes sense so like given a

1024
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,079
generative model

1025
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,640
one could describe how driving off a

1026
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,760
cliff is the mo that is the generative

1027
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,280
models most likely course of action like

1028
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,319
if the generative model is I always

1029
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,119
drive straight I'm likely to find myself

1030
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,560
driving straight

1031
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,020
that generative model may drive off a

1032
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,160
cliff

1033
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,859
but to kind of not mention the

1034
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:10,020
generative model and just say well how

1035
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,720
is it possible that surprise is bounded

1036
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,880
by driving off cliffs

1037
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,560
is not

1038
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,300
a full

1039
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,500
um

1040
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,619
it's not fully making contact with what

1041
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,579
the surprise is because surprise is with

1042
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:29,280
respect to a generative model

1043
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,560
so whether it's the extremely complex

1044
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,880
cases of humans

1045
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,400
or whether we're talking about something

1046
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,839
different

1047
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,740
then surprise and the bounding of

1048
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,260
surprise through free energy

1049
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,160
is with respect to a generative model

1050
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,700
everything is always in respect

1051
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,920
to generative model

1052
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,260
there's no surprise minimization free

1053
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,940
energy minimization outside of a

1054
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,920
generative model

1055
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,440
so surprise immunization free energy

1056
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,900
minimization those

1057
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,400
are

1058
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,500
qualities of a generative model just

1059
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,220
like the um least squares regression the

1060
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,859
sum of squares is with respect to a

1061
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,359
linear regression model

1062
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,760
surprise bounding free energy is with

1063
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,619
respect to an active inference

1064
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,660
generative model and once the generative

1065
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,940
model is specified

1066
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,380
then one may find different actions

1067
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,500
as avoiding surprising States including

1068
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,240
addiction and different states that

1069
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,500
people have studied that we're going to

1070
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,520
come to

1071
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,700
but we need to fill out what generative

1072
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,119
model we're talking about before

1073
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,339
applying the imperative Jonathan and

1074
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,260
then Everett

1075
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,240
you know within that generative model

1076
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,920
there are also

1077
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,660
um the the different desired states that

1078
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,579
the organism might want to be in and

1079
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,800
those desired States you know they're

1080
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,200
they're not normative in the sort of

1081
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,180
sociological sense we may have different

1082
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,660
desired States and so for some some

1083
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,760
people that may be very different from

1084
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,260
what another person wants and may lead

1085
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,760
to one of these outcomes

1086
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,480
thank you and ever

1087
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,559
yes it's uh this uh example with the

1088
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:24,140
suicide

1089
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,260
it's also related to the high roads

1090
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,059
where the imperative is to um

1091
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:36,059
maintain our existence minimizing uh

1092
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:40,460
surprise necessary for survival

1093
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,740
um so if if I commit suicide and I would

1094
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,079
violate that core imperative and but we

1095
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,359
do know that people commit suicide so

1096
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,280
how can we explain that so this

1097
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,819
framework

1098
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
um and it also has to do with um if I

1099
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,220
predict bodily Integrity

1100
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,359
um but for example I uh someone who

1101
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:09,000
experiences chronic pain because that's

1102
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,180
the best explanation for my prediction

1103
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,640
error that I have

1104
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,940
will be an update of the model that says

1105
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,980
okay now I'm not predicting any bodily

1106
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,380
Integrity anymore but I have threats to

1107
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,800
my bodily integrity and with that also

1108
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,619
then lead to eventually committing

1109
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:32,040
suicide or just some some thoughts but I

1110
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,099
can't make really sense of this

1111
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,260
um thanks

1112
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,720
okay just in our final minutes to touch

1113
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,180
on one or two more all these discussions

1114
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,660
people can continue to engage and and

1115
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,660
develop ad resources ask more questions

1116
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,960
like it doesn't stop here this is like

1117
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,720
the tip of the iceberg of us wanting to

1118
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,520
develop the state on these questions

1119
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,780
because they're things that we're all

1120
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,099
asking they're things that other people

1121
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:01,680
are going to be curious about and we can

1122
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,119
have

1123
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,359
great answers

1124
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,180
and complex discourse and multiple

1125
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,119
perspectives here

1126
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,579
um we're just going to do one more and

1127
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,339
then we'll end two minutes before

1128
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,380
um the hour

1129
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,480
and again these are also things we're

1130
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,579
going to return to in future weeks this

1131
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,280
is just our first week on chapter one

1132
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,220
next week we're gonna do another chapter

1133
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,920
one session and we'll come through more

1134
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,480
questions the second half of the

1135
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,920
questions on chapter one and anything

1136
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,500
else that people add and upvote so just

1137
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,480
in the last three minutes

1138
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,599
can someone explain why exploration and

1139
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,520
exploitation are automatically balanced

1140
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,319
through policy selection in active

1141
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,359
inference page 10. what does it mean to

1142
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,940
say both exploration exploitation are

1143
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,420
balanced

1144
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,140
Jana thank you I will save this chat

1145
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,720
uh

1146
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,900
in my in my understanding it would be

1147
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,380
that you only explore as much as

1148
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,359
necessary to exploit

1149
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,540
so you want so X

1150
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,420
exploration is an effort

1151
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,000
somehow and you want to minimize this to

1152
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,880
get the maximum of exploitation

1153
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,260
that's my understanding approximately

1154
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,700
thanks

1155
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,960
um one uh very Hands-On

1156
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,300
uh

1157
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,400
way to explore this question is in model

1158
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,140
stream 7.2

1159
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,240
from just a few days ago

1160
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,460
in the video description of model stream

1161
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,920
72 there is

1162
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,220
[Music]

1163
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,220
um

1164
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,380
a notebook that can be run in your

1165
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,740
browser without any more tweaking

1166
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,300
and it is going to have an agent that

1167
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,500
has the choice to do a few different

1168
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,319
things they can play either of two

1169
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,540
different slot machines one of which is

1170
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,059
like better than the other or they can

1171
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:46,319
get a hint

1172
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,000
and so

1173
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,839
um

1174
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:51,780
to have an imbalanced strategy

1175
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,660
would be like to kind of Zone into the

1176
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,220
first slot machine you go to and stay

1177
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,540
there

1178
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,180
to have a overly imbalanced strategy

1179
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,240
towards um exploration that might look

1180
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,720
like just getting the hint every time or

1181
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,400
just kind of moving around really

1182
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,160
rapidly in the space but not ever like

1183
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,380
latching on to ones that have high

1184
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,359
utility

1185
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,940
and then a balance strategy

1186
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,920
which there's not just one single answer

1187
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,660
to this but a balanced strategy in a

1188
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,660
given situation is an action policy

1189
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,680
selection it's a strategy or tactics

1190
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,160
that navigate or manage the tensions of

1191
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,960
the requirements between exploration

1192
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,059
exploitation and sometimes that's

1193
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,500
modeled what's called a multi-armed

1194
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,000
bandit where there's like a bunch of

1195
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,040
slot machines you want to win the most

1196
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,559
money but you don't know how good each

1197
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,119
of the slot machines are so you got to

1198
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,040
explore a little bit to find out like

1199
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,079
how good they are but then you want to

1200
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,660
spend most of your time on the best ones

1201
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,520
you want to spend time proportional to

1202
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,440
how good they are but of course if you

1203
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,880
only spend time on what you perceive as

1204
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,740
the best things might be changing and so

1205
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,660
you might end up not being on the best

1206
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,579
machine soon so

1207
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,980
