1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,840
hello everyone thanks for joining or

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,960
listening it's November 11th

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,000
11 11 22.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,880
and we're in cohort two of the active

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,380
textbook group

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,139
having a discussion of chapter five

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
exploring some topics

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,100
there are some questions

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,720
that have been written in comments as

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,560
well

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,199
and then

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,340
taking it wherever we want as we review

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,140
the first half of the book

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,540
that'll be today

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,460
and then

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,660
next week we'll be taking an even

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,399
further step back

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,640
and more of a focus on like feedback

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,460
completing the feedback form

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,920
how can we improve and structure future

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,680
textbook group cohorts project ideas and

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,520
so on

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,440
but for today we're in chapter five

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,879
so

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,500
um

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,720
does anyone want to

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
give any thoughts or comments or just

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,299
initial questions to raise about chapter

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,659
five

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,619
all right then let's go into the written

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,100
questions

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,840
okay

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,880
how does the simple hierarchy with

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,860
one-to-one mapping between levels as

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,500
shown in the left hand side of figures 4

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,420
4

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,420
6.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,979
and 5.2

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,840
44

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,480
four six

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,760
five two

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,819
relate to actual brain hierarchies such

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,760
as the classic fellerman and Van Essen

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,179
diagram

45
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,280
from retinal ganglion cells up to

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,900
hippocampus with many to many mapping

47
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,420
between Regional units

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,018
ah

49
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,640
I guess this is the famous

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,420
diagram

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,340
well what do people think how do these

52
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,500
seemingly

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,000
skyscraper like

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,500
hierarchical models

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,239
this one is laid out side to side but we

56
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,459
can see ascending and descending so this

57
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,900
could have been graphically laid out

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,580
like this and then another one and then

59
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,319
a third one on top

60
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,000
of course top down the bottom-up are

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,860
just spatial metaphors

62
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,360
so

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,959
um

64
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,459
how do we reconcile

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,720
computational hierarchical models

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,360
with

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,379
the empirical structural connectivity of

68
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,180
the brain

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,099
which

70
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,700
has

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,940
a wiring structure

72
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,159
looking like this

73
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,000
Ali

74
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,739
between these two kinds of icons or

75
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,099
kinds of maps because on one hand we

76
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,699
have a kind of relational map and on the

77
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,579
other hand there is a kind of

78
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,139
architectural slash functional mapping

79
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,100
of the brain so

80
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,639
for example if we look at a circuit map

81
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,540
of the of an electric circuit there's we

82
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,180
have a relational map there right but

83
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,320
when we want to implement that circuit I

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
mean

85
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,419
in terms of wiring and so on we need to

86
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,139
have another kind of map which is

87
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,240
architectural one

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,100
so

89
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,680
of course in some cases there's a

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,620
possibility of translating one map

91
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,000
perfectly onto the other but there isn't

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,060
necessarily an isomorphism between those

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,160
two kinds of map and I think in this

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
case we don't necessarily see that

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
isomorphism here as well

96
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,660
excellent great answer totally agreed

97
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,380
these kinds of diagrams are often

98
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,120
described as hierarchical or heterotical

99
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,919
or people use difference

100
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,580
um

101
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,400
words to describe it but it's describing

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,740
the anatomical connectivity of different

103
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,840
brain regions

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,020
whereas the diagrams that are shown in

105
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,639
these figures that were mentioned in the

106
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,800
question

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,740
are not anatomical Regions they're

108
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,160
statistical variables connected by edges

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,539
this is the difference between

110
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,419
structural and effective and functional

111
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,240
connectivity structural connectivity is

112
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,660
what pieces are actually put together

113
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,680
and through direct contact

114
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,360
intermediating

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,860
whereas

116
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,440
functional connectivity has to do with

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
the statistical relationships in the

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,020
system

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,539
and those are not necessarily for a

120
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,759
given set of measurements or spatial or

121
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,039
temporal scale or experimental stimuli

122
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,220
those are not exactly the same thing

123
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,460
there are cases where there are but that

124
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,620
doesn't mean that in general they're the

125
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,319
same thing so how do they relate to

126
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,699
quote actual brain hierarchies

127
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,560
they relate to each other in the way

128
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,139
that Ali just described

129
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,240
similarly between

130
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,240
um uh architectural diagram and a

131
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,199
functional diagram

132
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,300
does anyone have any other

133
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,500
thoughts on this

134
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,840
yeah Giuseppe

135
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,240
yeah I think that is a is a very good

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,940
explanation on the other hand I think

137
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,660
that at that stage of the of the

138
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,699
description the idea was to see how

139
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,280
active inference could also provide a

140
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,599
process Theory so basically to to see

141
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,060
how these information mechanism may be

142
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,599
implemented in a neural circuits so

143
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,020
yes the two are not completely the two

144
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,139
descriptions are not isomorphic but I

145
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,500
think there should be some degree of

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,940
of uh agreement and

147
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,300
in this case I think that

148
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,500
what may be masking the the the

149
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,940
similarities or the the potential

150
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,220
overlap is that you know there there's a

151
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,080
a big difference in the degree of

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,660
complexity of the so one is a very

153
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,240
simple the the active inference diagram

154
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,860
is a very simple sketch of a very simple

155
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,880
micro circuit while this one is a big

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,099
architecture with a lot of complexity

157
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,199
and it's difficult to

158
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,400
to go in and say you know

159
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,479
to map exactly those kind of micro

160
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,780
circuits within this large circuit

161
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,919
scheme

162
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
it's probably the there's going to be

163
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,120
various

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,760
micro circuits in there with the various

165
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,919
degrees of a hierarchical structure

166
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,580
within that

167
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,240
that large scheme I guess

168
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
yeah

169
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,420
um all great points

170
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,660
the figures that were pointed to

171
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,000
reflect like just

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
simple

173
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,620
illustrative examples

174
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,959
whereas the whole brain

175
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,899
or many of the regions of the brain if

176
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,940
one were to even just describe this with

177
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,680
an active inference model it wouldn't

178
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,380
look as simple and narrow as these

179
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,700
previous figures so it's a different

180
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,820
type of diagram it's a different scale

181
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,519
yet

182
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,339
through Visual and prose-based

183
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,320
argumentation

184
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,019
as well as the the hopes and dreams of a

185
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,160
field

186
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,220
is that there is a relationship between

187
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,740
the messages that are passed between

188
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,200
different variables statistically which

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,240
as we discussed last time it can you

190
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,180
could arrange these in a hexagon

191
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,760
it wouldn't change the topology and thus

192
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
the function of the base graph

193
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,140
however it is being laid out in a

194
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,519
specific way

195
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,180
to demonstrate resonance with

196
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,880
given cellular populations in a cortical

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
column

198
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,380
so it's kind of

199
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
um

200
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,420
situational to what extent the

201
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,120
structural neuroanatomy

202
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,980
aligns with the Bayes graph as specified

203
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,300
but

204
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,040
we can definitely say that they're not

205
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
the same thing

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,519
that they don't have to be the same

207
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,899
thing

208
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,320
but there's also situations where by

209
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,420
graphical design

210
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,360
using that in multiple ways meaning you

211
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
could constrain your construction of the

212
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,320
base graph

213
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,560
such that it has some structural

214
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,860
patterns with the anatomy and then also

215
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,540
just in terms of like visual graphical

216
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,800
design

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
like you can just lay it out visually

218
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,079
because this is not these are it's not

219
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,120
exactly like there's five and then three

220
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,339
like there's other things that are here

221
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,200
that aren't shown here

222
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,500
so like this is a a course mapping

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,860
any other thoughts on this question

224
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,399
asked

225
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,079
uh just really briefly I feel like the

226
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,779
30 million foot view of the like

227
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,480
structural constraints sort of is that

228
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
in the general case of a base graph your

229
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,820
well inactive inference we're talking

230
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
about like a Markov chain or some

231
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,399
blanket that is kind of ultimately the

232
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,040
state space kind of which is included in

233
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
it

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,120
um

235
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,480
if you're trying to map that to a brain

236
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,540
um

237
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,540
or any kind of

238
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,160
system with discrete units that are

239
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,920
close sometimes and not so close then

240
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,019
the arrangement of those will constrain

241
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,779
necessarily the base graph

242
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,300
to some degree

243
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,980
if you if they're right next to each

244
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,240
other

245
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
then there's going to be a greater

246
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,360
chance that they are

247
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,120
Independence

248
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
some sort of dependency relationship

249
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,720
even if the from like disparate

250
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,600
you know far away neurons are actually

251
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,820
more strongly correlated they will have

252
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,279
to travel through those in some sense

253
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
the the network there right

254
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,860
um so

255
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,980
I'm not sure if that's clear but the

256
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,420
what I'm saying is that the physical

257
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,540
proximity and adjacencies in a physical

258
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,279
system kind of

259
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
partially correlate to something like a

260
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,480
markup blanket like the constraints the

261
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,639
possible operation in the system

262
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,279
yes it can

263
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,300
and also this was a major Topic in the

264
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,040
recent

265
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
51 live streams

266
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,980
like we talked about how different by

267
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,519
like the pomdp structure partially

268
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,139
observable more composition process

269
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,779
structure or just generally the active

270
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,240
Bayesian graph representation of a

271
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
generative model

272
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,019
that's not

273
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,839
the anatomy that would carry out that

274
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,459
model

275
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,079
you would need to make a neural network

276
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,079
with a totally different connectivity to

277
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,420
implement that model

278
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,060
and so we discussed how do you get

279
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,500
from

280
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,660
a stated base graph

281
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,720
to a neural network architecture that

282
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,779
carries out that computation

283
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,060
which helps integrate it more closely

284
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,620
with experimental results and also

285
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,079
software packages and different kinds of

286
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,000
computational heuristics

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,940
and then how do you get from a neural

288
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,440
network

289
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,200
to a pomdp

290
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,279
and so this Paper 51

291
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,160
establishes this relationship

292
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,519
formally as well as empirically

293
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,279
so it's

294
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,940
extremely important reading slash

295
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,120
listening in the space of beyond the um

296
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,579
more foundational points that have been

297
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:36,959
made in the last several minutes which

298
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,180
is just simply

299
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,180
these kinds of graphs

300
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,040
are not

301
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,800
these kinds of graphs

302
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
that's just two different categories of

303
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,180
visual representations that both use

304
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,860
nodes and edges but they're describing

305
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,260
different things with nodes and edges

306
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,600
and then to go deeper and to understand

307
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,120
exactly how biological and artificial

308
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,160
neural architectures

309
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,740
implements the kinds of generative

310
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,639
models specified by a Bayesian graph

311
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,519
then the paper discussed in 51 is the

312
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,800
most recent and advanced discussion on

313
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,399
it in the field

314
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,300
okay

315
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,240
how are categories actually encoded in

316
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,560
the brain

317
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,320
so can you can you add that reference

318
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,120
there oh sure

319
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,899
thank you

320
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,600
yeah

321
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,019
and they've done work in in silico

322
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,160
in vitro neurons and in Vivo animals it

323
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,540
seems like

324
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,220
so

325
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,100
funny there's fef free energy functional

326
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,079
but it's definitely not that

327
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,260
and there's been other

328
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,019
discussions of just structural versus

329
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,180
effective and functional connectivity in

330
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,139
the brain

331
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,940
all right so how are categories actually

332
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,579
encoded in the brain and Neil added a

333
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,819
comment

334
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,899
I understand that prediction errors are

335
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,699
thought to be encoded as pulse density

336
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,639
I.E frequency modulated Spike trains as

337
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,620
measured on single neurons

338
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,000
this might lead us to think that

339
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
categories are encoded in single neurons

340
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,839
like the notorious grandmother and

341
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,180
Jennifer Aniston neurons which are

342
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,940
neurons that have been reported in

343
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,920
different studies to have an increased

344
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,380
and sometimes like specific firing rate

345
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,679
increase for a specific stimuli

346
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,660
so they'll have they'll be measuring

347
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,119
thousands of neurons and some neurons

348
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,459
fire when some image is brighter or

349
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,040
darker and some neurons don't have any

350
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,859
clear relationship with visual input but

351
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,559
then they'll find some neuron that fires

352
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,959
for Jennifer Aniston but not for other

353
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,500
closely related stimuli and so hence the

354
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,220
fame of the Jennifer Aniston neuron

355
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,820
in this schema are we really saying

356
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,280
one as far as active is concerned it

357
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,020
doesn't matter how categories are stored

358
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,600
within a cortical column components

359
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,179
we just need to model that they are with

360
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,820
associate precisions

361
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,280
two we suppose categories are stored

362
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,840
statistically somehow collectively

363
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,939
within a local population of neurons

364
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,380
Would we not expect prediction errors to

365
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,179
be represented in Spike trains on many

366
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,100
neurons coming into or going out of a

367
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,520
cortical column all right there's many

368
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,620
ways to explore this question

369
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,820
who wants to give a first thought

370
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,400
wait on you Ali yeah go for it Ellie

371
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,799
oh well actually it's a very big

372
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,320
question in the philosophy of mind and

373
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,600
the philosophy for cognitive science I

374
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,080
mean the question of how uh brain

375
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,200
represents the uh the signs and the

376
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,179
external objects but

377
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:39,720
um

378
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,240
one theory is

379
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,419
um basically based on versus the

380
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,220
taxonomy of signs uh I mean as we

381
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,600
um as many were aware uh purse

382
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,299
classifies or the signs into three types

383
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,880
of symbols icons and indices uh but

384
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,440
when we want when we

385
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,260
apply this taxonomy

386
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,679
in the representation mechanism of brain

387
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,100
basically what we need at the very first

388
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,799
as as a very first step is to understand

389
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,760
how the brain represents indices and

390
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,100
icons

391
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,120
as a kind of

392
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,640
representation processes that would need

393
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,400
minimal amount of Consciousness right so

394
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,039
uh for indices and icons uh I mean the

395
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,140
difference between indices and I icons

396
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,200
are that icons are a kind of uh

397
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,380
structural structure preserving maps and

398
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,940
indices uh are uh we in indices we have

399
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,799
a kind of causal relationship between

400
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,340
the signs and their reference so before

401
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,160
uh

402
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,919
um before uh we

403
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:05,900
um

404
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,299
representing uh the tokens of an object

405
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,660
as an index of an external object we

406
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,960
need to have a kind of map or an icon in

407
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,780
order to map that in that token of index

408
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,000
to our icon right so one theory for

409
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,820
doing that is so-called homuncular

410
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,700
theory proposed by Daniel Dennett in

411
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,660
which he proposes a hierarchy of

412
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,020
subjects with decreasing levels of

413
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,240
consciousness

414
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,720
and on the bottom most level We have

415
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,900
basically non-conscious non-conscious

416
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:56,940
subject to somehow grasps the icon in

417
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,500
a kind of just a

418
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,559
representational map without uh

419
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
interpreting it as a specific

420
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,520
um as a specific Index right but then

421
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,600
again uh it passes that representation

422
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,340
into its higher levels of hormone

423
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,299
homunculus uh with uh increasing their

424
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,240
increasing Consciousness until it

425
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,480
reaches the subject quote-unquote

426
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,659
subject which is basically our whole

427
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,460
mind so yeah it's a very big subject and

428
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,559
of course

429
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,380
it's impossible to summarize it in just

430
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,080
a couple of minutes but I would

431
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
recommend a very interesting book on

432
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,140
that subject if anyone wants to further

433
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,720
explore that the the first chapter of

434
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
materialist phenomenology by Manuel

435
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,159
enter

436
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,500
explains it with a crystal clear prose

437
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,760
what that kind of representation or how

438
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,320
that mechanism would work

439
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,820
nice

440
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,940
great answers so a few more

441
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,820
angles on this question

442
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,539
um

443
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,380
first the question of representation in

444
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,720
active and in Neuroscience is a large

445
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,100
area

446
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,760
so

447
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,400
for something to be represented

448
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
in the brain

449
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,500
it doesn't need to be what it is in the

450
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,679
outside world clearly but that leads to

451
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,900
like a lot of of course

452
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,700
um discussion about how representations

453
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,820
actually do occur in the brain

454
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,919
so the question

455
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
um was prediction errors are encoded as

456
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,600
pulse density as measured on single

457
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,640
neurons well the simple answer is it

458
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,919
just simply does not have to be that way

459
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,720
prediction errors in a different

460
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,299
cognitive system or region could be

461
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,600
encoded as the autocorrelation function

462
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,820
of the spike train

463
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,320
or there are neurons that are

464
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,580
non-spiking

465
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,679
or it could be a brain region there's

466
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,580
just no reason to uniquely associate the

467
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,700
conveyance of prediction errors

468
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,500
to the extent that statistical

469
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,780
parameters are even conveyed in

470
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,059
neuroanatomy at all which one doesn't

471
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,220
even have to agree with but to the

472
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,539
extent we're even going to talk about

473
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,020
neural phenomena as being related to to

474
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,880
statistical phenomena

475
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,940
it doesn't have to be the spiking

476
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,080
density

477
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,539
nor does it have to be on single neurons

478
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,480
now that being said

479
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,580
in the neural network

480
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,940
discussion in 51.

481
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,179
there was a relationship that they are

482
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,240
showing between the fast perceptual like

483
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,020
Dynamics and Spike firing rates and the

484
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,120
slower Dynamics and the neural

485
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,419
plasticity of the synapses so as kind of

486
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,620
before like it could be but just because

487
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,780
it could be in in some senses maybe

488
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,720
doesn't mean that those are an identical

489
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,880
mapping

490
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,260
um

491
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,120
then

492
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,780
categories are encoded in single neurons

493
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,600
um well if by that is meant encoded by

494
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,179
firing sensitivities in networks of

495
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,659
neurons

496
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,140
then there is already more being taken

497
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,580
into account it's kind of like figure

498
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,679
and ground it's not like that neuron

499
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,559
taken out of that Network would still

500
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,039
signal Jennifer Aniston the semantics of

501
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,960
a given category

502
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,539
are associated with the inputs and

503
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,539
outputs even in cases where there is a

504
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,820
statistically tight relationship between

505
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,340
the firing activity of some neuron and

506
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,080
some other category being identified

507
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,220
um then

508
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,419
are we really saying

509
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,919
it doesn't matter how categories are

510
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,260
stored we just need a model that they

511
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,679
are so that is an instrumentalist

512
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,940
perspective

513
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,100
which is just saying

514
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,880
whatever the neurological substrate is

515
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,679
of

516
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,960
how categories are enacted and

517
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,299
represented in the brain

518
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,700
we're going to use a specific type of

519
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,840
model

520
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,419
that is super tractable supercomposable

521
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,340
translates across systems and so on

522
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,380
hashtag active

523
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,760
and we're not saying that's the

524
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,919
architecture of the system

525
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,260
so that's an easy instrumentalist

526
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,559
position that can always be taken

527
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,200
and we suppose that categories are

528
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,120
stored statistically somehow

529
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,620
collectively within a local population

530
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,720
of neurons that's an empirical

531
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,779
hypothesis one could test whether a

532
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,700
population rate code

533
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,880
or a area of activity

534
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,820
or other aspects of neural function that

535
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,679
aren't even as commonly discussed

536
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,659
depending on the specific question come

537
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,580
into play

538
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,159
Would we not expect prediction errors to

539
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,720
be represented on Spike trains on many

540
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,520
neurons coming into and going out of

541
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,360
if you expect it if that's your prior

542
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
then you expect it if it's not your

543
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,179
prior you don't expect it

544
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,059
there might be anatomical or statistical

545
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,220
reasons

546
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,900
to

547
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,480
scaffold the belief

548
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,000
that there would be a many input many

549
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,580
output system or not

550
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,200
but it can't be answered in the general

551
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,279
those are just the examples of Empirical

552
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,419
neuroanatomical research to actually

553
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,840
pursue

554
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,580
um Brock how do you see it related to

555
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,539
viveki

556
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,740
um I mean relevance realization is uh

557
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,020
uh I mean very roughly like

558
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
opponent processing it's I mean it's

559
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't I don't really

560
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,120
understand the fundamentals of precisely

561
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,820
how that would work in a

562
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,460
neurological physiological sense

563
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,440
um

564
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,419
but it's kind of again like I guess you

565
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,980
could uh like

566
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,679
yeah the promotions there

567
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,320
um but

568
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,419
um yeah that just that you're

569
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,720
contrasting like different

570
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,100
um fittedness I guess of um

571
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,059
in in the live stream he gave this I

572
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:54,120
guess example of um like a dog versus a

573
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,039
four-legged animal versus a mammal or

574
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,900
whatever why did they say the dog ran by

575
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,120
sort of thing

576
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,020
um is that that has a good fit

577
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,620
um

578
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,559
and that

579
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,500
realized relevance is somehow related to

580
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,900
opponent processing

581
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,419
um so it's it's that's I guess a way in

582
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,720
which it's related to categories or very

583
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,159
crudely like

584
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,260
General differentiation or something

585
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,520
like this

586
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,580
um

587
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,539
tangentially related I don't know yeah I

588
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,740
don't know it's like a conceptual

589
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,679
approach too yeah there's always

590
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,140
different coarse grainings of categories

591
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,659
that can be appealed to

592
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,900
in speech or in the brain

593
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,279
and so outside of contrived

594
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,159
you know sorting tasks

595
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,340
in the more open-endedness of the niche

596
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,720
that the systems have to engage with

597
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,520
the categorization

598
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,419
[Music]

599
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,360
is has different characteristics

600
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,200
than like a binary sorting task

601
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,720
so that's that's what viviki ties to

602
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,080
relevance

603
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,860
okay

604
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,320
does anyone want to add another question

605
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,120
or thought on five

606
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,559
what other neural systems or behaviors

607
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,899
are people interested in modeling

608
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,700
foreign

609
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,200
but also in that in that uh diagram

610
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
behind the

611
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,600
window there there's goals

612
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,360
Golds yeah where did those come from

613
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,840
seems like um

614
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,399
I guess you could do planning without

615
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,279
goals but it seems like goals a goal

616
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,200
there would be a

617
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,299
kind of a reason to plan to get a

618
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,200
biological goal of like

619
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,419
homeostasis right lsasis is sort of this

620
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,320
sort of

621
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,640
there was a live stream you guys did

622
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,159
recently on that right

623
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,720
and then

624
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,940
some more subjective cultural thing yeah

625
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,740
I don't know

626
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,620
yeah well here

627
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,740
um with the more narrow

628
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,179
goal interpretation

629
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,820
the difference is between the direct and

630
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,039
the indirect policy selection Pathways

631
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,159
in the stratum which is mediated by

632
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,720
gamma

633
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
the dopamine signaling

634
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,919
and so here on this left side

635
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,340
the habits dominate policy selection

636
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,880
so e represents the affordances but it's

637
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,740
not just like affordances are not just

638
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,159
like yes no in the E vector

639
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,020
they represent

640
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,039
the prior probabilities of given actions

641
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,520
so where an affordance is impossible it

642
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,919
is given a prior probability of zero and

643
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,720
therefore it's never selected

644
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,020
where the prior probability on some

645
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,840
action affordance being engaged in is

646
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,159
high

647
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,679
it's more likely to be undertaken so e

648
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,020
is not just like a list

649
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,299
of what you can choose from it's not

650
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,940
like a menu It's like a menu of actions

651
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,779
that's weighted by habit

652
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,299
in this Construction

653
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,679
and so

654
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,419
in the absence

655
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,880
of any kind of pragmatic or epistemic

656
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,500
value which is to say free energy

657
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,460
minimization

658
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,440
Behavior recapitulates The Habit

659
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,980
so there's a mode of policy selection pi

660
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,840
where the entity is merely

661
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,580
recapitulating

662
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,620
probabilistically

663
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,520
their history and habits

664
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,200
that's shown on the left side of the

665
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,640
stratum

666
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,000
then the right side of the stratum

667
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,620
shows the cortical engagement

668
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,120
of

669
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,240
seemingly more goal directed whether

670
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,820
pragmatic goal directed and or epistemic

671
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,500
goal directed

672
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,240
or as we think about it in active

673
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,960
inference them the pragmatic and

674
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,940
epistemic integration

675
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,120
into a single imperative G

676
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,039
like

677
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,779
um let's just say I usually walk up and

678
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,059
down but I rarely go left and right and

679
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,559
I'm in a maze

680
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,320
this left mode

681
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,100
of policy selection is just going to be

682
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,140
recapitulating the decisions previously

683
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,159
made

684
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,480
the right mode is going to ideally

685
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,179
strike a balance between pragmatic and

686
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,220
epistemic value

687
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,100
but any discussion of pragmatic and

688
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,320
epistemic value so pragmatic value

689
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,840
bringing alignments reducing the

690
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,299
Divergence between your preferences and

691
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,559
observations

692
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,299
getting what you want getting what you

693
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,380
expect

694
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,899
an epistemic value reducing your

695
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,779
uncertainty gaining information

696
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,080
any discussion of the relative merits of

697
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,120
different policies

698
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,039
in terms of their expected free energy

699
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,679
which again is to say they're relative

700
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,260
or

701
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,780
relative pragmatic and epistemic value

702
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,379
any evaluation of policy

703
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,899
is a different cognitive and

704
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,379
computational process

705
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,560
than merely the recapitulation of habits

706
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,080
which doesn't require any consideration

707
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,819
of policies at all

708
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,199
so this is kind of like walking forward

709
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,000
walking into the future

710
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,859
looking backwards

711
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,839
I mean in some deeper sense aren't we

712
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,040
always

713
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,099
but this e-mediated mode of decision

714
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,540
making

715
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,379
does not require any evaluation of

716
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:48,000
counterfactuals or comparison of

717
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,940
alternative outcomes

718
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,179
now where do habits and preferences come

719
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,199
from

720
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,640
because if under G the pragmatic value

721
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,760
is going to be associated with

722
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,080
prior probabilities on preferences

723
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,680
and um epistemic information as well is

724
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,420
going to be mediated by priors which

725
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,740
here are being shown as kind of

726
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,780
cortically embodied

727
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,160
where do those parameters come from

728
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,740
Evolution ecology development and

729
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,140
behavior over different time scales

730
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,380
so the coarse grained priors are

731
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,359
inherited

732
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,260
through the process of evolution

733
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,500
and then finer and finer scale

734
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,720
adjustments can occur

735
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,119
via ecological and developmental

736
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,400
processes

737
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,640
culminating in learning

738
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,220
and at the very fast scale perception

739
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,359
that's the deflationary approach which

740
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,460
would be Evolution has put all those

741
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,200
tested processes Evolution ecology

742
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,540
development Behavior learning and then

743
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,740
perception

744
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
put that entity's generative model in

745
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,960
the context of a generative process

746
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,240
into

747
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,180
an Adaptive position

748
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,640
if it's not adaptive that far from

749
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,440
equilibrium system is going to quickly

750
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,480
dissipate you just saw something in its

751
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,980
last day

752
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,220
or it's not its last day and then the

753
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,020
inference is going to continue Giuseppe

754
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,020
yes

755
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,079
[Music]

756
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,460
something that is not too clear to me

757
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,820
habits are supposedly supposedly they do

758
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,099
refer

759
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:49,980
uh to things that are learned during the

760
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,859
lifetime of the agent

761
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:53,520
um

762
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,780
as opposed to being a

763
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,680
deposited through Evolution for instance

764
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,740
because one could say also that the the

765
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,740
the policies with high pragmatic values

766
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,820
that that are the one that preserve the

767
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,280
phenotype of the agent are kind of

768
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,500
habits but they pertain to the longer

769
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,160
time scale of uh phylogenesis so to say

770
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,260
so

771
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,880
so is there

772
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,460
the distinction here

773
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,400
like the specific of habits the

774
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,020
characteristic of web is is that they

775
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,680
have been learned they they are they

776
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,900
come from a statistical regularities

777
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,920
that have been uh accrued and

778
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,300
represented through the lifetime of the

779
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,420
agent to the experience of the of the

780
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,700
agent

781
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,859
I believe that it doesn't have to be

782
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,500
only learned during the lifetime like

783
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,420
let's just say that there's a species of

784
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,400
bird that flies at night

785
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,040
it habitually flies at night

786
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,200
and then you can zoom in more and say

787
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,900
now within that bird species they're the

788
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,180
early risers and the late risers

789
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,220
and this one is habitually Rising early

790
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,660
and that one's habitually Rising late

791
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,839
now that may be a genetic polymorphism

792
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,820
that doesn't even have to be learned at

793
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,780
all

794
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,780
so I think of course in humans we take a

795
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,760
very developmental learning based

796
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
approach towards the habits and you know

797
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,540
Aristotle you know Excellence is what we

798
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,820
repeatedly do and all of that but when

799
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,800
we just think about habit as what is

800
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,020
habitually done then it's a little bit

801
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,280
clearer that it's not necessarily

802
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,560
learned

803
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,300
but then once you couldn't you

804
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,320
subsume the

805
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,800
like the the tendency to fly more at

806
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,099
night as a as a preference that is

807
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,480
within

808
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,450
the

809
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,180
[Music]

810
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,339
within the

811
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,740
yeah as a preference like within the

812
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,079
same Matrix

813
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,099
yes and in some

814
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,119
um convergent evolution scenario

815
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,839
we would see the Habit distribution

816
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,619
recapitulating the preference

817
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,940
distribution increasingly mindlessly

818
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,160
offloading the cognitive work of

819
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,500
evaluating policies

820
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,540
and reducing Divergence through free

821
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,579
energy minimization

822
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,220
we might expect some of that

823
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,099
to become habitualized

824
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,740
and merely reflected through the

825
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,200
affordances that can be taken or the

826
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,060
probability of different affordances in

827
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,740
terms of their prior preferences or

828
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,400
prior probabilities on affordances

829
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,020
um rather than needing to be mediated

830
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,520
through preference that's one answer and

831
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,000
another kind of corollary answer is on

832
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,500
one hand we can talk about preferences

833
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,839
over any distribution

834
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,599
but in the bird example

835
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,500
um

836
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,900
the preference for flying at night might

837
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,940
not be a category that's accessible to

838
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,720
it

839
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,220
but

840
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,619
preferences

841
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,040
that have to do with um

842
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,240
the amount of photons being detected

843
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,000
might interact synergistically with

844
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,839
habits around like a circadian rhythm or

845
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,900
habits around flapping your wings

846
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,760
like once the wing is flapped up it

847
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,680
always flaps down

848
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,480
that doesn't even need to be

849
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,640
computationally modeled as a policy

850
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,500
decision

851
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,960
because it could be relying on these

852
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,900
regions of the brain or these kinds of

853
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,880
pathways

854
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
that don't explicitly consider

855
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,960
alternatives in the same way

856
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,000
and I think again as we discussed at the

857
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,440
beginning this isn't the literal

858
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,420
interpretation of the neuroanatomy but

859
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,900
it's kind of showing two extreme

860
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,359
um ends of a continuum

861
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,099
with

862
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,320
um the least to the most explicit

863
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
consideration

864
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,579
of future policies

865
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,859
with all the pros and cons of turning

866
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,359
the volume up turning the volume down

867
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,359
and the volume is computationally

868
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,040
analogous to the role of dopamine

869
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
signaling in the striatum

870
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,180
and in insects Ollie

871
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,300
uh yeah and uh another slightly

872
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,720
different take on this subject is laid

873
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,440
out by J Scott Kelso in his book Dynamic

874
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,240
patterns the self-organization of brain

875
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,980
and behavior uh in which uh he says that

876
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,760
because uh the state of uh all the

877
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,380
possibilities are too complex to be

878
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,099
calculated at each um at each time and

879
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,940
for each decision

880
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,060
he uh he lays out something like this

881
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,119
that if we look at it and look at the

882
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,880
state of the possibilities

883
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,760
um in terms of its uh distribution of

884
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,820
singularities and the basins and The

885
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,480
Well of those singularities or or the

886
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,880
attractors of uh the Basin of attractors

887
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,140
the policy making can be achieved by uh

888
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,320
by the effect of the param by the effect

889
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,480
of adjusting the parameter and the

890
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,560
proximity of those Wells or basins so

891
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,960
for example

892
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,000
manipulating that parameter parameter to

893
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,720
make some wells or basins shallow with

894
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,700
the result that the associated preferred

895
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,520
state becomes less stable so in this

896
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,579
condition random fluctuations actually

897
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:54,060
can spontaneously somehow dislodge the

898
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,420
system from a data space that estate and

899
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,200
push it into another state so in this

900
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,119
case

901
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,200
The Habit can also be explained by the

902
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,420
varying degrees of these kind of

903
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,940
parameter adjustments throughout all the

904
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,680
state of possibility States

905
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,359
awesome yeah

906
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,819
yeah this is this is

907
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,599
very interesting one one subject in

908
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:31,260
which I'm

909
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,819
[Music]

910
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm interested in applying uh the active

911
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,060
inference framework is uh on a

912
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,000
meditative practice and actually it has

913
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,359
been one proposal is that

914
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,900
it may work exactly like that so that uh

915
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,760
the the tractors that are very deep and

916
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,220
um and are firmly Consolidated through

917
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,740
habits through meditative practice

918
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,720
becomes shallower also that the

919
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,900
range of possibilities of

920
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,599
behavior and perception becomes larger

921
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,119
because you you you you are not

922
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,460
constrained by this deep Wells of uh of

923
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,859
uh of energy that have been established

924
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,900
through your habits but the interesting

925
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,940
thing here the Intriguing part is that

926
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,440
through a very

927
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,079
uh

928
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:30,240
repetitive practice kind of repetitive

929
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,880
practice you are you some how make your

930
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,800
uh energy landscape more shallow at

931
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,300
least at least

932
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,359
at least during the practice so it's a

933
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,099
it's an interesting this paradoxical

934
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,619
aspect how you

935
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,920
you could somehow

936
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,980
train with the very habitual practice to

937
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,079
weaken your habits

938
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,760
oh just extremely not of a tangent here

939
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,660
but

940
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,300
it's totally interesting and one could

941
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,980
imagine

942
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,700
um

943
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,700
real practices or simulated

944
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,220
computational agents that engage in

945
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,680
repetitive actions and that just

946
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,140
sharpens it doesn't open their mind a

947
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,240
lot of meditation is not about expanding

948
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,160
one's mind or changing one's Behavior

949
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,099
it's actually about converging to

950
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,800
a certain regime of attention

951
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,740
and sharpening distributions that exist

952
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,540
during the practice and after the

953
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,619
practice

954
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,960
there are other cases where we can

955
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,599
modulate our receptivity

956
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:45,060
through repetitive actions

957
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,119
and being exposed to just merely novelty

958
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,960
all the time doesn't necessarily

959
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,000
breed novelty in US it might just

960
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,619
confuse us

961
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,020
mm-hmm

962
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,680
yeah

963
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,700
yeah Brock some habits are reciprocally

964
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,200
narrowing some are reciprocally opening

965
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,439
yeah

966
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,500
yeah they can look very similar

967
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,060
and without

968
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,619
um the ability to see the cognitive

969
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,660
states of another

970
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,020
if somebody's just sitting quietly

971
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,760
maybe they're narrowing maybe they're

972
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,859
opening maybe they're

973
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,660
sleeping

974
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,520
well to your point you mean about you

975
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,680
know like some basic version of

976
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,359
meditation of just like focus on your

977
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,380
breathing

978
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,660
was like sharpening and narrowing it but

979
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,160
in doing that

980
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,740
over time you kind of grow this capacity

981
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,920
to modulate your attention more

982
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,839
on other things more intentionally right

983
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,339
um so

984
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,099
right probably not

985
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:57,140
perhaps this idea that by doing that by

986
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,359
deploying attention more on the sensory

987
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,920
aspect you kind of avoid a little bit or

988
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,200
bias the usual drift of precision

989
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,700
upwards toward more like Superior layers

990
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,500
of the hierarchy associated with mind

991
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,460
wandering Etc

992
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,578
so this

993
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,740
wrong one would you like to add anything

994
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:48,960
okay

995
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,819
awesome I'm going to copy your comment

996
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,960
in so we can read this

997
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,960
I would put forward here the practice of

998
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,640
Alexander technique where we optimize

999
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,280
Precision by repetitive action I.E

1000
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,859
getting in and out of a chair whilst

1001
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,800
inhibiting and directing

1002
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,339
hmm

1003
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,330
yeah it'd be interesting to

1004
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:13,680
[Music]

1005
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,359
um

1006
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,180
with this three

1007
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,540
region neuroanatomical model

1008
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,800
yeah

1009
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,380
Oracle

1010
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,079
the most cognitive most semantically

1011
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,619
accessible

1012
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,540
the midbrain striatum

1013
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,260
most dopamergically associated with this

1014
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,660
um Continuum between habitual and goal

1015
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,359
directed policy selection and then

1016
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:45,420
action mediated in the peripheral

1017
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,420
nervous system through

1018
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,359
um Divergence minimization

1019
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,660
and then

1020
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,839
sketch out

1021
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,260
I'm sure

1022
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,280
and then sketch out yeah like um in the

1023
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,000
Parkinson's case where there's a loss of

1024
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,380
dopaminergic signaling

1025
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,940
um which can in the extreme lead to like

1026
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,460
failures of initiating and planning

1027
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,660
action

1028
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,980
and then

1029
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,839
um there was a

1030
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,280
um

1031
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,359
thank you

00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,900
this movie is about a uh early on

1035
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,000
Oliver Sacks wrote that book but then

1036
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,880
there's a Robin Williams movie

1037
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,200
and um there was a floor of patients in

1038
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,660
a Medical Institution

1039
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,119
who were all suffering from basically

1040
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,579
these different symptoms that today

1041
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,800
could be recognized as like hypo

1042
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,079
dopaminergic

1043
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:58,740
um

1044
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,319
signaling and then

1045
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:02,220
um

1046
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,319
the doctor goes to a conference learns

1047
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,660
about l-dopa which is like a pre a

1048
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,880
metabolic precursor of dopamine so

1049
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,800
dopamine does not cross the blood-brain

1050
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,180
barrier in mammals however l-dopa does

1051
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,040
and um

1052
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,760
then that like awakens people but it

1053
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,380
shows

1054
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,400
um

1055
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,740
like some of the motor and cognitive

1056
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,200
consequences of hypo and Hyper

1057
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,460
dopaminergic signaling

1058
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:33,300
um one question for me is where does

1059
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,220
reasoning fit into thicker 5.5

1060
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,140
the gears of thought

1061
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,460
where's the transmission in the

1062
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,059
carburetor

1063
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:59,700
like those are great

1064
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,020
questions so there's probably many

1065
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,859
different

1066
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:02,520
um

1067
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,619
angles to take on it

1068
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:06,079
one

1069
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,280
angle is like reasoning is a a synonym

1070
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,300
of inference

1071
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:19,040
and so by pointing to reasoning

1072
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,780
we are talking about

1073
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,359
families of inferential structures

1074
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,160
and so depending on what that reasoning

1075
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,700
is about

1076
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:36,319
it could manifest in different ways

1077
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,779
and so like yeah Ali

1078
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,220
actually helmholz proposes that

1079
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,160
reasoning can as you said it can be it

1080
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,140
can be done also unconsciously as

1081
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,079
inference so uh actually one of the

1082
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,420
starting points of this whole area

1083
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,000
Bayesian brain hypothesis and probably

1084
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,619
its origin is uh helmholtz essay I

1085
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,280
forgot its exact name from 1866 or

1086
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,599
something in which he proposes a theory

1087
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,380
of unconscious inference or unconscious

1088
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:18,140
uh conclusion uh in which uh sometimes

1089
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,660
reasoning actually most of the time the

1090
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,599
majority of our reasoning processes are

1091
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,200
not done in our conscious levels so uh

1092
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,760
yeah I also agree with you that

1093
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,660
reasoning can be taken as a synonymous

1094
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,578
for these kind of inferences as well

1095
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,380
yeah but like on the experiential

1096
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,859
side it is so

1097
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,740
fascinating and mysterious

1098
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,440
stimuli are presented

1099
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,599
certainly there are

1100
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,640
um unconscious inferences that

1101
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,200
facilitate even the initial

1102
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,079
understanding of a stimuli

1103
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,119
like a visual stimuli like seeing a

1104
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,579
letter as a letter

1105
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:08,640
seeing a handle for grabbing is kind of

1106
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,059
the ecological inactivist angle

1107
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,700
but seeing a symbol or sign and that

1108
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,800
kind of invokes what Ali described

1109
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,460
earlier with the theory of semiosis

1110
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,140
but then

1111
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,900
we wait

1112
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,440
and we feel like we reason

1113
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,480
and we

1114
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,059
make decisions

1115
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,720
and so how to

1116
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,099
[Music]

1117
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,099
um

1118
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,160
how to square the graphical models

1119
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,940
of inference which is to say reasoning

1120
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,500
with that yeah Brock

1121
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,000
I was just gonna ask I guess where

1122
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
mental action fits into this on policy

1123
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,520
selection or habits or goals like

1124
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,940
yeah yeah

1125
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,300
like um I yeah I I think the vast

1126
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,880
majority of this is yeah that you get

1127
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,319
like this base

1128
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,819
unconscious inference but at some point

1129
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,559
it feels like there's something

1130
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,720
conscious there about selecting between

1131
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,119
two things sometimes

1132
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:26,400
it really

1133
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,079
intentional and

1134
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,059
thinking real hard

1135
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,059
um so I wonder what that is I guess

1136
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:34,079
yeah

1137
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,740
Giuseppe

1138
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,319
something about going back to habits

1139
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,020
something that I just thought about

1140
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,559
um so usually habitual actions from the

1141
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,980
point of view from the psychological and

1142
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,559
phenomenological point of view are

1143
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,859
they seem to require

1144
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:58,440
much less mental energy or psychological

1145
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,280
energy so we can think about that in

1146
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,319
terms of uh you know the theory of

1147
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,079
system one and system two like by then

1148
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,839
economy and

1149
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,859
I wonder if they're seeing they seem to

1150
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:18,180
have some preferential uh low levels of

1151
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,960
of free energy also of expected free

1152
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,720
energy uh the police the habitual

1153
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,420
policies compared to other policies that

1154
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,059
somehow

1155
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,280
mirrors there

1156
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,400
they're relatively low investment of

1157
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,800
energy psychologically

1158
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,220
yeah well that's been

1159
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,680
a hotly debated topic

1160
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,960
and one of the most mystifying

1161
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,420
observations

1162
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,660
is that the brain does not change in

1163
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,880
metabolic activity greatly

1164
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,700
depending on the task and so there's all

1165
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,920
these amazing analogies between Freud

1166
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,680
and free energy and all these things

1167
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,359
that Psalms and fristians and others

1168
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,859
have worked on and of course the

1169
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:07,260
tantalizing connections between free

1170
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:12,660
energy minimization and energetic

1171
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,599
um balance

1172
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:20,160
and the um fmri signal that's being

1173
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,859
studied is the brain oxygen levels

1174
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:25,920
changing bold signal and also people can

1175
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,099
study the glucose metabolism

1176
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:33,839
but these levels of change

1177
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,180
are very small

1178
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,780
in brain metabolism and glucose usage

1179
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,300
and they're not simply associated with

1180
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,760
like quote thinking hard and even

1181
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,520
necessarily cognitive demands

1182
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,640
and so it's it's like it's like a I

1183
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,720
don't know if it's a hammer without a

1184
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,220
nail or a nail without a hammer because

1185
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,859
empirically it doesn't change in energy

1186
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,140
use that much

1187
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,599
although although there was a recent

1188
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:01,859
paper

1189
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:03,720
and I think it's in

1190
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,400
it's on a big Journal I can't remember

1191
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,619
if it's nature or

1192
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:09,300
or actually

1193
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,740
it was

1194
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,660
um

1195
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,970
there was you know they proposed some

1196
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,760
[Music]

1197
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,059
some kind of uh

1198
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:22,920
approach similar to energy minimization

1199
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,260
and and that they were showing that

1200
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,540
actually the

1201
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,359
the energy

1202
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,700
spent in in synaptic communication was

1203
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,660
was uh minimized and if I I may look for

1204
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,660
it and I may post it here

1205
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,619
um

1206
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:44,400
but I wonder more specifically

1207
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,200
in this in this idea of that habitual

1208
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,460
patterns of behavior or let's say

1209
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,400
sequences of action gets shifted with

1210
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,160
practice to being process from the

1211
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,059
cortex to the basal ganglia

1212
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,880
somehow there is uh there is actually

1213
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,980
[Music]

1214
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,400
well not not only not only like a

1215
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,500
metabolic energy like in terms of

1216
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,579
glucose or Advantage but also in terms

1217
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,760
of uh really free energy so

1218
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,640
I don't know if that has been looked

1219
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,380
at

1220
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,540
uh specifically like for the basal

1221
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,420
ganglia or I don't know there must be

1222
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,160
something because

1223
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,559
it does seem that

1224
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,800
uh

1225
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,400
mental resources at least experientially

1226
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,150
are become much

1227
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,200
[Music]

1228
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,000
the requirement resources become much

1229
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,500
less once

1230
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:52,020
once you a task is automatized let's say

1231
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:55,079
yes just shortly to close this and and

1232
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,119
to address this uh

1233
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,119
final question when does passive become

1234
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,780
active inference and end planning well

1235
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,540
we could look at from a base graph

1236
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,359
perspective is action involved

1237
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,020
if the task is merely perceptual we can

1238
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,240
say that it's passive inference

1239
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,960
if ocular motor cicading is required so

1240
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,460
even if the person's in a chair but

1241
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,839
they're moving their eyeballs that could

1242
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,020
still be modeled as active inference and

1243
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,900
you'd want then a unified imperative

1244
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,299
for inference and action

1245
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:34,380
and then when is it planning well as we

1246
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,960
had some controversial discussions on in

1247
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,480
cohort one about the second half of the

1248
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,940
book is it really planning do we really

1249
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,760
see planning in this textbook

1250
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,299
um as if planning would be behavior that

1251
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:50,880
looks like it's enacting a plan like a

1252
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,760
chess player who's winning a game but

1253
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,160
the strict and narrow definition of

1254
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,420
planning might be explicit consideration

1255
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,339
of sequential actions and their

1256
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,260
consequences

1257
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,839
and preparation for those in evaluation

1258
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:09,380
of them

1259
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,559
and free energy reduction or

1260
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,119
minimization could be used in purely

1261
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,520
passive inference which is where it's

1262
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,680
widely used in general

1263
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,799
as an Evidence lower bounds and in

1264
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,440
machine learning without action in the

1265
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,760
loop

1266
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,980
so the innovation of active inference is

1267
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,740
to bring action into the fold of

1268
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,119
inference

1269
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,160
and make a unified free energy

1270
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,440
functional imperative

1271
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,200
for perceptual learning and action

1272
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,799
inference

1273
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,180
all right

1274
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,380
hope it's okay we went a few minutes

1275
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,839
over but thanks

1276
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,740
cohort 2

1277
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:53,040
next week we return

1278
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,819
for some overview and debrief look at

1279
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,380
the project ideas

1280
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,720
and also look forward to Future textbook

1281
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,660
groups so feel free to fill out the um

1282
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,240
feedback form and encourage others to do

1283
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,000
so as well and also take a look through

1284
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,040
some thoughts and add more thoughts on

1285
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,780
future groups which we'll go over next

1286
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,760
week so thank you talk to you soon
