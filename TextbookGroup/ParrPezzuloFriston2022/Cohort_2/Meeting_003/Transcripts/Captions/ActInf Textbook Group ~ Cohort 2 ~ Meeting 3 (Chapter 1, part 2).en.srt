1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:01,600
okay

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,560
well welcome everyone thanks for joining

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,839
it's september 16th and we are

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,120
in

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
the third meeting for cohort two

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
we're on our second discussion of

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
chapter one in the textbook

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680
so

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,960
this is our

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,240
um

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
closing

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
discussion on chapter one

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
which is going to be just our jumping

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
off point into

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
the following chapters

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
we'll go to the questions page where i

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,559
saw some

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,520
questions were submitted

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,079
uh and we can also look at other

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,200
areas

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,680
like just the chapter notes more

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,800
generally

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
but before we go to the questions is

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
there any just remarks that people would

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
like to share on chapter one

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,800
and then otherwise i'll i'll make one

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,000
short note about another resource

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,600
i'll be watching the hand raising too

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
well first maybe i'll just share this

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
other resource

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
and i'll it's already added to the

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,520
resources section and i'll put it in the

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,040
nearby

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
it's called pools of insight it's from

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,560
1999

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,600
however

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
um the author is still

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,960
like around and when i emailed uh

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
them

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,520
yeah this is the the most recent version

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,119
and the document is called pools of

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,479
insight

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,320
um a previous version i guess was called

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
knowledge hydrant

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,439
but again this is the most recent

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,280
version even though it's

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
almost as old as some of us might be um

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
and it's based around alexander's

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,399
christopher alexander's pattern language

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,560
which may be familiar to some it's a

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
it's a very unique

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
book

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,079
and it speaks to archetypes in

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,399
architecture and design

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
and talks about how there's composition

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,640
of patterns and

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,799
makes a language and a grammar for that

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,479
and that kind of a pattern language

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,640
approach has been built on in many other

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
settings and this

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
work

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
is a very interesting application of

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
pattern languages to learning groups

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
i think

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,400
going through it

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
could be interesting for anybody who's

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,520
just

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,360
curious about this

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,800
approach of pattern languages and

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
learning groups

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
and also we're very interested to apply

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,080
this

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
more intentionally

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
as we continue to iterate on the

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
learning groups format

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,879
in active inference institute

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
textbook groups for years to come and

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,080
new textbooks to come and so on

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
um

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
just looking at the titles

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
there's a lot of insight

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,840
like the book is a knowledge hydrant

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
how do we even approach that

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,599
the group is like a pool of insight how

85
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
do we approach that you know how are we

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
going to integrate

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
our individual study

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
with group

89
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,440
dialogue so

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,239
not

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
much more to say on this today

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
but if anyone's like excited about that

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
it would be awesome to hear their um

94
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
how they see these patterns playing out

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
because a lot of them

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
um

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,560
speak to what we want to cultivate

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,879
in this group

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
okay

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,238
going to the questions page

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
there's still also time for people to be

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,760
adding in

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,879
a

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
a brock i put it in the um nearby not

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
the room i'll add it there too

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
and it's also in resources you can just

107
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,799
look up you know

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,480
fools

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,119
you'll find it

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,760
people may still add more

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,879
questions

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
to the page but we have some really rich

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
questions provided already

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
so we'll start with a smaller one

115
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,919
in relation to perception action loops

116
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,400
the book states the possibilities for

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
control and adaptation are plentiful but

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
very few are useful

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,479
i'm not sure how useful is being used

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,759
here useful for evolution survival what

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
determines useful

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,680
page four

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
what does anyone

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
see or think

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
so i don't know i would just venture to

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
jump up the cliff and guess that maybe

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
the authors mean like full

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,919
maintenance of

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,080
the non-equilibrium steady state density

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
or like existence

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
just to guess though

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
all right what's the non-equilibrium

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,560
steady state

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
it is like the the balance of

135
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,280
of all things that we find ourselves in

136
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
as living creatures so like you know i'm

137
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,960
a human

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,759
i

139
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
have you know a certain amount of cells

140
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
tissues and organs i have

141
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
a temperature that i

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
expect to find my body at and like a

143
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
range of temperatures that i can survive

144
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
in i need a certain concentration of

145
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
oxygen my blood oxygen needs to be

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
maintained at that level so just like

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
all of the things that like i need to

148
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
have a certain amount of water

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,479
like like all of the things that

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,759
contribute to

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,919
me being able to persist

152
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
as in my non-equilibrium steady state so

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
it's like you know if you're in

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,479
equilibrium as a biological organism you

155
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,600
are dead

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,319
so

157
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,280
um

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,720
life is maintained in this

159
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,199
non-equilibrium steady state

160
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
and i think that we have to

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
be able to maintain that

162
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
and maybe the authors just need

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
maintenance

164
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,240
useful in the maintenance of that

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,520
non-equilibrium steady state

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
great

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
yes so one

168
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
qualitative way to frame it is with

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
persistence in survival

170
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
not saying this is the only meaning of

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,199
utility

172
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
but persistence and survival are

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
imperatives for

174
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,479
things

175
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,000
again using thing in the active

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
inference sense as like the particular

177
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,280
states

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,800
the blanket states and the internal

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,759
states

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,120
for things

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
that are to persist

182
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
then they have to at least be acting

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
in a survivable way things that are

184
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
acting as to not persist are not going

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
to be around for long

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
things that are acting as if they are to

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
persist will be repeatedly measured

188
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,039
they'll be repeatedly observed

189
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,319
by others

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,919
or they'll be repeatedly observing

191
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,880
themself in the autopoetic case

192
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
and then blue brought in um

193
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
a nice

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,039
term from the actin pontology

195
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
which is the non-equilibrium steady

196
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,759
state

197
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,080
and by like mousing over you can see

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
some of the definitions that have been

199
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,560
provided

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
and this is all part of the work that

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
people can contribute to if they want to

202
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
be improving definitions and so on

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
and the first definition is

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,080
slightly more technical

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,440
the second

206
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
definition is slightly less technical

207
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,720
and it just says it's a system with

208
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,639
dynamics that are unchanging or out of

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,280
stationarity in some state

210
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,000
so

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,240
um that doesn't mean the system is

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
static or unchanging

213
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
it's like a dynamic balance

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,280
so we can think about like the length of

215
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
a bone isn't a dynamic balance between

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
um being built up and being broken down

217
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,759
and so that maintenance of a

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,840
non-equilibrium steady state is

219
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
maintained

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,839
kind of like homeostasis or like body

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
temperature blood sugar etc like blue

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
mentioned in the long run

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,279
um

224
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,080
and that may take energy that may be

225
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,720
like an exothermic process to maintain

226
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
there

227
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
but it also is maintaining a stasis in

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
some other respect

229
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
um

230
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
so again few are useful

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
what is this first part why are the

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
possibilities for control and adaptation

233
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,760
plentiful and why does that present an

234
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
issue ali

235
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
uh i was just gonna mention the three

236
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
phases of bayesian mechanics

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,640
i mean

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
mode matching dynamics mode tracking

239
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,839
dynamics and path tracking dynamics

240
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
from which

241
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,680
active inference dynamics

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
falls in the category of the path

243
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
tracking dynamics

244
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,120
but

245
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
unlike the first two types i mean mode

246
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
matching dynamics and mode tracking

247
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,760
dynamics

248
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,800
which

249
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,120
requires density

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
i mean which requires ness assumption

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,279
uh

252
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,320
the

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
path tracking dynamics

254
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
yeah that's it uh is present is

255
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,000
described as a known as assumption

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
dynamics so

257
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
if we

258
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
extend the active inference framework to

259
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,680
include not only

260
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,519
the

261
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,040
i mean nest preserving dynamic to all

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,080
the other kinds of agents which

263
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,560
uh just do this kind of path tracking

264
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,000
dynamic then uh i guess we would not

265
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
need uh

266
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
any kind of nest preserving

267
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,079
mechanism

268
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,200
to do these kind of action perception

269
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,560
the perception action loops

270
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
very

271
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
interesting

272
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
um this is

273
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,839
bringing in another resource which is an

274
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,279
excellent contemporary resource

275
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,480
um

276
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
which is some of the recent work of

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
ramstead at all

278
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
on on bayesian mechanics

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
and it's it's unpacked in guest stream

280
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
23.1

281
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
so that that's one very nice resource um

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
and

283
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
coming back to what blue set about

284
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,399
non-equilibrium steady states we can

285
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,440
think about one case as being like

286
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
there's a fixed point

287
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,959
and we want just

288
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,839
simple convergence to a fixed point

289
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,480
and that might be useful like if utility

290
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
in a situation is defined as we want the

291
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
plate to be balanced on the stick

292
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,519
and we want it the plate to be as tall

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,040
as possible that's like kind of a

294
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,000
classical control theory setting

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
then we might want to have that one

296
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
fixed mode and that's our utility it's

297
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
not some sort of like absolute

298
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,079
theological utility it's just saying

299
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
like within this domain or aspect or

300
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
dimension

301
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
utility is going to be defined by

302
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
reducing the divergence

303
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,640
to some fixed mode

304
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
alternatively there could be a dynamic

305
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
mode following

306
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
like um there's going to be some cursor

307
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
on your screen and you're just going to

308
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
be seeking to follow it

309
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
and in that case

310
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
utility is going to be defined by the

311
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,200
divergence minimization to a moving mode

312
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,120
and then the last case is this path

313
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
matching which does introduce some um

314
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
more powerful in general

315
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,320
mathematics like um the gauge formalism

316
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
and in that case the path

317
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
distances are being divergence minimized

318
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,680
and

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,399
it brings in a super important topic

320
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
that that um

321
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,279
next i i um we'll turn to brock to give

322
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,560
a thought on

323
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,519
which is this idea of utility and

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,920
pragmatic value as divergence

325
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,399
minimization

326
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,279
we're gonna come back to that but brock

327
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,959
feel free to add what you would like

328
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
about this if you want

329
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,839
um

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,720
i mean

331
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
it's page four so

332
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
it might be there's a lot more

333
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
like as we go through this that will

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,040
kind of start helping to connect dots

335
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
but um

336
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,680
in the kind of biological

337
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,279
uh homeostasis can like example the

338
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,320
blues

339
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
um

340
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
there are just a lot of things that you

341
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,959
could do

342
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
that would not be

343
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
like you're saying in that context

344
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,839
useful

345
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,839
for the organism

346
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,560
um and there are things that you could

347
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,079
do that

348
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,560
are useful maybe in a moment but they're

349
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
not kind of

350
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
meta useful like or like creating more

351
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
usefulness or something like this for

352
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
the organism right

353
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
um

354
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
but there are are things that that an

355
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,440
organism might do that like um just kind

356
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
of put it in a place where all the

357
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
things it could do

358
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,120
are just significantly more likely to be

359
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,160
useful

360
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
and so one of those things that it might

361
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,440
do is like go find forage for like a

362
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
place where food is plentiful and then

363
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
if it gets hungry and it just starts to

364
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,480
go look then necessarily it will kind of

365
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,639
start finding food more readily than if

366
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
it hadn't gone to that patch or you know

367
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,959
humans we build houses

368
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
or some sort of structure that protects

369
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,120
us from the elements and then

370
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
you know um

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,800
if we oversleep

372
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,040
or whatever like a wild animal doesn't

373
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,199
get us and neither does the cold or the

374
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,160
maybe

375
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
in the same way like um so

376
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
that's

377
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
um

378
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
the language that the book is going to

379
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
use around that is about

380
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,000
um

381
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
free energy reduction like free energy

382
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
minimization

383
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
which is just to say

384
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,600
in some really

385
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
coarse grain not completely correct way

386
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
that like it's just taking

387
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
a lot of choices off of the table a lot

388
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,800
of actions

389
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
that um

390
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,079
would not help

391
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,040
would not

392
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
cause the thing to persist or

393
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,480
find more usefulness or

394
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,440
so

395
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
and and the

396
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
other two words here that i'm using a

397
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,680
pragmatic epistemic value

398
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,240
is the epistemic value is kind of like

399
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,519
going to

400
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
find the like foraging for the food

401
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,000
and then the

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,399
the pragmatic value is like

403
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
like actually eating getting the food or

404
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
something like that um not

405
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
exactly but

406
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
very rough

407
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
analogous sort of

408
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,680
i don't know if that's helpful but

409
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,519
that's awesome thank you

410
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,639
yeah many

411
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
pieces here so

412
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
first you mentioned like the state space

413
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,720
of possible

414
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,000
moves

415
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,079
which is what is being suggested here

416
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
with the first part of the sentence the

417
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
possibilities for control and adaptation

418
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
are plentiful

419
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,160
so we can think about those in terms of

420
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
affordances

421
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,759
which are relational capacities for

422
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,880
action

423
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,279
and the set of possible moves or

424
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,519
affordances might be large

425
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,160
however only like a vanishingly small

426
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
subset of them

427
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,560
might be useful

428
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,320
and then part of the challenge that's

429
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,759
pointed to

430
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,519
is that um

431
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
there's a recursive nature of the cycle

432
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
so it's not like we can just

433
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,519
say well you know pawn to e4 is just

434
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,199
simply a good move

435
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,480
because there's probably situations

436
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
where that like wins you the game and

437
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,279
there's probably situations where that

438
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,639
loses the game

439
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,519
so

440
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,440
within the utility defined by like a

441
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,199
game

442
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,240
there's

443
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
already immense

444
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,320
challenges in exploring these like

445
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
branching trees of outcomes

446
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,519
and just evaluating them under any

447
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,480
metric period

448
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,360
so

449
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,480
how

450
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,880
can we evaluate

451
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,399
perception

452
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,920
and action

453
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,839
and

454
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,400
planning

455
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,119
the idea that's going to come into play

456
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,839
is action and planning as divergence

457
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
minimization

458
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
this can be contrasted

459
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,640
with the notion of perception cognition

460
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,599
action planning etc as reward

461
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,760
maximization

462
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
reward maximization

463
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
is equivalent to pragmatic value

464
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,319
maximization

465
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
utility optimization

466
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,520
is pragmatic value um and we're going to

467
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
see this reflected soon

468
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
in

469
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
some of the equations to come in the

470
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,200
next chapters

471
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
but for chapter one we're still

472
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,799
addressing this like um qualitatively

473
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,720
pragmatic value is like

474
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
the task

475
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
you know time on task

476
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,679
um if

477
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,400
if

478
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
the pragmatism in the mountain climbing

479
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
example is climbing the mountain

480
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
then pragmatic value is like every inch

481
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
you take up the mountain

482
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
epistemic value would be

483
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
reducing your uncertainty about how to

484
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
achieve pragmatic value

485
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
and so

486
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,760
in that way

487
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,919
the free energy functional

488
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,480
which encompasses both pragmatic and

489
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,799
epistemic value

490
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,400
allows

491
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,520
a more adept navigation of explore and

492
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
exploit

493
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,679
because under a reward maximization

494
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,360
framework

495
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,919
it's very easy to like you know

496
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,400
turn the speaker up to 11 set the phaser

497
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,360
to stun

498
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,559
and pursue local pragmatic value

499
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,760
however

500
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
all of these second order heuristics

501
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,919
need to come into play

502
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
to reintroduce like novelty bonuses

503
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
curiosity as a second level on to this

504
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
um reward first pragmatic value first

505
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
foundation

506
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
and in contrast

507
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
the imperatives

508
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
for

509
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,799
action and

510
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,440
perception in active inference are going

511
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,039
to be built around not reward

512
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,039
maximization but

513
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,360
free energy minimization or relative

514
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,240
free energy reduction as mentioned

515
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
and that's going to be composed of

516
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,559
there's going to be multiple ways to

517
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,720
break that down what the free energy

518
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
functional is

519
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
but

520
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,559
it is going to often come down to

521
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,760
um a pragmatic element in an epistemic

522
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
element

523
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,320
um the pragmatic element

524
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,440
is going to look like again we're

525
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
just beginning

526
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
to come into these sections

527
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
the pragmatic value

528
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,280
is going to look like a reduction of

529
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,799
divergence

530
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
between preferences

531
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
and observations

532
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679
so instead of saying

533
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
well the most rewarding body temperature

534
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
for me is 37

535
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
and i'm maximizing reward by staying at

536
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
37

537
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,240
that's a reward maximization perspective

538
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,559
on temperature homeostasis

539
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,360
a divergence minimization perspective

540
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,919
surprise minimization perspective

541
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,559
on body temperature homeostasis

542
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,520
is

543
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,919
i expect and prefer

544
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
to find myself at 37

545
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
and i'm going to undertake policy to

546
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,320
reduce my surprise about finding myself

547
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,919
at 37.

548
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,960
so when i'm at 37 i'll be minimally

549
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
surprised

550
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
and as i get further i will be more and

551
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,919
more surprised

552
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,159
and then i will take pragmatic action to

553
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,520
climb that hill

554
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,679
as well as epistemic actions to find out

555
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,200
how to climb that hill

556
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
but we're going to be getting back to 37

557
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,480
by reducing the divergence between

558
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,120
preferences and outcomes

559
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,760
rather than getting to 37

560
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,919
by like

561
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,480
winning and trying to maximize reward

562
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
which is the only

563
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,480
fundamental um

564
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,159
ontology

565
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,120
for reward based learning

566
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,799
so that's how many people have in that

567
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,880
um

568
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
basal

569
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
relationship

570
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,080
between pragmatic and epistemic value

571
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,919
and active inference

572
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,600
that's where many people have found

573
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
space to explore like curiosity

574
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
and novelty and a lot of other things

575
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
will open up once we first start to

576
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
explore

577
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,960
how pragmatic and epistemic value

578
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,159
are like connected and as coequal

579
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,840
in the imperatives for active inference

580
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,120
agents and then there'll be even more

581
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,039
fun things to come like

582
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,559
again when we realize that pragmatic

583
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,159
value isn't

584
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,400
maximizing rewards simply

585
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,919
it's reducing

586
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,440
the divergence relative to expectations

587
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,919
so it's like again not um we're playing

588
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,360
chess and we're trying to maximize our

589
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,240
points and minimize their points

590
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
but we have an optimistic

591
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,559
trajectory or set of expectations and

592
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,760
then we're going to reduce the

593
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,158
divergence such that that is realized

594
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
so what determines useful

595
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,080
as with

596
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,159
many other questions there's like a

597
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
limited answer that's so limited that it

598
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400
may not feel like an answer

599
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
which is like again if we're balancing a

600
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000
plate on a stick

601
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
we may define utility as keeping the

602
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
plate up

603
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
if we were climbing a mountain we may

604
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,039
define utility in that limited dimension

605
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
as getting to the top of the mountain

606
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,720
that may feel like too narrow because we

607
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,159
might think well like but the person

608
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,320
balancing the plate i mean they have to

609
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
have a salary and they have to breathe

610
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,760
and have blood sugar and stuff like that

611
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,720
so

612
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,039
the limited answer

613
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
is like sort of just staying within the

614
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
bounds of our model and the dimensions

615
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
that we're considering

616
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
and then part of this iterative modeling

617
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
process

618
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
which especially starts to be introduced

619
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,480
in the second half of the book

620
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
but also is reflected by people's

621
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
experience

622
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,679
in

623
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,280
other modeling areas including

624
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,080
qualitative modeling areas like so then

625
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,400
it's okay so now we have the plate

626
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
balancer

627
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
and their blood sugar

628
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,159
and then are we still missing something

629
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,159
relative to the real world are we as

630
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,919
modelers still being surprised by what

631
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,440
happens

632
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,679
now we need to consider something else

633
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,799
so

634
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,400
that's like the limited

635
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
answer

636
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
which is utility is situational and

637
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,919
dimensional

638
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,480
in a narrow sense

639
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,120
and then in perhaps a slightly more like

640
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
miso or macro sense

641
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,080
utility

642
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,400
um or at least like um

643
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,600
a cousin

644
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
or a proxy of utility

645
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,640
is survival and persistence

646
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,919
because without survival and persistence

647
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,760
you're not going to be around

648
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
to even have that debate about what's

649
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
useful

650
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
so it is kind of like a prerequisite or

651
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
an enabling feature

652
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
of any

653
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,799
dimensional or like sort of one aspect

654
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
you know if you want to

655
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,060
be in the game

656
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,360
[Music]

657
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,600
to to realize any specific kind of

658
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,159
utility being in the game is like that

659
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,360
meta

660
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,799
utility

661
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,760
which

662
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
brock pointed towards with like

663
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,840
different um

664
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,919
behaviors and phenomena ranging from

665
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,679
epistemic foraging to um

666
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,440
niche construction and like building a

667
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
house

668
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,559
any other thoughts on utility

669
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,279
what determines useful

670
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,799
okay

671
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
this looks like a great

672
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
long question so i'm going to just bring

673
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
it down so we can kind of break it into

674
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,799
sections

675
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,200
um

676
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,360
can anyone describe

677
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,840
the neat and scruffy

678
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,399
distinction

679
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,880
it's on page five

680
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,919
ollie yes

681
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,559
it's again related to

682
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,640
the high road on the low road

683
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
i mean uh

684
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,640
they've described the high road as

685
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,679
the needs

686
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,559
perspective or the needs approach

687
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,080
and the low road as the scrappy one uh

688
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
probably because high road begins with

689
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,439
some

690
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,860
some established

691
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,120
[Music]

692
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,360
postulates and

693
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,559
let's say

694
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,480
without going into

695
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,200
a bottom-up approach and beginning with

696
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
the fundamental

697
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,679
uh

698
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,240
principles and then developing

699
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,880
uh the propositions

700
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
uh from there but beginning with

701
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,159
established propositions and then

702
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,120
uh

703
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,799
somehow

704
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,400
chopping it off or

705
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
somehow going into a much more granular

706
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,440
level in terms of its fundamental

707
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,240
constituents

708
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
thank you excellent

709
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,559
i i

710
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,960
find this paragraph to be a very nice

711
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,080
point

712
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,559
which is

713
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,799
we can think of two extreme

714
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,000
ends

715
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,880
of a um kind of like research program or

716
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,720
epistemic ecosystem

717
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,559
one would be

718
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,440
every single neural process

719
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,159
you know acetylcholine synapses

720
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,400
neuro hormones being circulated in this

721
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,640
part every single

722
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
physiological piece could have its own

723
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,679
theory i mean they could have their own

724
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
department they could have their own

725
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,000
university

726
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,080
um and same for every cognitive

727
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
mechanism we could have a separate

728
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
bespoke model

729
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
with no interoperability at all there's

730
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
no reason why it has to

731
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,720
between um attention cognition

732
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,360
perception action social interaction

733
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,480
communication

734
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
anticipation planning

735
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,600
we could have bespoke theories

736
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,240
and somebody might suggest that that is

737
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,399
like preferable in their eye

738
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,640
whether for utility or for aesthetic

739
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
reasons

740
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,159
in their words that would lead to a

741
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,480
proliferation of theories in fields such

742
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,399
as the above

743
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,158
with little hope for their unification

744
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,760
another perspective

745
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,039
is that despite their diverse

746
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,200
manifestations the central aspects of

747
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,679
behavior cognition adaptation

748
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,679
in living organisms are amenable to

749
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,200
coherent explanation from first

750
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
principles

751
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,159
so in other words could we start with

752
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,000
first principles

753
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,960
can explain or explore what those are

754
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,679
but can we start with first principles

755
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,159
and then see

756
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,600
different biological processes

757
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,559
and different cognitive mechanisms

758
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,360
as

759
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,799
being

760
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,440
under a common

761
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,240
umbrella or under a common ontology or

762
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,520
addressable by a shared model

763
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,320
and

764
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,440
then to come back to the question um

765
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,760
because this is a nice

766
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
key point of this uh chapter it's uh

767
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
alluding to roger shank introducing this

768
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
neat versus scruffy distinction

769
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,000
and then as ali suggested this does map

770
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,159
to the high road and the low road

771
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:14,690
which um

772
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,320
[Music]

773
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,120
are mapped out in figure 1.2

774
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,080
and so

775
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,279
the neats

776
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,600
are like the lumpers

777
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,760
they're finding

778
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,279
unity

779
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,080
in

780
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,720
heterogeneity

781
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
and then the scruffies

782
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
are

783
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,919
like

784
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,919
embracing the heterogeneity by focusing

785
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,679
on details that demand dedicated

786
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,960
explanations

787
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
i mean how can we have a model of all

788
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
synapses when the acetylcholine synapses

789
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,880
are so different than the dopamine

790
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,799
synapses and then we'll need a third

791
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,760
model

792
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,919
or a third paper to describe when

793
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,080
there's both acetylcholine and dopamine

794
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,240
at the same synapse so that's like the

795
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
scruffy bottom up

796
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,039
embracing the heterogeneity of nature

797
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
and then the neat

798
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
is coming from the top down

799
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
or from the high road

800
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,120
and finding unification across that

801
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,720
diversification

802
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
brock

803
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
um sorry i just read this whole question

804
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,919
and i don't want to kind of

805
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,320
blow past

806
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,840
um getting into the details of each but

807
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,440
i want to try to maybe

808
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
from where you started there kind of

809
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,279
uh

810
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,679
thread uh

811
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
the needle there too to the end of

812
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,440
what's kind of being asked here is that

813
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,919
well he's he's in the context of these

814
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,039
you know uh bottom up

815
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,559
kind of

816
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,520
less

817
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,600
more explanatory but less meaningful and

818
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,279
the top down kind of more meaningful but

819
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,240
maybe in some cases less explanatory or

820
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
something like this

821
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,559
um

822
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,080
like how

823
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
do

824
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
we look at active inference or where

825
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
does it sit in relation to

826
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,760
all these other

827
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,559
um theories and models of

828
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,399
um

829
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,360
mind body cognition etc

830
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,840
and specifically in in fristen's um

831
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,799
essay uh the desert landscape here um

832
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,919
he's got a quote about fep kind of

833
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,840
subsuming all other

834
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,320
theories as

835
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
not some prediction but just that as

836
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
they kind of take one at a time here

837
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,279
they

838
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,200
have kind of just happened to be

839
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
commensurate and be describable

840
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,399
in some way here by fep and so

841
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,960
is that kind of like

842
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,840
meaningless

843
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,039
i lost you rock i'm not sure if that was

844
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,039
me

845
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,519
hmm

846
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,918
you

847
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,918
hmm

848
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
you

849
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,839
well sorry about this not sure what is

850
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,720
literally happening with my internet

851
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,759
loading okay

852
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,680
yep

853
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,640
uh kind of a source of the confusion for

854
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,839
most people about

855
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,160
what exactly what does active inference

856
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,079
exactly explain or uh and what's the

857
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,839
nature of the explanation there

858
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
can you um

859
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,680
copy paste that

860
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,440
that's a good response and i think

861
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,200
that's

862
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,160
uh

863
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,280
i've appended uh that response to the

864
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
pdf that i've uploaded

865
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
the

866
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,440
course's page

867
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,880
i was just i was just going to say that

868
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,640
that you know the desert landscape being

869
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
left there is

870
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,800
is kind of like a new niche that looks

871
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,000
maybe barren today but if we

872
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,839
continue maybe

873
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,680
it's not so barren maybe there are

874
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,000
adjacent things that are

875
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
that emerge from that niche being

876
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,720
constructed that cultural lens

877
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,880
being used that we look out and see

878
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,240
something different that we weren't

879
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,240
expecting

880
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,640
sorry about my

881
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,720
strange absence

882
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,960
um

883
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,720
bronwyn i think

884
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,919
okay yeah brock

885
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,440
yeah

886
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,280
are you daniel uh john

887
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,839
and you are talking learners

888
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,119
yeah i can't hear i'm gonna read life

889
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,440
in a more simple frame from my my

890
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,280
perspective which is not as advanced as

891
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,000
anyone here in the discussion but it's

892
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,839
but it's more from from

893
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,280
exactly uh the descriptions you've been

894
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,920
or what you've been talking about

895
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,560
has made it a bit more clear in a way

896
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,319
i'm not sure about the high road and the

897
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,240
low road sort of bottom up bottom down

898
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,319
thing but you know there's a lot of

899
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,560
theories about everything

900
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
um

901
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,000
but what was what came through then to

902
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
me was that with fep and active

903
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,599
inference it's a bit

904
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,240
um like it hasn't been fully explored

905
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,640
like it's it's um

906
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,880
that it's something where we're

907
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
actually investigating ourselves so we

908
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,079
don't actually know what we're going to

909
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,520
come up with

910
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,560
um

911
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,280
a bit like the sort of elephant with a

912
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,960
whole lot of people blind people trying

913
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
to work out what the elephant is

914
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,359
and and not actually

915
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,079
getting a grasp of the whole thing

916
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,319
and um

917
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,119
which makes it something that's going to

918
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
that still as someone said still

919
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,359
evolving still actually developing into

920
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,079
whatever it will be eventually

921
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,200
um

922
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
yeah which is which is helpful for my

923
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,280
for my question in terms of

924
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,760
if it's um

925
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
if it's going to

926
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
consume every other theory

927
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,520
um

928
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,680
makes it a little bit too grand and a

929
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,640
little bit

930
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,560
too much i think

931
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
i don't know if i'm making sense but um

932
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,079
it's quite a complex um

933
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,680
point

934
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,319
yeah i i think that that is

935
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,160
um

936
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
that's that is a very common response

937
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,480
and it's still i mean

938
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,079
when you say you're not as advanced as i

939
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,839
mean uh we're just using words we've

940
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,280
learned over the last

941
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,800
two months maybe

942
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,880
some of us um speaking personally um so

943
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,400
but um

944
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,880
you know it's

945
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,800
again there's this question like oh if

946
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,520
it describes everything

947
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,359
or you know and it's unfalsifiable then

948
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,760
what what does that mean you know it's

949
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,000
that's how is that helpful or what is

950
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
the use there i think

951
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
what what you keyed in on this sort of

952
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,440
evolving that we don't know quite yet

953
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,640
and how ali um called attention to that

954
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
response from carl

955
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,520
of a kind of cultural lenses being

956
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,280
developed like that that is

957
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,160
kind of like niche construction that is

958
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,319
that is us figuring out what is the

959
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,319
extent of this niche

960
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,319
where does fap apply where does active

961
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,040
inference apply like really well

962
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,319
yeah and then where does

963
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,240
daniel always uses linear regression

964
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,319
because it's so easy to

965
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,680
grasp at like

966
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
there's many cases where you know maybe

967
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,280
active inference maybe some magical

968
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,880
process is happening but

969
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,720
wow linear regression works really well

970
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,079
you know so

971
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,359
maybe

972
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,599
you know active inference applies but

973
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,520
it's a lot of work and linear regression

974
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,200
works really good right

975
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,640
um so there are certainly

976
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,119
i would expect you know boundaries

977
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,599
to where the pragmatic use like the

978
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
usefulness of it is not

979
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,319
um

980
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,839
it doesn't um continue there's some

981
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,319
drop-off redu yeah so

982
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,119
we don't know what that is precisely yet

983
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,319
i certainly don't i don't know if

984
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,200
somebody else does but

985
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,760
um it's it's a question that's being

986
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,200
explored and i don't yeah i think we

987
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,440
just will figure that out

988
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,040
um

989
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,760
over time through exploring and finding

990
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,160
where that desert you know ends kind of

991
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,960
or

992
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,280
slowly turns back into an oasis for us

993
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,000
to forage in

994
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,640
nice thank you for this um

995
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,319
discussion

996
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,560
i do love the linear regression i mean

997
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,079
imagine if i said really numbers you

998
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:52,960
think you're going to be able to

999
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,880
describe apples and oranges

1000
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,119
with numbers or height and weight i mean

1001
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,119
could two things be more different than

1002
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,800
time and height and weight you really

1003
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,920
think a linear regression is going to

1004
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
cut through that

1005
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,119
um so

1006
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,640
sometimes

1007
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,920
modeling and statistics overall

1008
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,960
can feel like they're encompassing a lot

1009
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
and then especially when there's so much

1010
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,319
philosophy

1011
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,680
and reflection and like relational

1012
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,880
thinking

1013
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,560
in the mix

1014
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,359
it truly can converge on what feels like

1015
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,119
a theory of everything

1016
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,640
and um

1017
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,839
one great video is um from a channel

1018
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,760
called theories of everything

1019
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
by kurt jeimungul

1020
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,560
and um it's with carl first and there's

1021
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,480
several with carl

1022
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,280
and so that is tackled head on

1023
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200
and i don't exactly

1024
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,480
um

1025
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,000
recall

1026
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,280
whether he goes this direction but

1027
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,400
the the the um quintessentially

1028
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,960
fristonian twist

1029
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,440
is yeah we are talking about everything

1030
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,960
everything

1031
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,720
that for you

1032
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,520
is in this sort of like process object

1033
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,040
dialectic

1034
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,359
it is realizing a non-equilibrium steady

1035
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,640
state

1036
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,800
otherwise you wouldn't call it a thing

1037
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,200
so whatever it is that separates that

1038
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,240
thing

1039
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,319
from what is not that thing

1040
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,480
is like a blanket

1041
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,160
and if you're gonna say it's a fuzzy

1042
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,000
blanket well

1043
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,839
there's

1044
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,240
some blanket index and there's a space

1045
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,480
for that discussion as well

1046
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,119
um but when we're talking about things

1047
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,760
as they are

1048
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,720
and or

1049
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,000
as we model them

1050
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,640
we can put them into a framework of

1051
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,200
particular things

1052
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,440
and that's the free energy principle for

1053
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,599
a particular physics

1054
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,280
also known as the bayesian mechanics

1055
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,000
so it it does take a slightly different

1056
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,359
approach

1057
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,079
and then um what will

1058
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,800
active inference converge upon

1059
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,839
or move between these are

1060
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,480
definitely

1061
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,400
open and developing questions

1062
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,160
and and also i i like what like about

1063
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,920
the desert and the oasis because

1064
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,040
the desert is alive as well

1065
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,640
but

1066
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,800
it's it's a reference to this um to

1067
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,240
quine's desert landscape

1068
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,680
um

1069
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,359
and some of that work which has been

1070
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,839
referenced

1071
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,800
so

1072
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,319
very um

1073
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,000
interesting and then there's also like a

1074
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
sort of interpersonal

1075
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,480
approach slash

1076
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,640
like rhetoric

1077
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,079
like is

1078
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,800
this presented as

1079
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,960
are you presenting actin from the high

1080
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,160
road

1081
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,599
well all things need to resist

1082
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,880
dissipation

1083
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
so that's why we're using

1084
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,720
non-equilibrium steady states to

1085
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,599
describe how things exist

1086
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,119
and those kinds of systems have to be

1087
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,960
doing something that either is active

1088
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,480
inference or that we can describe as

1089
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,280
active inference

1090
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,280
and starting with an imperative of

1091
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,960
persistence

1092
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,760
or

1093
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,480
coming from the low road and thinking

1094
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,440
about

1095
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,520
instances

1096
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,839
and how we can model what they're doing

1097
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,119
using bayesian methods

1098
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,800
and many times

1099
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,280
people will find resonance with either

1100
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,319
or both of those roads

1101
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,680
and um

1102
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,920
there's a huge amount of ontology

1103
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,400
mapping

1104
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,559
availabilities

1105
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,559
for people to connect different theories

1106
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,200
to each other

1107
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,920
and also with ali and jakob and ander

1108
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
well next month with the bayesian

1109
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,599
mechanics

1110
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,760
discussion

1111
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,640
there

1112
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,319
we'll we'll tackle this beijing

1113
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,720
mechanics question

1114
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,800
head on

1115
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,160
and um

1116
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,920
so it's just

1117
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,839
i mean year after year and month after

1118
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,040
month there's a lot to

1119
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,599
learn and understand here and sometimes

1120
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
the the philosophers

1121
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,040
um outrun and anticipate

1122
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,480
where things may

1123
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,119
go

1124
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
and then sometimes the writing and the

1125
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,480
genre

1126
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,319
can feel like something has already been

1127
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,760
achieved like well there's already been

1128
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,680
a synthesis of an activism an act of

1129
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,119
inference

1130
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,119
or it can feel like something that is

1131
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,119
being um

1132
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,359
doubted

1133
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,520
is like a conclusive statement that it

1134
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,200
cannot be addressed

1135
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,520
markov blankets cannot address physical

1136
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,280
interfaces

1137
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,720
so

1138
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,399
sometimes lifted from the modeling

1139
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
there can be

1140
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,559
writing and conversation

1141
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,040
that might seem like it is like more or

1142
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,440
less confident about the status or

1143
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,119
future or past

1144
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,359
of this area

1145
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,880
which is like

1146
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,920
what

1147
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,599
motivates this kind of like reading

1148
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,520
between the lines

1149
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
and between the citations

1150
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,280
and also a deflationary

1151
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,599
modeling approach

1152
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,319
where like

1153
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,440
um

1154
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,319
uh

1155
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,079
um we don't know

1156
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,920
you know it's still it's still in

1157
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
evolution as to

1158
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,319
to what to what it does but it sounds

1159
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,640
as if it'll evolve into explaining some

1160
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,559
things but not all things i suppose

1161
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,000
that's where i've got to at the moment

1162
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,720
at this point

1163
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,000
yeah and just

1164
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,240
you know the overriding i'm not sure

1165
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,079
that's

1166
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,640
i wouldn't worry about it overriding

1167
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,920
um theories or you know things that kind

1168
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,720
of already are useful

1169
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,280
um right it's you know

1170
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,440
um

1171
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,440
relativity doesn't make you know

1172
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,400
newton's

1173
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,880
uh laws irrelevant

1174
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,920
right

1175
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,880
so

1176
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,400
um

1177
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,720
where that boundary is specifically is a

1178
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,280
difficult question right now but i think

1179
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,760
the vast majority of theory models of

1180
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
these cognition are not that are you

1181
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,680
know historically been useful are not

1182
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,319
being thrown out they're just being

1183
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,520
we're trying to connect them right so

1184
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,319
i would also just add to that um there's

1185
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,240
like the instrumentalist debate versus

1186
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,839
the realest debate

1187
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,760
and i think that um

1188
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,359
you know the

1189
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,839
act of inference is not necessarily

1190
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,319
to be taken as this is not the way that

1191
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,599
it is

1192
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,559
more that it's a tool that we can use in

1193
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,319
our in our toolbox and so i don't know

1194
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,040
that it invalidates any other theory

1195
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,960
um but it is um

1196
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,720
just another another

1197
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,640
tool in the toolbox right another thing

1198
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,160
that we can use to model things and

1199
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,520
definitely like there are some things

1200
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,160
that active inference or at least as i

1201
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,640
see it it doesn't explain yet like

1202
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,520
um

1203
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,079
like self-sacrificing behavior

1204
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,319
right like like it doesn't necessarily

1205
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,400
explain that yet but maybe if you look

1206
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,640
across different temporal skills that

1207
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,720
that's like possible or like in yeah

1208
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,800
like negative harm and harmful like

1209
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
self-harm so active inference i don't

1210
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,200
think

1211
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,839
um maybe we'll ever successfully model

1212
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,920
that but also like one more thing i just

1213
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,000
want to mention um i don't think anyone

1214
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,599
here or i don't want to speak for

1215
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,160
everyone but i don't think anyone in the

1216
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,520
classroom today feels like they're at

1217
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
the top of that learning curve

1218
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,440
so um like i've been studying active

1219
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,960
inference for like years already and i

1220
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,480
still feel like maybe i'm in the long

1221
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
tail end of the trail on the way up the

1222
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,640
mountain so

1223
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,400
um just just just know that it's

1224
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,040
definitely a process

1225
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,680
yeah i think i've realized that

1226
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,079
i mean i've been reading about it for a

1227
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,319
few years but um

1228
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,520
and in relationship to to to what i do

1229
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,440
um as a i'm an alexander technique

1230
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,559
teacher so

1231
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,640
i'm looking at it from that perspective

1232
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,880
and just seeing how it fits in

1233
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,319
um and so it comes up against other uh

1234
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,680
motor control

1235
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,359
theories and

1236
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,760
you know i mean to say something really

1237
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,960
simple is

1238
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,640
uh the idea that we

1239
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,720
that we don't have motor commands we

1240
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,200
have predictions um

1241
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,880
just the difference between that and if

1242
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,200
i was going to put forward active

1243
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,160
inference to my colleagues then

1244
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,200
then

1245
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,319
how do i

1246
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,839
substantiate that or how do i explain

1247
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,880
that this is

1248
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,960
just a question in my mind i suppose do

1249
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,040
i say that you know the motor command

1250
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,280
thing's out the window and it's all

1251
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,000
uh prediction or do i just say

1252
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,319
this is a possibility this is one idea

1253
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,280
yeah so that's a great point

1254
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,559
great

1255
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,480
point is that daniel

1256
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,000
yeah

1257
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,800
any

1258
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,880
funny i can i can hear you though so

1259
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,480
it's on the recording um anyone else

1260
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,599
have anything asked comments or

1261
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,000
questions

1262
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,000
nice

1263
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,920
it's it's great

1264
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,599
yes go ahead

1265
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,040
yeah

1266
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,359
so i exchanged

1267
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,520
some emails with the thomas parr

1268
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,250
because i went through the book and

1269
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,760
[Music]

1270
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,640
i

1271
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,040
you know i noticed some things that

1272
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,559
may have been

1273
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,000
some typos or some or ask him some some

1274
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,920
questions and so i

1275
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,480
i compiled the document on overleaf with

1276
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,040
these points and questions and it was a

1277
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,559
very kind

1278
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,280
to

1279
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,359
answer and to provide answers and

1280
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,920
about also some clarification of some

1281
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,119
questions

1282
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,280
so

1283
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,079
i'm i sent him an email and asked him if

1284
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,599
he was okay

1285
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,000
to share it with the group

1286
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,640
to share the document with the group and

1287
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,799
he hasn't answered yet but i'm pretty

1288
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,040
sure he will

1289
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,799
consent and then

1290
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,839
you know

1291
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,400
thank you so in this errata section

1292
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
here's where we've um

1293
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,040
have um a handful of uh typos and

1294
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,760
ambiguities and i'll make a subpage

1295
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,520
and um

1296
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,920
you'll have full control

1297
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,680
so just anything you want to do in this

1298
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,160
subpage just do it

1299
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,760
okay um

1300
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,079
all right well

1301
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,079
great time sorry about my strange

1302
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,839
internet just

1303
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,200
disrupts

1304
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,119
beyond belief

1305
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:19,920
but

1306
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,599
we did it

1307
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,359
i'll uh upload this

1308
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,839
soon

1309
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,680
and uh

1310
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,799
enjoy

1311
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,920
reading through chapter two

1312
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,839
please add

1313
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,440
any question

1314
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,799
the most basic and the most confirmatory

1315
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,680
to the most speculative every question

1316
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,359
will be really amazing to see for

1317
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,119
chapter two so

1318
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,799
thanks everyone and see you soon
