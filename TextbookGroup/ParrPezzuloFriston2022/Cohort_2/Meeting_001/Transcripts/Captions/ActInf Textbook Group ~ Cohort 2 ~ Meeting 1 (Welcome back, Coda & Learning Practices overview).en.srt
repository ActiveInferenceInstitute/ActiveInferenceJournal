mention

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,320
gather features and then let's just have

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,000
a few minutes to

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
say hello if we would like

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,039
um

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
on the bottom bar is where you can mute

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,760
yourself or turn off your video so

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,840
that's helpful for people

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,719
um

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,200
on the bottom bar also there's a smiley

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
face where you can

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,559
see a raised hand

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,399
and the hand raise

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,840
which you can also reach with just

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
hitting six

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
is how you have to

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,520
lower it manually but that's how we'll

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,199
know that people want to speak which is

27
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,879
like super helpful

um

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,199
and moving with the arrow keys but

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,440
everyone's figured out if they're here

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,280

i'm in a student role

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,079

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
um

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
well this is the second cohort and

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
there's some people who are

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,720
also

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,199
rather rejoining this first part of the

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,320
book

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
or and or

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
in cohort two

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
uh or in cohort one part two

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
and the meetings are following so if you

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,479
want to stick around or if you're in

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
both that's totally

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
cool i think we're

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,080
obviously just

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
learning by doing with even the

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
structuring

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,919
so

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,680
hopefully people can

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
start to think about active inference

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,919
and how it applies to our processes

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,199
and uh

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
iterate and improve even within

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
cohorts within these next several months

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
together

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
so

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
anyone can also write questions in the

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,380
chat which is the second um

132
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,680
[Music]

133
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
set of button next to the people

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,120
um

135
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
all right

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,400
the first part of this onboarding is

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
going to be

138
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
in the

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
main single source of truth which is

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
posted in the nearby chat

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,919
so this is the document to bookmark and

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,560
use and contribute to as well as any

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
other ways that you want to be

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
contributing um like

145
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
in the institute or just in your own

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
work it's all

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,639
good however you're being engaged and

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,639
this is like our shared information

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,560
environment

150
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
everyone should have edit access but

151
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
this is fine time to check

152
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,199
we're gonna go through some of the pages

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
and how they've

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
been used in the previous cohort it's

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,479
also

156
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,840
extremely

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
rearrangeable so we we wanna and and

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
people can make copies of things and

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,199
we'll go through some features and so on

160
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,759
and just talk about how we'll use these

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
different pages and everything and if

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
anybody like

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
from the previous cohort or

164

who has a question about something you

165
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960

166
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
and like

167
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
there's

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
it's just good to clarify things as we

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
go

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
inference textbook

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
with par pizzulo and fristen

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
some people probably already completed

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
scanning it over or reading it deeply

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
others are

181
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
probably going to go download it

182
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,240
the directory page gives some

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
information about what these different

184
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,639
coda pages are

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
participation rules and guidelines

186
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
this is something to note and also

187
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
provide your feedback on

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,759
which is

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
the synchronous and asynchronous aspects

190
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
of this textbook group which is to say

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
what we discuss in

192
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,960
recorded

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,759
and or active institute synchronous

194
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,400
conversations

195
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,840
and what we put into our shared

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
knowledge repository

197
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
unless it's signaled otherwise can be

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
considered as having this creative

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,039
commons attribution status

200
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,680
which is citation open source with

201
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
attribution so just kind of keep that in

202
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,759
mind and as we

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
explore um learning and

204
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
design decentralized science together

205
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
it will be

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
important to have people's feedback

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
but just wanted to note that because

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
it's kind of an important aspect of

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
doing work and it helps structure what

210
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,879
kinds of contributions you want to be

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,599
making in this shared document where

212
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,599
truly all contributions and questions

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
are really important the most basic

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,319
most speculative which we'll talk about

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
but this is what the status of those

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
contributions are

217
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
and we're here as students and

218
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
individuals

219
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
who are learning and applying active

220
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
inference

221
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,919
especially

222
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
in the second

223
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,919
half of the book

224
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,199
and of course probably in all of our

225
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,280
thinking on active inference or even

226
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
day-to-day work we're very interested in

227
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,560
applying active inference

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,080
also this is a textbook group

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,879
that has a learning in a student

230
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
basis

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
but that's going to be happening in new

232
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,440
ways inside and outside the group and so

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,919
again something to kind of just consider

234
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,719
and

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
give feedback on

236
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
so engagement will look different

237
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,600
for different aspects

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
even

239
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
with planning we still may not know like

240
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
what the synchronous and asynchronous

241
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
availabilities are for

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
your engagement with a textbook and with

243
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
the group

244
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,519
all the meetings are recorded which

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,880
we'll talk about

246
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
but mainly it's going to be about your

247
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
asynchronous

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
engagement with the textbook itself and

249
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,080
some different practices around that

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
also

251
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
anything else that you see as part of

252
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
your

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
learning

254
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
journey here

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
could be contacting people who you're

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
connecting with participating in a

257
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
discord

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
getting involved in some other projects

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
or activities that we have

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
looking more at projects with other

261
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
participants so it it's not all just

262
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,959
about reading and and um

263
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,239
we'll try to unpack that

264
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,640
um

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
you all have access to this coda

266
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
document some pages are are a little bit

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
fixed

268
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
and the ones especially with tables are

269
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
there to be like expanded upon and we'll

270
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,160
get through that

271
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
we um

272
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
have two ongoing cohorts

273
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,079
so if

274
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,600
people would like in the cohort too

275
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,720
which is

276
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
how we are here

277
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
by your

278
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,880
name

279
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,959
um or let us know if you're not added we

280
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
might just need to sync something

281
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
you could note whether you've downloaded

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
the textbook

283
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,040
made time in your calendar

284
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,720
for these synchronous meetings if it

285
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
works or like making time to re-watch it

286
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,360
or just making time to be

287
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
paying attention to this area

288
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
and then if um you're

289
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,360
uh like wanting to share

290
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,079
some blogging or potentially to do some

291
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,040
writing

292
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
around your

293
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,519
work

294
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
and if you want to place a link to your

295
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
site and contact email so people can get

296
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
in touch with you

297
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,920
so you can click those check boxes

298
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
when you've done those steps if you want

299
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,720
to

300
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
so

301
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,440
you're on boarded you have the

302
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
downloaded textbook you're making time

303
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
to participate in different ways

304
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
what is actually going to be the

305
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
participation

306
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
there's many ways to

307
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
learn and people are coming from a lot

308
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
of different backgrounds

309
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
which is

310
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
part of what our

311
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
group is um

312
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,839
about oh sorry i just for the recording

313
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
like wasn't fully sharing my own screen

314
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
um

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,000
but here are the

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,839
learning practices that we've

317
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,959
just sketched and we can add more too

318
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,839
so when you feel like contributing

319
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,320
or paying attention to this

320
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
um

321
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
textbook group

322
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
here are some practices

323
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
that might be interesting

324
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
for you to check out and also comment on

325
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
or improve like what

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
are you doing when you're working with a

327
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
textbook and that's going to range from

328
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,959
peripheral reading and viewing

329
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
could be experiential

330
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,959
it could be

331
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,560
computational

332
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
um especially as we move into the second

333
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,519
half of the textbook where there's a lot

334
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,360
more like model building

335
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
so

336
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
there's also some

337
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,279
uh templates

338
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,680
which you can also in coda

339
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
um like copy out to your own space if

340
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
you'd like

341
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,959
and there's some templates that are

342
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,399
around tracking your practices

343
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
in terms of your allocation of time and

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
like

345
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,360
keeping different um

346
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
accounting of your engagement or your

347
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,320
commitment there's no

348
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
rubrics this can this is an aside

349
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,600
document that only you have

350
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
um other

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
um

352
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
things you can bring in there

353
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,519
uh but that's just to say you can use

354
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,399
some

355
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
practices and accounting

356
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,320
if you like

357
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
just how you see fit

358
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
um and then

359
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
the live meetings themselves

360
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
you can see

361
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,040
the live meetings from cohort one

362
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,000
because they also were under the same

363
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,800
[Music]

364
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,320
open sourced with attribution approach

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
and then here

366
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,959
after this meeting this will be a link

367
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,040
that is rewatchable

368
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
and future meetings will be recorded as

369
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,639
well

370
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
but you can also see some discussions

371
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,800
from earlier cohorts

372
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
so that's a lot of the

373
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,690
like logistics and onboarding

374
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,000
[Music]

375
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,420
we can

376
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,920
[Music]

377
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,839
see it goes through november

378
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,480
that's the rough timing it's variable

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
time commitment

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
of different types

381
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
through

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,480
november

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
strongly influenced by like

384
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
what your availability is and what

385
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
you're

386
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
coming to

387
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
and where you want to go and all of that

388
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,199
what happens along the way

389
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,079
are there any like logistical

390
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,040
questions or advice or things that were

391
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,040
missed

392
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,880
all right um jessica and then anyone

393
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
else and then maybe like alex or

394
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,479
something can mention the overview

395
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440
um yes it's gonna fail so i'm jessica

396
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,839
i'm also a returning um

397
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
student participant for the course um

398
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,240
and i guess i just wanted to add like um

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,399
something that was really

400
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
um really useful last time around was

401
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,959
engaging in the discord with the

402
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
different participants

403
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,199
and kind of like learning from each

404
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,639
other so also like the

405
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,440
live informal chats

406
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,959
and

407
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
you know and kind of

408
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
asking questions of each other in on

409
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
real time and to learn

410
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
so those were like really helpful uh in

411
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
addition to the ones you know asking the

412
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,760
questions in like you know

413
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,639
in the quota and and going over them

414
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,800
here but it was also like that extra

415
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
level of interaction that i really

416
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
enjoyed last time

417
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
so i just wanted to add that part

418
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
thank you

419
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
thanks jessica i added the discord link

420
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
in the chat if anybody is not in it okay

421
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,839
any other like just logistical comments

422
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,839
does anyone want to mention a practice

423
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,399
or

424
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
pattern

425
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,440
that was relevant or they did that they

426
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,519
didn't or didn't expect

427
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
before we look at the pages where a lot

428
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,759
of our shared

429
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
work for people who choose to engage in

430
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
the reading and writing this way

431
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,759
before we even jump into any of it it's

432
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
just anyone have an overview

433
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,120
comment

434
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
about a practice or a way that they felt

435
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
like they were learning a lot

436
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
for me the translation of the math into

437
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,519
english was like mind-blowing

438
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
um and actually like it wasn't so much

439
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,040
the translation as like how much i

440
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,639
learned in the process and how much i

441
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,639
learned about like what i wasn't really

442
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,199
understanding so um i think that that

443
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,000
that was a practice that was like super

444
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,759
instrumental to helping random material

445
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
yeah

446
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,279
and it's not dumb like not even close so

447
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,120
all right so in the next um you know 35

448
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
minutes there's three

449
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,560
big areas to look at that are all part

450
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,839
of the same function of us learning and

451
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,280
collaborating they're also distinct

452
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
though

453
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
there's going to be some tables

454
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,679
which are used as reference in coda

455
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,199
so in coda where you can edit at

456
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
is able to call

457
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,439
like various types of things it can

458
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,199
reference a page

459
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
at which point that becomes a link to

460
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,240
the page

461
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,559
or it can link like

462
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,559
what we'll explore in just a few seconds

463
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,480
it can link a term

464
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,160
like if you want to talk about

465
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
variational free energy

466
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,039
and then that on mouse over can be used

467
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
to look at a lot of things like um

468
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
[Music]

469
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
the definitions and a lot of other

470
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
aspects that we'll continue to have

471
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,000
built so what is it um that these kinds

472
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
of references are often too

473
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
first let's look at the tables and then

474
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,840
into the descriptions of the textbook

475
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
and then the way that the discourse is

476
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,039
range so it's not about like any

477
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,520
importance or precedence it's just

478
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
going through it in this order

479
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,720
um

480
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,000
the ontology is a project

481
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,080
that has been scaffolded at the

482
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
institute since the beginning

483
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
which is the development of term lists

484
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
as well as their translations into

485
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
multiple

486
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
um languages so here's like a public

487
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,760
face this link on the ontology page

488
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
this is a public-facing version where

489
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,880
you can see

490
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
definitions

491
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
and then also the translation

492
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
into these current languages so if

493
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
anyone

494
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
has a language also that they are not

495
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,880
seeing here that they're familiar with

496
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
that is

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,559
there's 74 core terms

498
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,679
and it can be an awesome contribution

499
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
these ontology terms

500
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
allow us to do a lot of things like

501
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
again encoder

502
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,039
referencing when we're using a term

503
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,400
specifically

504
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
which is going to facilitate

505
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
like cross-linking

506
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
as well as translation and a lot of

507
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,919
other aspects

508
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
um so we'll see how the ontology comes

509
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,720
into play in the in the sections above

510
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
that are more about the book but these

511
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,919
are kind of static tables for

512
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,240
semi-static tables that will be used in

513
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
a lot of other parts above

514
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,440
the live streams

515
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
are

516
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,880
a table of live streams

517
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,960
the live stream series itself is paper

518
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,000
driven

519
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
and so if you're curious about a given

520
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
topic like communication

521
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,760
you may find that there are several

522
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,080
live streams and relevant papers there

523
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,799
inactive inference research we have a

524
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
table of some citations and this is

525
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
work from some knowledge engineering

526
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
projects that are also

527
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
always in progress in an area for people

528
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,360
to be involved in

529
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,039
with ways of

530
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,360
aggregating resources

531
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,039
and

532
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,200
bringing their accessibility

533
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
into working documents like this

534
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,039
um

535
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
and then there's just a list that's

536
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,159
referenced elsewhere so those are kind

537
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,880
of the static tables which are just some

538
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
live streams that people may enjoy or

539
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
are often brought up to contextualize

540
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,760
other papers that we might mention

541
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
um

542
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,799
and then the ontology table

543
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
the ontology structures a lot of the

544
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,320
technical discussions in the active

545
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
inference

546
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
field

547
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,559
first the textbook and then the

548
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,320
discourse that we'll have more on the

549
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,440
textbook this section textbook

550
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,400
is

551
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
the textbook is open source

552
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
hey gsrp do you have a

553
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
question

554
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,640
hi no i just i just managed to connect

555
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
right now i'm not very familiar with the

556
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
interface

557
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,159
cool welcome thank you

558
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,039
um the textbook section itself

559
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,039
is going to contain many

560
00:20:59,039 --> 00:20:59,290
um

561
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,880
[Music]

562
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,600
tables and the table is going to be of

563
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
the type that is described in the page

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,559
so you can peruse these but

565
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,039
they're used for multiple reasons first

566
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
it's all enabled because the textbook is

567
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,600
open source

568
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
what

569
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,400
the um

570
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,520
kind of aliquoting of the textbook into

571
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
these

572
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,039
formats

573
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,880
which is a lot of the work that was done

574
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,559
in the first iteration of the first part

575
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,919
for the first five chapters then we'll

576
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,320
do that for the second

577
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,799
having a field that's callable as like

578
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,520
equation 2.1 means that anywhere you can

579
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,400
just do at equation 2.1

580
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
and then okay okay that's what 2.1 looks

581
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,480
like

582
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
and so

583
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
these can also be tagged

584
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
and these are contributions that are

585
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
incredibly valuable for people to make

586
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
if they feel

587
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
moved to want to do these types of

588
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
contributions

589
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
so that like when people

590
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
type in a term

591
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
like bayesian

592
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
a bunch of equations that are relevant

593
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,280
come up

594
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
then um

595
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,600
blue maybe do you want to describe

596
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
um what these

597
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,320
descriptions are of the equations

598
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,960
if you're there

599
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,559
okay

600
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,520
these

601
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
descriptions of you or ali do you want

602
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
to describe

603
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
sorry i was muted and i'm driving um

604
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
okay okay

605
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
yeah

606
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
i can uh describe really quickly they

607
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
are um the descriptions are like

608
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,440
literally how

609
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
you would read the math equation so if

610
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,280
you like

611
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
are you know you read like y equals mx

612
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,360
plus b this is like you know the um

613
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,280
y-intercept is equal to the slope times

614
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
the x-intercept plus

615
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,039
the um or sorry the y-coordinate equals

616
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
the slope times the x-coordinate plus

617
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,679
the y or y-intercept right so it's like

618
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,760
literally how you would read

619
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,640
the equations in active inference using

620
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
like english words for the terms that

621
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,039
they represent

622
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,440
thank you blue and those terms because

623
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,960
they're referencing

624
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
terms in the active inference ontology

625
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
this is going to help contextualize the

626
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
equation it's not the whole story on

627
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,919
equations there's a ton of discourse

628
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,120
below

629
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
and then when we get to questions in our

630
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
discourse

631
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
you can ask open questions at reference

632
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,120
or are stimulated by seeing formulas so

633
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
as hopefully becomes

634
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,159
clear

635
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,440
all math backgrounds and preferences are

636
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,840
welcome and everybody should be able to

637
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,120
find uh

638
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
meaning

639
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,679
and

640
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,279
again for the people who feel like doing

641
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,600
these kinds of annotations

642
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,520
or work like for example jakub

643
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
who showed some derivations and it was

644
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
like

645
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
oh the first one goes to the second and

646
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,240
the first one goes to the third

647
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
but the second one doesn't go to the

648
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
third

649
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,640
okay

650
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
well that's a different understanding

651
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,360
even without the equation of

652
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,600
how all of these terms which are natural

653
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
everyday terms

654
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
are linked to the formalisms because

655
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
the formalisms are

656
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
infinite journey

657
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,600
with math and everything

658
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
so that's why we're always looking to

659
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
increase the accessibility of what is

660
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
being related

661
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,640
so that in the natural language use

662
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,240
and in the

663
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
settings where we're wanting to apply

664
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,760
active inference we can interact with

665
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,360
these things

666
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
grounded in the formalisms but using

667
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
regular ways of um

668
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,679
communicating it's worth it because the

669
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
equations are going to be

670
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,400
peppered in the book as well as

671
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,200
technical and difficult concepts or big

672
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
questions that aren't equations so the

673
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,120
difficulty is not purely

674
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,200
analytical

675
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,440
it's also just um

676
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
everybody will have areas they're like

677
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,799
familiar with and unfamiliar with

678
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,320
okay figures is very similar the figure

679
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,919
information on the figure and then the

680
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,279
image is posted

681
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,400
so that

682
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
figure 2.2 again it can always be

683
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
clicked

684
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,720
so especially as these tables gain

685
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,799
completeness

686
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,640
and also we can even copy the whole text

687
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
of the book

688
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,480
to github or to um

689
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,320
pages

690
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
so we can make and this is all on the

691
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,640
road of developing interfaces for

692
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
learning and applying active inference

693
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
boxes and tables again similar to

694
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,360
figures

695
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,159
it just has images and it allows you to

696
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:50,960
call

697
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,799
box 2.1 okay that was what box 2.1 was

698
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,200
code so this is going to come into play

699
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,279
especially for people who have this

700
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,840
background or would like to learn more

701
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,799
and also in the second

702
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,480
half of the book

703
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,799
which is about model building

704
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,520
and here we'll be developing i know ali

705
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,480
and brock and jakob

706
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
many people are interested in this kind

707
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,919
of notebook driven development

708
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,360
so again if somebody is familiar with

709
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
like git and notebook

710
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,559
development and hopefully there will be

711
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,640
many opportunities there

712
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
um in the chapters these are just uh

713
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,080
this is a filtered view by chapter of

714
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
the questions asked regarding that

715
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,360
chapter

716
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,080
if somebody wants to really focus on one

717
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
section

718
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,919
and also these are editable pages um or

719
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
comment or if they're not

720
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
where you can just add

721
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
just anything you want on the chapters

722
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
these are the sections of the book

723
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,120
there's ten chapters and there's three

724
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,559
appendices

725
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,559
chapters one through five constitute

726
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,640
like an epistemic learning component of

727
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
the of the book

728
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,720
and then chapters six through ten

729
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,440
are

730
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,679
about building models

731
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
and about applying

732
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,840
still perhaps more theoretical than some

733
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
would imagine applying to mean but

734
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,159
relative to the first five it begins to

735
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,440
get applied

736
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,760
so these are just

737
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
sections of the book

738
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,159
there are the equations in a way that

739
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,520
they're going to be referenceable in the

740
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
discourse same for the figures boxes and

741
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
tables and code is something that people

742
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,360
can be developing more

743
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
especially in the second part of the

744
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
book

745
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,600
all right now to the

746
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,279
discourse itself

747
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,960
and the collapsing in the coda can start

748
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,480
helping a lot

749
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,919
so

750
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,480
just to go over these pages

751
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,399
so a really important page especially

752
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,440
for the live meetings is the questions

753
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,840
so this questions page is going to be

754
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,399
all the questions that have been asked

755
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,880
however you can also go into cohort 2

756
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,480
questions

757
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
to develop your own cohort specific so

758
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,480
it's all referenceable like the

759
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,720
underlying questions are all retained so

760
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,360
if you don't want to like

761
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
have your priors updated by what

762
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
previous people have asked then

763
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,799
don't look

764
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,840
however if you want to

765
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,720
see

766
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,559
and even improve

767
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,720
the kinds of questions and

768
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,840
discourse

769
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
and the way that the live meetings work

770
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,360
is that

771
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,080
the

772
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
questions that are for that week's topic

773
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,159
we will look at like we'll go okay

774
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,240
chapter one we're discussing today

775
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
this one has the most up

776
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,360
votes

777
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,320
and then we'll just try to go

778
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,840
through that list

779
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,440
we're not going to address every

780
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,120
possible one to the possible most

781
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
possible especially written level of

782
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,799
detail

783
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,520
however before any time including after

784
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,360
it's been discussed one time people can

785
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
continue to come back and give thoughts

786
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,559
and discourse

787
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,640
one thing about the book structurally is

788
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,080
there aren't any

789
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,720
questions or

790
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
cases provided

791
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
so there's a large opportunity to

792
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,520
develop

793
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
really quality and interesting questions

794
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,240
from

795
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,159
the very very

796
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,360
basics

797
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,159
of

798
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
a chapter's gist or context or anything

799
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
to really just open-ended questions

800
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,360
where there isn't even an answer per se

801
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,120
just kind of people

802
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,039
can just work on some unsolvable problem

803
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,279
or solve a problem or something

804
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,279
just at the end of chapter one because

805
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
kind of why not

806
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,760
um

807
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,279
so we go through the interesting ones

808
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,120
and clicking on this

809
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
kind of an icon in a coded table will

810
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
open up that

811
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,039
where it's easier instead of having a

812
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,640
text box that just becomes out of

813
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,720
control this is like

814
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,120
allowing a lot of discussion

815
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
people are bringing in different

816
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,520
resources

817
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,159
we can ask questions about using terms

818
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,919
in the ontology

819
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,679
all these kinds of things again the

820
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,200
questions can be

821
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,760
um and also the questions can um

822
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,240
reference parts of the book so oh this

823
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,080
is about chapter one and figure 1.2

824
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,399
okay

825
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,440
so that is how we'll do the live

826
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,399
meetings

827
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,080
and so

828
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,880
adding as many questions

829
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,399
as you would like

830
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,000
is great

831
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,320
just truly if whether it's something you

832
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,880
think is very simple and you just want

833
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,919
to

834
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,080
add it as something that somebody could

835
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,679
be asked

836
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,840
or something that is like okay just

837
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,279
checking

838
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,559
what is the difference between this and

839
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,240
that

840
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,120
that's a great or it can be open-ended

841
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,440
or it can be anything that you're

842
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
asking

843
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,360
and then we'll just try to discuss them

844
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,320
and continue to develop the discourse

845
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,519
on them so that is because so just it's

846
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,720
worth spending a lot of time on because

847
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
the question structure the live meetings

848
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,279
which is just the tip of the iceberg

849
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,799
hopefully you would get a lot just from

850
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,960
one hour per week

851
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
of the discussions and seeing how people

852
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,039
have updated the coda

853
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,399
and their own notes

854
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,679
however

855
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,240
arguably you'll be developing a lot more

856
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,200
if you're also

857
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,200
asking questions and

858
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,799
writing them down to yourself or at

859
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,720
least adding some here so that's the

860
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,880
questions aspect

861
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,279
um ideas and insights don't have to be

862
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,960
framed as questions but people can just

863
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,480
add

864
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,559
anything that they were thinking or

865
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,430
reflecting on

866
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,600
[Music]

867
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,840
just

868
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,679
like different ideas and insights from

869
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,240
the book if they'd like

870
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
um then we have

871
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,080
several other aspects

872
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,159
so next is the math learning group which

873
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,600
was a great

874
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
um innovation by several the

875
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,960
participants here who are really active

876
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,840
so

877
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
they know who they are and they all like

878
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,720
helped

879
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,440
steward and template

880
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,279
a really

881
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,200
accessible and inclusive approach to

882
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,279
math discussions and

883
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:15,610
um

884
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,200
[Music]

885
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
this is an area for people on any

886
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,240
side of some perceived math

887
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
comprehension

888
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
situation they can be in this

889
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,480
group

890
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
and we'll set

891
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
sometimes amongst the people who want to

892
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,080
commit to a certain set of times

893
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
but it does it doesn't have to be

894
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,039
recorded it's

895
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,330
um

896
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,880
[Music]

897
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,960
it was not previously

898
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,399
and here are just several pages within

899
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,760
the math learning group which is really

900
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
everyone but that was kind of like the

901
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
joke

902
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
first there are several overviews

903
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,640
written

904
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
that are

905
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,919
there was one table update so here if

906
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,600
you see a strange sign these can be

907
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,880
fixed it's just like okay you just have

908
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
to replace it with that word but it was

909
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,559
a previous table is being referenced but

910
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,880
there's a few little cases like that

911
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,679
um

912
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,640
these

913
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,559
math overviews were

914
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,360
can be collaboratively improved to be

915
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,080
like so they introduced section

916
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,720
2.2 this equation because it's going to

917
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
show this just try to walk through some

918
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,000
of you have overviews of the book with

919
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,880
the technical eye

920
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,360
there are math learning resources

921
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
that are just describing some of the

922
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,720
resources people have found relevant for

923
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,919
learning a lot of the background

924
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,080
materials which have been named

925
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,360
differently in different um

926
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,399
settings and there's also a lot of

927
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,000
change even in the fundamentals of

928
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,360
active inference and free energy

929
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
principle recently

930
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,399
so

931
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,000
it's not like an

932
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,330
um

933
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,600
[Music]

934
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,760
absolute or total claim about what the

935
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,720
bases or backgrounds are that being said

936
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,960
certain areas like

937
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
linear algebra and stochastic processes

938
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,519
and statistics

939
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,039
can be

940
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,360
helpful

941
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
anyone else can add more of course but

942
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,880
i'm just mentioning a few areas and what

943
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,639
the appendices are

944
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,079
mentioning

945
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,520
notation

946
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,399
here

947
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,839
is connecting

948
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,839
some of the natural language ontology

949
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,800
terms

950
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,879
to the notation used

951
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,599
in discrete time active inference and

952
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,159
continuous time active inference

953
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,399
so that we can then

954
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,079
kind of keep some of the formalisms in

955
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,599
mind and get familiar with some of the

956
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,119
notation

957
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,040
as we're talking about affordances or

958
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,399
observations

959
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,239
because that is the

960
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,800
structure of

961
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,199
the relationship of the ontology

962
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,960
also not in its

963
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,239
final form

964
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,239
but at least there is a specific thing

965
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
here's some math learning questions so

966
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,079
it's just a separate section

967
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,000
for questions if people don't want to

968
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,359
put them in the main table but of course

969
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,320
math questions again of the most

970
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
confirmatory to the most difficult are

971
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,040
also welcome in the questions table but

972
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,920
these are some questions about

973
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,079
conversations to have

974
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,520
around

975
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
learning and approaching the math

976
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,760
and

977
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,839
there'll be some experimentation with um

978
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,720
math typewriting

979
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,640
um

980
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,520
okay

981
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,000
i'll um mention the other sections

982
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,640
before project ideas

983
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,960
resources so here's some resources that

984
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
people have found are as relevant also

985
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
searchable

986
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,320
here are some uh here's a feedback form

987
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,119
which we'll update later in the cohort

988
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,200
and a link for people who want to join a

989
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,280
future cohort

990
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,880
and then here's just

991
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,839
some

992
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,119
ideation

993
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,480
on what you would tell future

994
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,320
participants

995
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
different written feedback

996
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,119
different ideas people have had

997
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,359
about how to be involved in structuring

998
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
the textbook group differently and

999
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
better which

1000
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,530
should and will happen

1001
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,119
[Music]

1002
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,599
in the coming cohorts

1003
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,240
and then errata is uh just like some

1004
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,280
random stuff random thoughts people have

1005
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,000
and a few little typos or uncertainties

1006
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,359
in the book

1007
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,040
those kinds of

1008
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,359
things

1009
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,040
so just to kind of return to the

1010
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,680
overview and then we can have the rest

1011
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,000
of the time with any like discussions or

1012
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
thoughts people are having

1013
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
we are

1014
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,880
finishing

1015
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,960
our

1016
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,800
onboarding

1017
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,280
for this cohort 2

1018
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,960
and then

1019
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
we're going to take two

1020
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,960
weeks per chapter and we're going to go

1021
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,560
through the first five chapters

1022
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,119
the chapters are not extremely extremely

1023
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,000
long in terms of page

1024
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
but

1025
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,359
there will be paragraphs where they're

1026
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,640
just

1027
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,520
inscrutable or

1028
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,839
like you could also think about them for

1029
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,359
a long time

1030
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,520
and so

1031
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,040
that's where the practices come into

1032
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,279
play

1033
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,880
to whatever extent is possible

1034
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,880
having at least read through if or or

1035
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,280
listened if you prefer audio form

1036
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,920
to the chapter

1037
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,760
would be the best

1038
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,560
before a session on that chapter

1039
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
like ideally these are not motivating

1040
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
you to then check out chapter one

1041
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
it's the most helpful to have read the

1042
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,640
section before

1043
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,320
chapter one is

1044
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,160
a very overview

1045
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
so it will spur many questions and it's

1046
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,480
non-technical and then all the equations

1047
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,839
and so on start beginning in chapter two

1048
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,640
um

1049
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,520
so

1050
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
try to paste things so that you are

1051
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,200
prepared for the discussion at least

1052
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,800
having

1053
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
read or listened

1054
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
to those pages

1055
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,040
and just looked at what the figures were

1056
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,079
and ideally also having contributed some

1057
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,640
questions or and even some discourse on

1058
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
the questions or thoughts on it so that

1059
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,920
in the live meeting it's not like okay

1060
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,640
here we've read the question

1061
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
who has a thought on it it could be like

1062
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,079
well here's two

1063
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,240
perspectives people have shared

1064
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,760
is there any other

1065
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,359
thought on how that could happen

1066
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,520
so well in chapter one which again is

1067
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,160
very overview

1068
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,000
styled

1069
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,240
these will be pretty

1070
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,079
open

1071
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,359
discussions

1072
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,560
about the context of active inference

1073
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,800
maybe even ongoing changes in active

1074
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
inference

1075
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
one overall note is

1076
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,040
this mod this textbook

1077
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,400
there's of course many ways to think

1078
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,240
about it but it's like describing the

1079
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,440
kernel

1080
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,599
of

1081
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,040
a framework

1082
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,440
which is the action perception loop

1083
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,079
and some formalisms and approaches

1084
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,920
towards formalisms for the action

1085
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,160
perception loop

1086
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
the papers

1087
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,960
conferences literature at a very rapid

1088
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,079
pace

1089
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,240
is elaborating in a ton of directions

1090
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
which actually i will leave to ali to

1091
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,359
describe because i think

1092
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,560
you'll have a lot to say all this

1093
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,040
well yeah uh actually on resources page

1094
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,880
uh i've accurate curated

1095
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
a collection of 17

1096
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,920
papers

1097
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
uh and i've put them roughly in the

1098
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,680
order of increasing technicalities

1099
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,200
and

1100
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,599
i think these papers might come in handy

1101
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,280
as we go through the textbook because

1102
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,640
i mean the textbook is

1103
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,400
especially some chapters are really

1104
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,560
dense and will definitely need some

1105
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,640
additional resources

1106
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,680
so

1107
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,560
feel free to add any other

1108
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,960
papers or articles articles you came

1109
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,880
across or reorder them in any way

1110
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,800
you see fit but yeah this is uh

1111
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,640
this page might

1112
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,160
[Music]

1113
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
be useful uh

1114
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,640
for some people if they want to

1115
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
gain a little bit more deeper

1116
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,560
understanding in terms of

1117
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,640
the essential concepts and so on

1118
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,200
thanks

1119
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,480
yes jessica

1120
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,680
um yeah i guess i wanted to build up on

1121
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
at least um

1122
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
comment because i found like there were

1123
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
a lot of like the papers that he uh

1124
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,839
suggested that were very helpful like

1125
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,160
i'm a pretty much beginner and in this

1126
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,800
space and also with a lot of the math

1127
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,040
and and a lot of the papers that he

1128
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,800
added and

1129
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,560
which was sort of like straddling

1130
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,599
between so like statistics and also um

1131
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,280
what the book and is talking about

1132
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,400
on

1133
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,960
is it i think just i guess to like back

1134
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,040
up a little bit like one of the

1135
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,280
challenges that i found is like in the

1136
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,520
textbook it's frame a lot of the

1137
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,359
statistical material and some of the

1138
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,960
math is framed

1139
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,640
from the active inference obviously and

1140
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,160
approach

1141
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,200
and the link back to some of the basics

1142
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,760
in statistics might be lost

1143
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,839
and there were like some references that

1144
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,359
i

1145
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,440
suggested and mentioned that allowed me

1146
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,119
to be able to

1147
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,440
make the connections to understand like

1148
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,119
okay so

1149
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,160
inactive inference one is looking at

1150
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
this term that's normally used in

1151
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,359
statistic

1152
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,000
in this other way this is how

1153
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,880
you know

1154
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,359
it connects and and be able to learn a

1155
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,680
little bit of the foundation for that

1156
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,960
and then be able to um

1157
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,599
make the transition to how it's used in

1158
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,240
an active inference and

1159
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,680
framework or more than this approach and

1160
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,839
so yeah so that's what i wanted to like

1161
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
build up because they were like you know

1162
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,240
very like useful on connection to kind

1163
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,560
of go from more foundational

1164
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,240
aspect to then connecting it to active

1165
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,880
inference and how they are applied

1166
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,680
in this sense

1167
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,720
thank you jessica

1168
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,800
um

1169
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,720
[Music]

1170
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
yeah i i

1171
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,319
think it's

1172
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,240
great that the math group opened up a

1173
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,760
lot of that

1174
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,680
discussion in space

1175
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,760
because this is a textbook and to kind

1176
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,520
of return to that idea of it being a

1177
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,720
kernel

1178
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,599
this is going to be focusing on

1179
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,839
a

1180
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,359
didactic

1181
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,480
slash exemplar

1182
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,920
single agent

1183
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,200
case

1184
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,640
one entity

1185
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,760
involved in an action perception loop

1186
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
and it's going to describe

1187
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,480
that process

1188
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,359
it also doesn't describe the um every

1189
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,599
aspect from every possible perspective

1190
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,560
it's a short book overall

1191
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,880
and the step by step

1192
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,119
which is probably linked in all these

1193
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
the step-by-step guide

1194
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,319
for example is also almost book length

1195
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,119
you'll find other almost book length

1196
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,119
approaches to learning

1197
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,880
including ones that take very different

1198
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,800
approaches

1199
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
like the path that they take in a

1200
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,839
step-by-step guide with even some of the

1201
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,760
same authors is not the same as the

1202
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,880
textbook

1203
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,760
and the textbook structure is not

1204
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,880
without

1205
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,599
uncertainties and so on there's like

1206
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,319
from the fundamental mathematical

1207
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,160
to especially chapter five when the

1208
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,599
neuroscience is going to get connected

1209
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,079
broader discussions around systems and

1210
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,400
complexity and cybernetics control

1211
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,800
theory

1212
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,480
philosophy and especially the

1213
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,839
introduction

1214
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,720
of the 4e etc embedded extended

1215
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,839
things like nested communicating

1216
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,839
cyber physical systems

1217
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,040
are not

1218
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,760
going to be in the middle of chapter two

1219
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,040
except potentially by just mention

1220
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,760
so

1221
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,160
the research has a huge amount of these

1222
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,359
cases

1223
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,280
and like ramifications of active

1224
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
inference

1225
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,200
which often you'll see with an adjective

1226
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,520
before like deep active inference now

1227
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,119
it's considering something about

1228
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,200
temporal depth or something

1229
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,560
um

1230
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
so again it's all say the textbook is a

1231
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,880
lot

1232
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,560
and yet there's more

1233
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,040
especially in application

1234
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,880
so that again just returns us to the

1235
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
practices and thinking about this as

1236
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,640
learning the kernel of active inference

1237
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,480
or a kernel

1238
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,520
or a

1239
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,800
distilled representation by some of the

1240
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,160
people who have been working in this

1241
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,760
area

1242
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,119
for a long time

1243
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,440
like carl fristen and those who are

1244
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,480
bringing

1245
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,839
a sort of

1246
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,800
computational

1247
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,000
view

1248
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,880
that and physics-based view

1249
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,760
which is mainly explored

1250
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,070
in

1251
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,599
[Music]

1252
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,599
recent literature but also not in the

1253
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,119
textbook

1254
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,560
anyone could have more thoughts on that

1255
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,760
but

1256
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,599
or just general thoughts on the

1257
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,200
practices or

1258
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,319
the

1259
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,480
the

1260
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,839
way to approach the textbook

1261
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,880
even though published in march

1262
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,800
or april this year

1263
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,119
still

1264
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,359
it feels like a lot has

1265
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,839
changed

1266
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,319
in inactive inference or what do people

1267
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,000
think what is the way to approach the

1268
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
textbook

1269
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,920
ali and then anyone else

1270
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
well uh just one thing that i think um

1271
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,000
might be helpful to keep in mind is that

1272
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,839
is that um

1273
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,119
as uh if people want to go through the

1274
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,079
the additional resources and

1275
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,640
the other papers in the literature

1276
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,880
uh well uh it would be helpful to keep

1277
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,599
in mind that the notations used in the

1278
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,720
book

1279
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,119
is mostly different from most of the

1280
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,960
notations used in the rest of the

1281
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,520
literature so uh this might be confusing

1282
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,680
at the initial stages so

1283
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,400
um yeah that's one caveat

1284
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,119
that i wanted to mention

1285
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,800
thanks for mentioning it um it's one

1286
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,119
reason why we have this

1287
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,079
language ontology driven approach

1288
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,079
because we'll be able to make columns

1289
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,160
for different papers this is written

1290
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,440
down elsewhere i just want to note that

1291
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
for people who like do want to really

1292
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,800
parse through a paper

1293
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,520
where there is alignment

1294
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,480
in what the papers are discussing

1295
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,560
or or disagreement or ambiguity or all

1296
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,680
the above

1297
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,960
but is about the terms and the concepts

1298
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,559
which is also what connects the

1299
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,359
formalisms whether the math analytical

1300
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,040
equation formalisms

1301
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,880
or the computational

1302
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,520
coding implementations

1303
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,240
whatever formalisms are being used

1304
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,680
when they're being discussed outside of

1305
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,359
formalisms it's with

1306
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,440
these kinds of terms

1307
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,200
so decision making and policy selection

1308
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,920
affordances capacities for action

1309
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,359
and then that's represented a certain

1310
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,839
way in equations

1311
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,119
maybe as a bold letter or maybe as

1312
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,760
a vector or there's just that is where

1313
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,280
there's

1314
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,960
heterogeneity

1315
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,640
is the ways that

1316
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,650
certain um

1317
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,280
[Music]

1318
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,720
terms are

1319
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,240
represented because people are coming at

1320
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,240
this for many threads which we'll be

1321
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,599
learning about

1322
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,240
but in um statistics maybe they're used

1323
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,640
to talking about like y is a predictor

1324
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,000
of x

1325
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,160
but then in

1326
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,680
bayesian models of perception and

1327
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,400
cognition maybe o is used for

1328
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,000
observation and s is for a hidden state

1329
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
but

1330
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,680
that might be an analogous situation

1331
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,599
[Music]

1332
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,839
in the

1333
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,480
actual topics and how they're related

1334
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,359
and

1335
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:37,680
um

1336
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,359
[Music]

1337
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,599
yeah any other

1338
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,160
thoughts on this

1339
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,480
oh the last section which of here is the

1340
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,200
project ideas

1341
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,440
jessica or anyone

1342
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,200
want to give an overview on the project

1343
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,598
ideas

1344
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,760
um yes um

1345
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,480
i guess like in general the idea is

1346
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,720
if you have on

1347
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,240
a specific

1348
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,160
way that you want to

1349
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,800
practice like learning by doing on

1350
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
active inference or like a project in

1351
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,119
mind and

1352
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,280
to share it and with the community to

1353
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,119
see if there's all the other people who

1354
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,359
are interested in

1355
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,960
joining you and exploring it in that um

1356
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,079
manner

1357
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,839
and and so yeah so you share the idea um

1358
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,079
you put in your name and so that other

1359
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,800
people can contact you on and also tap

1360
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,319
themselves on

1361
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,319
saying that they're interested

1362
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,480
and and then you know you can also like

1363
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,720
organize yourself and to

1364
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,040
create like a separate um

1365
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,000
study group or like you know project

1366
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,079
and group and to do this um together and

1367
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,079
then there's already like some um

1368
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,720
projects idea that already like emotion

1369
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
and that you can also learn by doing so

1370
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,119
like black friends and which is also

1371
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,720
part like the

1372
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,960
institute itself and it's a project but

1373
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,760
then they're all the ones that are also

1374
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,520
like more independent from all the

1375
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
previous um

1376
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,680
participants in the

1377
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,000
you know study group on

1378
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,280
yeah so it's very very informal and

1379
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,559
just you know post a flag and

1380
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,880
and see

1381
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,119
you know what momentum generates and you

1382
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,880
know what feedback you get out of it

1383
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,119
yeah

1384
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,640
thank you jessica yeah there's just

1385
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,160
people can continue to add and it looks

1386
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,640
like some people even are adding things

1387
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,400
but it ranges from

1388
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,079
audio recordings of the book

1389
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,200
going into various aspects of the rigor

1390
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,960
and accessibility of the textbook

1391
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,079
uh actin foundations course

1392
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,079
which i know brock and ali have

1393
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,760
worked on and

1394
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,040
other types of textbook enrichment

1395
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,520
um people interested in domain specific

1396
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,599
cases many of which

1397
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,880
we can scaffold really well in active

1398
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,040
block friends

1399
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,720
all the meetings

1400
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,480
this meeting is in gather so we can be a

1401
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,319
little bit more like face to face also

1402
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,599
potentially use

1403
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,720
breakouts spatially but also be not

1404
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,240
related to the discord if people don't

1405
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,839
want to be that way it's not that it

1406
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,319
always maybe we can

1407
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,079
you know see how things evolve in

1408
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,400
platforms but we're here so that we can

1409
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,000
have a really focal

1410
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,280
study

1411
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,599
and connection time

1412
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,000
and the project meetings are in our

1413
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,079
discord

1414
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,839
those or or they can be arranged as

1415
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,599
people see fit but by default in the

1416
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,359
discord like for active block for

1417
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,119
instance for others

1418
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,040
and that helps provide some visibility

1419
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,559
for your project even if someone's not

1420
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,559
in the textbook group

1421
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,240
and um

1422
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,920
[Music]

1423
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,800
as the months go by hopefully people see

1424
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,960
a lot of ways to

1425
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,599
want to apply active inference the book

1426
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,520
will make several

1427
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,880
comments to that effect too

1428
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,280
um

1429
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,569
[Music]

1430
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,200
does anyone have any other comments

1431
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,839
otherwise we'll

1432
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,359
end this first discussion

1433
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,359
neil and then anyone else

1434
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,440
yeah i mean this all looks absolutely

1435
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,079
fantastic i was just wondering

1436
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,720
what is it that acting

1437
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,800
uh what's the objective

1438
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,359
for the acting group what are you trying

1439
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,559
to

1440
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,680
get out of this and what might we

1441
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,640
help

1442
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,440
to achieve that

1443
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,359
well appreciate that i hope we can

1444
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,400
find out

1445
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
and co-create how

1446
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,839
but

1447
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,920
in general our

1448
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,319
mission at the institute is to address

1449
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,240
education and research

1450
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,599
so those are the two sections of the

1451
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,040
textbook

1452
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,680
and these types of groups and people's

1453
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,720
engagement in them and the projects

1454
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,319
and

1455
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,160
other facilitations of the institute as

1456
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,000
they see relevance

1457
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,200
in a changing ecosystem they're all

1458
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,640
helpful

1459
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,520
um rowan

1460
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,960
uh yes i just wanted it's a very simple

1461
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,400
question

1462
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,359
in regards to the questions for the

1463
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,040
upcoming chapters

1464
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,960
do we are we able to put those questions

1465
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,800
in before the meeting is that is that

1466
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,160
the aim so

1467
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,079
as i'm reading the chapter and i've got

1468
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,000
a question i can pop it in there and

1469
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,640
then that'll be answered during the

1470
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,000
session

1471
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,880
yes

1472
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,720
so you could just like click in which

1473
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,640
chapter you want the question to be in

1474
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,720
and then just hit enter

1475
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,119
dot dot okay new question

1476
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,720
dot dot and then

1477
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,450
you can um

1478
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,720
[Music]

1479
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,960
add if you want in this field you can

1480
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,520
use the at and say okay at

1481
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,079
equation 2.1

1482
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,720
and then the question could be like

1483
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,280
i saw equation one dot dot but yes

1484
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,800
adding them before

1485
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,839
will make those discussions

1486
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,960
really um

1487
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,319
rich and

1488
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,760
have some starting places for the

1489
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,880
discussion and then if someone can't

1490
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,680
make the discussion that's also fine

1491
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,880
because then their questions will be

1492
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,920
addressed

1493
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,920
and yeah be given visibility so we can

1494
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,400
continue to address it

1495
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,079
okay

1496
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,040
good thank you

1497
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,400
