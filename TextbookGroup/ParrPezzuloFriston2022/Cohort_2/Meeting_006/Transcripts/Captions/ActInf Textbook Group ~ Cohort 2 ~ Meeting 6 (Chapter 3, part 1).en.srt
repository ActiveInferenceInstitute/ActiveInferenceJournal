1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,460
okay hello everyone

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,700
it's October 7th 2022 we're in the sixth

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,120
meeting for the second cohort

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,220
of the textbook group

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,119
today we're going to be discussing

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,759
chapter three for the first time

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,920
so we have a few

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,460
questions to explore on three but before

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,739
we do

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,380
would anyone like to just

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,219
say hello or give any

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,040
overview thoughts on chapter three

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,140
before we go into more specific

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,980
questions

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,239
you can raise your hand or just unmute

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,260
and just go for it

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll wait for someone to make a comment

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,740
on chapter three

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,439
yep

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
to active inference with the

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
principle of least action and the

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,459
introduction of

23
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,260
of Markov blankets

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,360
okay how does that differ from previous

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,140
approaches or relative to what

26
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
but

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
I guess instead of instead of starting

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,080
with

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,220
um

30
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,920
instead of starting with the notion that

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,060
you have

32
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,800
some agent

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,280
that's creating a representation of its

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
world

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,860
you

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,360
um

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,500
you start with like in

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,860
axiomatic view from physics

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,440
that

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,319
when applied to

41
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,319
um

42
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,780
to biological entities

43
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,200
GIF leads to the at least the same same

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,580
conclusion

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,540
as chapter two

46
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,319
all right awesome thank you

47
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,540
anyone can raise their hand or just go

48
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,680
for it General thoughts on chapter three

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,180
and or

50
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,980
what is the high road to active

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,399
inference

52
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,000
foreign

53
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,260
having read chapters 2 and 3.

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,019
how does anybody want to remark on

55
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,100
figure 1.2

56
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:46,620
okay I I'll I'll make a short remark

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,919
to me this this figure

58
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,699
um

59
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,540
I guess these uh elements like surprise

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,660
minimization Mark of blanket looks like

61
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,540
they are they are inserted in the

62
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,320
pictures like sequentially but it

63
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,080
doesn't seem to me that they actually

64
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,340
represent a sequence for understanding

65
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,419
the

66
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,479
the the approach they're just various

67
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,960
aspects of uh of either the the physics

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,759
approach or

69
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,259
in the lower part of the figure of the

70
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,280
Bayesian approach

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,560
if I if I understood it correctly

72
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,020
because at first I thought it was like a

73
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,520
path you know starting from the free

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,100
energy principle and then first to

75
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,780
self-organization then surprise

76
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,000
minimization Mark of blanket predictive

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,820
processing and I don't know if it's

78
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,139
if it is actually a progression

79
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,800
of Concepts or actually I don't know

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,000
what do you think

81
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,139
yeah it's a great

82
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,720
question anyone can give a thought

83
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,440
what do the ordering of the terms mean

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,139
are these train stops along the way blue

85
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,039
or child

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,560
so I just wanted to say that um the live

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,259
stream where Maria really gave a lot of

88
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,500
background on predictive processing

89
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,479
predictive coding like the difference

90
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,660
between these two might be super helpful

91
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,120
um with regard to like a progression or

92
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,300
just evaluating that lineage in more

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,660
detail

94
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,800
um yeah sure I'll add link there

95
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
um one option would be that these are

96
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,479
historical like this is this chronology

97
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,220
of ideas another one would be that

98
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,319
they're pedagogical that this is a

99
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,620
learning path another might be uh formal

100
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,940
or technical

101
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,100
like one of them are one of the

102
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,680
directions are dependencies

103
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,020
or required but not necessarily the most

104
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,610
pedagogical path Ali

105
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,080
[Music]

106
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,759
um

107
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
yeah I also think that the organization

108
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,880
of this uh particular figure is more

109
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,860
like the branch

110
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,360
because of a tree and then uh something

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,759
uh sequential so they might not

112
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,240
represent any uh specific preference to

113
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,580
go through all of these steps in order

114
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,400
to achieve a particular goal where just

115
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,759
try it just tries to lump together

116
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,039
relevant Concepts in two different

117
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,919
branches so that's why I see it at least

118
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,340
foreign

119
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,659
yes the tree

120
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,500
um fep tree

121
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,020
from uh 2010

122
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,180
with a lot of the early sort of

123
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,520
directions and pointers towards areas of

124
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
synthesis

125
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
um

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
anyone else want to just add any other

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,900
thoughts like what is the high road

128
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,680
or how did they feel about chapter three

129
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,280
overall

130
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
foreign

131
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,860
Technical and specific questions to dive

132
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,479
into but it's really important to

133
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,299
understand chapter two and the low road

134
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,120
and chapter 3 being the high road and

135
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,640
the way that they're distinguished

136
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
in terms of the low road

137
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,320
beginning from a

138
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,080
framework for doing statistics learning

139
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,540
updating and so on

140
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,820
but not necessarily an imperative for

141
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,140
survival

142
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,440
in contrast in the high road

143
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,750
the beginning

144
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,899
[Music]

145
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,279
stance

146
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,980
is around the imperative for survival

147
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,500
which is kind of a biological way to

148
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,980
frame it or the slightly even more

149
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,440
deflationary imperative for repeated

150
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,820
measurements

151
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,279
which is more of a Quantum or a physics

152
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,580
way to be framing the issue in terms of

153
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,580
stochastic processes and measurement

154
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,959
Theory

155
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,240
where if something cannot be measuring

156
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,279
itself it's not going to see itself

157
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,560
around for long and if something is not

158
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,899
a thing to something else it's not being

159
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,420
measured over a given time scale within

160
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,300
a given variance Criterion it also is

161
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,060
going to be quote not a thing so this

162
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,680
imperative for

163
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,600
uh persistence

164
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,440
and finding manifolds of stability or

165
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,440
bounded spaces

166
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,040
is an imperative that isn't

167
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,200
intrinsically within Bayesian theorem

168
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,720
but active inference is being situated

169
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
at the intersection of the Bayesian

170
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,120
methods and the imperative for

171
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,120
persistence and or recur or repeated

172
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,140
measurements Ali

173
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,560
uh yes one of the I think the most

174
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,260
probably the most Central concept of

175
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,360
chapter three

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,540
uh on which all the other material seems

177
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,800
to

178
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,680
um seems to evolve is the concept of

179
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,040
Mark of blanket but

180
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,220
but in this particular chapter I think

181
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,740
the marker blanket I mean the nature of

182
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,920
markup blanket has not made uh quite

183
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,880
explicit so I just wanted to emphasize a

184
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,700
critical point about this whole concept

185
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,220
which has caused a lot of lots of

186
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,500
confusions and misunderstandings around

187
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,680
it and

188
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,380
namely uh some people think markup

189
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,040
blanket is actually some a kind

190
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,980
of spatial temporal boundary around the

191
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,839
system

192
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,500
but as the paper and Bayesian mechanics

193
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,800
makes clear uh marker blanket is

194
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,399
actually a boundary

195
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,339
a boundary on state space and it doesn't

196
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,040
necessarily or it doesn't always

197
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,720
translate into any spatial temporal

198
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,540
boundary in some cases uh

199
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,980
first

200
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,279
for example in the cells or organelles

201
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
or things like that we can see the

202
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
spatial temporal manifestation of markup

203
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,100
blanket but that's not always the case

204
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,300
so yeah that's one of the points I think

205
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,180
is crucial to understanding this whole

206
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,959
um

207
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,100
High Road approach to active inference

208
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,779
hmm

209
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,880
thank you Ali very interesting points

210
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,860
so they do

211
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,420
in the first box of the chapter and in

212
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,180
the first non-introduction section

213
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,700
discuss Marco blankets so it's

214
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,880
definitely something that we want to um

215
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,040
follow on

216
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,899
so let's

217
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,160
we're

218
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,899
done for now with the just general

219
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,160
discussion around what the high road is

220
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,920
um good yes Giuseppe please

221
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,339
okay no it's just on this topic that

222
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,579
it's true that the mark of blanket is is

223
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,139
explained

224
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,220
they quite clearly if if succinctly in

225
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,800
that part but

226
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,480
then I don't think it throughout the

227
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,839
book is actually

228
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,779
uh is actually

229
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,639
used

230
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,040
or describe the in details from the

231
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,220
computational point of view

232
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,200
that I

233
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,440
mean I think it's it's

234
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
it's described it's it's defined there

235
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,779
but then I to me since that doesn't

236
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,060
appear much in the in the more

237
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,459
computational later parts of the book

238
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:30,018
that that was my impression

239
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,060
so

240
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,779
the concept is quite clear

241
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,660
uh but

242
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,399
I'm not sure how it um it applies then

243
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,920
practically just just laying out the

244
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,620
model probably in laying out the

245
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
specifics of the model that that defines

246
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,100
by itself the the the relevant Mark of

247
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,860
blanket probably

248
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,240
thank you

249
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,410
um Ali

250
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,139
[Music]

251
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,220
uh yes uh one reason for that might be

252
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,320
at least according to my personal

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,220
communication with Maxwell ramstead uh

254
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,100
you see uh the problem of identifying

255
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,660
markup blankets from data uh is still an

256
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,899
outstanding uh issue and problem uh

257
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,399
among fep researchers uh on which versus

258
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,380
lab is actively working on so that's not

259
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:40,160
a resolved problem I guess uh yet so

260
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,560
that's I think one of the reasons they

261
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,240
have not alluded to the concept of

262
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,860
Market blankets

263
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,959
so much throughout the whole through the

264
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,120
throughout the rest of the book uh the

265
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
other reason is uh the recent literature

266
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
somehow tries to uh

267
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
reduce its dependence on this whole

268
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,199
concept of markup blanket

269
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,000
um because of various reasons

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,680
so yeah these two reasons might be

271
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,660
sufficient to explain its lack of

272
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,940
appearance or at least explicit

273
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,220
appearance

274
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,220
in much of the book

275
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,120
Thank you

276
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
great yeah I think um this this question

277
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,040
will help us dive further into this

278
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,820
question

279
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,300
on page 43

280
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,760
they uh are writing so first off anyone

281
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,380
who wanted to describe on a more

282
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
technical note we can bring it up later

283
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,760
or sooner what a Markov blanket is

284
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,880
because it is one of the core

285
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,959
um

286
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,139
terms in brief a markup blanket is the

287
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,940
set of variables that mediate all

288
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,740
statistical interactions between a

289
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,440
system and environments and those

290
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
parentheses cover a lot that is not the

291
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,860
same thing as the actual mechanical or

292
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,600
material interactions between the system

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,180
and the environments that is the map

294
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,820
territory fallacy or failure to

295
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,040
distinguish although one can't also

296
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,779
swing too far into the map territory

297
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,420
fallacy fallacy area which we've talked

298
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,279
about earlier

299
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,320
um

300
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,760
this

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,060
the markout blanket and what it does

302
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,940
is a restatement of the classical action

303
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,860
perception cycle

304
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,260
where an Adaptive system and its

305
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,940
environment can interact only through

306
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,120
actions and observations respectively

307
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,480
so how's the Marco blanket a restatement

308
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,759
of the classical action perception cycle

309
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,940
I feel that this is an important

310
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,600
question to understand to contextualize

311
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,060
active inference Within

312
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,780
the history of models like cybernetics

313
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,099
control theory ecological psychology

314
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,579
and qualitative and quantitative models

315
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,400
of perception and action

316
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,339
kind of goes without saying but it's a

317
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,099
really important note

318
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,079
and we see multiple representations of

319
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,600
the action perception Loop

320
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,540
so figure three one

321
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,480
shows the auction perception Loop

322
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,799
along with the particular partition

323
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,840
that's the one that's separated into

324
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,120
internal and external States along with

325
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
the blanket States

326
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,419
which makes internal and external

327
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,280
conditionally independent

328
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,700
and then the blanket states are further

329
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,460
decomposed into active States those with

330
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,440
outgoing dependencies from the

331
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,820
perspective of internal States and

332
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,799
sensory States those with internal

333
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,360
dependencies

334
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,419
although note some asterisks in the

335
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,700
interpretation for example around which

336
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,980
arrows have two directions and which

337
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,059
ones don't

338
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,160
so here's figure 3.1

339
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,900
the Markov blanket it's Dynamic it's

340
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,520
changing in time the states are changing

341
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,480
in time

342
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,179
separating partitioning

343
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,179
internal States hear the brain from the

344
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,380
environments

345
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,660
and all of the functions

346
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,460
are described in terms of rates of

347
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,240
change x u y and mu

348
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,400
and the dot over the top is like the

349
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,679
derivative so they're all being solved

350
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,299
for in terms of how they change their

351
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,140
time

352
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,419
and they're all being described with

353
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,900
these F functions that are themselves

354
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,240
comprised of a deterministic

355
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,039
component

356
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,039
that's the um average rate of change

357
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
over these arguments coming into the

358
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
deterministic components of the equation

359
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,340
and

360
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,039
Omega which is some sort of random

361
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,260
fluctuation parameter

362
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,000
so it's kind of like a signal to noise

363
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
partitioning

364
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,200
statistical variance

365
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,760
Within

366
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,000
the change characteristics

367
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,059
of a given state

368
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,980
corresponding to particular partitioned

369
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,419
variables

370
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,500
but we've also seen other

371
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,480
representations of the action perception

372
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,860
Loop

373
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,620
so here's one of the simpler ones from

374
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,660
figure one this is the first figure in

375
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,980
the book

376
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,799
and we can think about how like the

377
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,120
active States even though they're coming

378
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,320
up

379
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,880
from the right here and they're coming

380
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,660
kind of down from the left here

381
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,960
in both situations it's like this is the

382
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,039
engagement

383
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,679
between the agent and the niche

384
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,660
okay but then there are some other

385
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,700
representations too

386
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,100
like figure two two

387
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,360
here

388
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,820
we see a proto-blanket forming though

389
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
not described as such and without like

390
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,460
for example an arrow connecting

391
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,980
these two nodes between observation and

392
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,360
action

393
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
and more of an emphasis on the way that

394
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,700
hidden states are being either actually

395
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,880
generative of the observations that's

396
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,520
the generative process or that hidden

397
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,039
states of the generative model are doing

398
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,340
inference on the observations

399
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,020
so that's one other

400
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,700
um representation

401
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,059
and then there's this representation

402
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,640
where here action is coming out of

403
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,080
discrepancy

404
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,140
as is perception learning generative

405
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,880
model change

406
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,740
and we see observation coming into

407
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,660
discrepancy

408
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,140
so

409
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,860
what is the action perception cycle

410
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,380
and where do Markov blankets come into

411
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,760
play

412
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,179
in terms of even the classical ways of

413
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,799
thinking about control systems

414
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,840
if one looks up control Loop

415
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,380
they'll find all kinds of diagrams

416
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,360
from cybernetics and control theory

417
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,980
that can entirely be interpreted

418
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,220
within a sort of entity

419
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,380
getting input doing some sort of

420
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,799
processing and having outputs

421
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,840
so

422
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,880
how is the Marco blanket helping us

423
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,520
approach this Nexus of the entity in the

424
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,879
niche

425
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,820
well one thought or important piece to

426
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,340
note is that

427
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,960
some blanket States will exist

428
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,500
for any Bayesian graph that isn't fully

429
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,760
connected

430
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,919
anytime that you have a non-fully

431
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,440
connected base graph so not every node

432
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,240
is connected to every node

433
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,960
then there will be some other nodes

434
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,460
upon which

435
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,039
two other sets are a conditionally

436
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,780
independent

437
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,419
that's just what the nodes and edges

438
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,559
mean

439
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,799
in this kind of a graphical model

440
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,500
which is if nodes are random variables

441
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,679
and edges are statistical relationships

442
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,900
then nodes directly connected by an edge

443
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,299
have a direct statistical relationship

444
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,760
again not implying anything about the

445
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,159
material or the causal nature of the

446
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,179
world

447
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,440
so then

448
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,100
if two nodes do not have a statistical

449
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,900
relationship

450
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,640
they're either part of two different

451
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,919
graphs which can be seen as basically

452
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,720
partitions from each other

453
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
or they're going to be part of a

454
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,520
connected component of a graph

455
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,460
but there's some other nodes one or more

456
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,539
that intermediate such that those two

457
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,100
nodes of Interest

458
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,960
which are arbitrarily called internal

459
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,340
and external

460
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,039
have conditional independencies

461
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,440
that ends up simplifying and being

462
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,320
important for a lot of the computation

463
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,559
and it respects and reflects the sparse

464
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,000
coupling

465
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,620
of features in the world

466
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,580
so it's always just important to like

467
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,220
think back like where is something new

468
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,940
coming in

469
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,220
to active inference people have been

470
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,440
using partially observable Markov

471
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,299
decision processes

472
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,700
for many years for perception and

473
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,179
control issues before active inference

474
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,039
those models

475
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,480
also

476
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,360
are imbued with Markov blankets

477
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,880
just like any other

478
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,620
um

479
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,659
markovian setting in Time series

480
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,600
analysis or any sort of partially

481
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,299
observable model

482
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,980
so

483
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,980
just an important question for discourse

484
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,840
to continue on

485
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,299
how is the Marco blanket restating the

486
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,700
classical action perception cycle Ollie

487
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,840
yeah just as a side note I wanted to

488
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,720
point out again to um

489
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,780
I think an important error in this

490
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,480
particular figure

491
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,140
which I've included in the Errata so if

492
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,700
yeah and added a note there uh so if you

493
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,280
could please open

494
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:08,280
uh yeah for this yeah and open

495
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,940
the notes there I've added the

496
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,340
explanation for why

497
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,000
exactly yes thank you

498
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,520
so let's just put it

499
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,080
what Giuseppe no it makes sense the the

500
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,960
I think it's well spotted

501
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,659
yes there's many

502
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,020
changes and and um so again these are

503
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,700
like why it's so important for everybody

504
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,640
to make asynchronous contributions and

505
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,799
questions if they can

506
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,720
this is how we actually are going to

507
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,360
move the needle on the textbook making

508
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,179
sense and making impact

509
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,919
I know it's like an individual sense

510
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,840
making Journey as well

511
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,880
but also these kinds of questions like

512
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,860
what does this mean and the discourse

513
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,080
around them is gonna

514
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,419
catalyze the actual use of this area

515
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,100
like

516
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,840
um do you want to summarize what the

517
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,279
difference is between the existing

518
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,340
equations and the replacement

519
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,340
sure uh you see in the existing equation

520
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,120
in the book The marginal flow of sensory

521
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,480
states are expressed

522
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,320
uh in terms of blanket States namely U

523
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,539
and Y

524
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:32,100
and also the um the inter the

525
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,960
um I mean the external state but uh the

526
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,240
it should be the other way around I mean

527
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,059
the marginal flow sensory State should

528
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,279
be expressed only in terms of external

529
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,620
States and blanket States and the

530
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,559
marginal flow of active States should be

531
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,600
expressed in terms of

532
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,720
are only internal States and the blanket

533
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,860
States

534
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,940
thank you so yeah just to restate that

535
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,480
and also to build some intuition with

536
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,820
what these flows are and how they relate

537
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,080
so you and Y constitute B the blanket

538
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,539
States so sometimes you and Y are both

539
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,620
written

540
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,140
or B is written

541
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,360
to describe the blanket State variables

542
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,700
other times it might just be describing

543
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,679
a subset at which point not the whole

544
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,900
blank is being described just for

545
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,580
example the active States U or the

546
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,740
sensory States y are being described

547
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,179
then mu our internal States here and X

548
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,580
you know find x hidden States external

549
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,700
states with a note here that the

550
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,840
variables are different in different

551
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,279
presentations

552
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,900
so

553
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,640
um as it was written

554
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
we can read that this is the change in U

555
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,120
which is the active States is a function

556
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,260
of first a stochastic parameter about

557
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,940
you itself

558
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,740
but then the deterministic component

559
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,559
here is a function of the blanket States

560
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,900
and the hidden States

561
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,299
and conversely as written

562
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,760
why the change in observations Through

563
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,600
Time

564
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,539
is after accounting for a stochastic

565
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,740
term a flow function on blanket States

566
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,260
and internal States

567
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,679
whereas it's actually exactly the

568
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,740
opposite with X and mu being switched

569
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,220
between these two because actions should

570
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,919
reflect a flow over blanket and internal

571
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,000
States

572
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,700
sometimes called the particular States

573
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,860
because that's the particle that's

574
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,020
moving around that's the Bayesian

575
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,940
mechanical particle

576
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,940
and then observations should reflect a

577
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,880
flow on blanket States themselves

578
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,380
and hidden states of the world

579
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,059
foreign

580
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,460
and that's very related to this other

581
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,179
question so uh what does figure 3.1 mean

582
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,360
I think that's what we're looking at

583
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,299
how is it different than figure two five

584
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,679
and how is the agent's Niche

585
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,659
relationship describe qualitatively and

586
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,580
formally in active inference in other

587
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,740
areas so I think we kind of explored

588
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,520
that

589
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,380
um people can add any more notes but

590
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,600
this is like a really important level to

591
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,100
pull back to

592
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,220
whether it's somebody who's having a

593
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,779
question

594
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,080
or even uh well-intended or not

595
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,960
criticism of active inference or a

596
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,340
control theory

597
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,700
it can be useful are they describing

598
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,159
challenges of the world

599
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,799
like the map territory difference like

600
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,840
the complexity of the world always

601
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,940
transcending the structure and

602
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,460
complexity of our own models or

603
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,919
referring to the fundamental issues of

604
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,120
taking action amidst uncertainty

605
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,659
are people pointing to those issues and

606
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,840
then part of the community

607
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,919
describing the agent niche qualitatively

608
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,260
and or formally

609
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,520
or

610
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
are they sort of

611
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,620
suggesting or implying some kind of like

612
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,440
hidden other way of thinking about how

613
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,440
agents engage in the niche

614
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,880
because there's a lot of questions that

615
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
can arise

616
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,620
but these framings although here the

617
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,840
Markov blanket gives that kind of a

618
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,020
Bayesian statistical and graphical

619
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,640
um

620
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,840
uh stance on it and implementation

621
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,539
opportunity space which includes an

622
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,799
incredible number of computational

623
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,720
affordances like message passing

624
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,600
variational inference and so on

625
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,679
um

626
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,080
this

627
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,179
partitioning of the entity from the

628
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,399
niche figure from grounds

629
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,260
is not diverging from the traditions

630
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,919
of cybernetics and other areas

631
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,500
so just kind of like interesting are

632
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,720
people pointing to fundamental issues of

633
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,580
perception and action

634
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,480
which in some senses is our field

635
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,159
and are they

636
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,080
part of the building and the sense

637
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,140
making around those

638
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,500
scientific and meta-scientific models

639
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,960
or is it just a position of like well

640
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,460
it's not possible to model this

641
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,480
kind of random thought but

642
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,700
okay thank you

643
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,080
yes Ali

644
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,120
uh sorry just one other brief side note

645
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,320
about the term you used there the

646
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,620
particle particular States uh which you

647
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,020
mentioned is the joint set of the

648
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,539
blanket states and and the internal

649
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:12,840
State the other related term used in the

650
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,299
literature is the autonomous state which

651
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,299
refers to the Joint set of internal and

652
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,260
active States instead of the blanket

653
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,020
States we only take the internal active

654
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,140
States as the autonomous States or paths

655
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,399
that's just

656
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,380
thank you

657
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,620
this would kind of be a uh uh first and

658
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,080
ask phrasing that the idea that these

659
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,880
different

660
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,039
um sets are going to inherit from the

661
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,480
particular partition

662
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,980
so the first move is the base graph to

663
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,960
the particular partition

664
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,500
which is just this specific partition

665
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,480
between internal external States

666
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,659
mediated by a Markov blanket then

667
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,340
sometimes it's useful to talk about

668
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,320
specific

669
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,200
um sub sets of the particular partition

670
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,380
if we were only interested in one of

671
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,820
these categories we would just call it

672
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,340
by name like talking about just external

673
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,340
States or external State 11 dimension

674
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,720
11.

675
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,740
um but other times we want to talk about

676
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,600
partitioned States but still refer to

677
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,140
more than one type of state and so Ali

678
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,260
brought in this seconds clustering

679
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,880
the particular States that's the

680
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,220
particle that's moving around that's the

681
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,860
whole entity internal States and blanket

682
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,019
States and then also times it's

683
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,600
important to consider the action in the

684
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,399
internal States

685
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,919
because those are kind of the ones that

686
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,519
can be thought of as in a total control

687
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,740
situation they're the ones that are

688
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,899
under Direct Control

689
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,600
so like you can control your mind and

690
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,519
you can control your action

691
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,080
those are the autonomous States whereas

692
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,000
you can't directly influence sensory

693
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,019
States

694
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,639
but you might be able to take actions

695
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,679
that modify sensory states by changing

696
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,359
where you look or by changing some

697
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,460
aspect of the world

698
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,820
um so those are autonomous States and it

699
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,339
relates to this question can surprise

700
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:24,080
only be diminished through action

701
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,239
what does anyone think

702
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,918
foreign

703
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,379
here's the throwback to yes Ali first

704
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,719
yeah I just I wanted to point out to

705
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,239
exactly that uh the same place in the

706
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,280
text

707
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,159
which I as far as I know there are two

708
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,580
basic ways to uh reduce the surprisal or

709
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,520
minimize the surprise one of which is uh

710
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,740
through the action and the other one is

711
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,400
through updating the uh generative model

712
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,020
so

713
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,220
Yep this is the uh

714
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,160
changed beliefs

715
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,020
which is speaking more broadly than

716
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,060
personally held convictions

717
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,520
this is going to be pointing towards the

718
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,040
Continuum between perception learning

719
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,160
and deeper belief States in generative

720
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,420
models

721
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,880
so perception is changing beliefs

722
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,000
Bayesian beliefs which is to say

723
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,859
updating the generative model learning

724
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,540
and perception

725
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,339
on the other hand

726
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,619
there's action which can change the

727
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,619
world and so out of this discrepancy

728
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,320
it can be dissipated two ways it's kind

729
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,660
of like if there was like a Delta G A

730
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,339
Gibbs free energy

731
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,680
like something that was

732
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,119
um combustible

733
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,740
there's like a hill to go down

734
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,260
energetically and so now we're in an

735
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,700
informational space

736
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,180
but there's still at the um

737
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,960
Clash of predictions and observations

738
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,079
is a non-zero discrepancy

739
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,260
and from that discrepancy there can be

740
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,820
changes in the generative model

741
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,140
parameters

742
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,060
reflecting beliefs

743
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,000
and also

744
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
recourse to action

745
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,599
and active inference is about how

746
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,940
generative models which include beliefs

747
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,560
about action

748
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,079
resolve this kind of Nexus

749
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,520
through the flows on updating

750
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
oh sorry

751
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,300
um yeah what is the difference between

752
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:55,760
belief updating and mental action

753
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,079
all added as a question and then someone

754
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,740
can give a thought

755
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,779
any thoughts

756
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,839
well maybe mental action

757
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,610
um refers to the active States of

758
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,160
[Music]

759
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,839
um and nested more more nested Mark of

760
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,180
blanket so

761
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,400
it's

762
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,920
it's a

763
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,140
it's an action it's a modulation of

764
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,760
precision

765
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,460
on the

766
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,040
within the generative model and it's not

767
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,160
a motor action you know through motor

768
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,879
effectors

769
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,160
foreign

770
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,480
states that actually communicate with

771
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,700
the external world

772
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,098
but it's still internal

773
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,980
that's I don't know that's my take on it

774
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,060
may be wrong

775
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,480
yeah very uh nice I think just

776
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,400
more more discussions can be added so

777
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,320
just giving a quick thought belief

778
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,339
updating

779
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,740
could refer to any kind of parametric

780
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,500
updating at all it doesn't even have to

781
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,119
be like a cognitive model belief

782
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,220
updating is just any time that there's a

783
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,000
prior

784
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,339
that meets with an observation and gets

785
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,260
updated into a posterior

786
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,720
you have belief updating and we can use

787
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,760
Bayesian surprise to talk about belief

788
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,320
updating and so on

789
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,180
then as pointed out mental action as

790
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,839
it's used in the hierarchical models of

791
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,560
it

792
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,520
is referring to the policy selection

793
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,180
process that's hinted in the action

794
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,119
but the policy selection process or

795
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,900
module or archetype as oriented around

796
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,359
mental variables

797
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,500
so

798
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,460
it is almost out of necessity requiring

799
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,859
a nested or a hierarchical model

800
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,960
because there has to be like a sort of

801
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,400
base layer that is not mental action

802
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,800
but then at the second level or above

803
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,000
you can start to see the same kind of Pi

804
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,260
policy variables and the same way of

805
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,240
thinking about affordances and free

806
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,560
energy and expected free energy

807
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,200
minimization processes in the second

808
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,940
level or above

809
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,420
where those action like processes

810
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,780
or maybe even genuine action processes

811
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,640
are referring to cognitive States rather

812
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,099
than a motor effector as would be

813
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,740
understood as in the case of like

814
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,920
conventional motor action

815
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,839
whereas belief updating does not require

816
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,660
a hierarchical model it's just referring

817
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,960
very very broadly to Bayesian parametric

818
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,260
change

819
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,520
that makes sense thank you

820
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,320
all right so

821
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,099
um

822
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,380
can surprise be managed

823
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,460
um through action

824
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,180
no not only

825
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,839
like

826
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,820
you're surprised you know you expect it

827
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,339
to be 20 degrees

828
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,520
um and you're observing it's 25.

829
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,440
you can either engage in accent

830
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,000
selection to change the thermometer

831
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,339
under beliefs about how one's actions

832
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,920
change the world B Matrix

833
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,500
or one can just update

834
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,420
their model

835
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,359
two that is now what I expect

836
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,220
and of course that's the fun discussion

837
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,960
in active inference with expect and

838
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,980
prefer

839
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,800
because if organisms are in the game of

840
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,740
diminishing or bounding surprise

841
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,020
then there has to be this nuanced dance

842
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,359
between

843
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,720
what is being observed understanding it

844
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,820
to be simply the most likely

845
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,680
but you don't want to be on the likely

846
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,380
train off the cliff

847
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,579
so there has to also be a space for

848
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:32,040
slightly or very stubborn prior

849
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,260
preference distributions

850
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,619
that enable

851
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,200
increasingly intense policies

852
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,720
to be implemented

853
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,599
to actually shape the state of the world

854
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,599
and oneself back towards

855
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,020
that earlier expectation and preference

856
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,500
rather than engaging in just purely

857
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,880
cognitive updating

858
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,800
that's just speaking about it generally

859
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,200
but there's a lot to um

860
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,359
unpack

861
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:07,920
in a more um

862
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,720
model specific way

863
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,480
okay I'll leave share the link

864
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,320
oh awesome

865
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,800
awesome this looks like a good reference

866
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,900
and also uh live stream 25

867
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,579
I believe

868
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,079
was on mental action Sanford Smith

869
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,240
okay

870
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,579
let's

871
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,520
look towards this

872
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,800
question

873
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,200
does anyone want to just give an example

874
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,640
they can clarify synchrony between

875
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,839
internal and external States

876
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,560
what's the situation where we can think

877
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,819
of internal and external State

878
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,599
synchronizing

879
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,380
well I guess it depends on what we mean

880
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,520
by synchrony I mean synchrony like in uh

881
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,599
in on a fast time scale or

882
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,240
on a specific time scale

883
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,980
or

884
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,500
because the fact that the internal State

885
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,099
the reflect the the causal dynamics of

886
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,900
the environment

887
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,339
does not imply that they are immediately

888
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,480
synchronized right

889
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,560
yeah you're absolutely right the time

890
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,480
scale really matters and also it's

891
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,280
important to note that synchrony doesn't

892
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,680
mean lockstep it doesn't mean that

893
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,540
there's like a thermometer inside and a

894
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,099
thermometer outside and they're just

895
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,200
following each other

896
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,740
um synchrony can refer to the kind of

897
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,540
coordination that's more like

898
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,000
orchestrated

899
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,819
in the sense that if you had um two

900
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,060
people you know sawing a tree

901
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,800
they're both going to be taking opposite

902
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,480
actions

903
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,280
but there's still as high Mutual

904
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,380
information between those two action

905
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,480
policies

906
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,760
and they're able to be under General

907
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,099
synchrony

908
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,599
um so we can just think of a few areas

909
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,280
of examples

910
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,859
like one can always think of a computer

911
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:47,579
example because computers are clean

912
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,040
like you could just say well I have two

913
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,720
servers

914
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,900
and they're communicating on the time

915
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,280
or they're sending each other

916
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,680
information back and forth

917
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,480
or they're tracking some feature about

918
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,520
each other

919
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,079
you could imagine a communication

920
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,400
example

921
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,540
where there's some kind of semantic

922
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,579
coordination or synchrony

923
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,500
you could also imagine some kind of a

924
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,180
cellular or a physiological synchrony

925
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,760
like the inside of the cell is being

926
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,480
modeled as doing inference about insulin

927
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,640
levels outside of the cell and then the

928
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,400
insulin receptor is like the interface

929
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,579
and so there's synchronization

930
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,640
of cellular response to perceived or

931
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,819
inferred insulin concentration and the

932
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,520
external unobserved true circulating

933
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,160
insulin concentration mediated through

934
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,460
set States The Binding kinetics of

935
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,859
insulin on its receptors

936
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:55,800
like these are just kind of qualitative

937
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,240
examples but

938
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,920
there's a lot to

939
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,480
um drill down into more Ali

940
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,940
I think uh the word synchrony here uh

941
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,619
might have been used in the technical

942
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:13,380
term of uh the existence of a kind of

943
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,839
synchrony map between the two coupling

944
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,780
systems uh so in order for two systems

945
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,060
to be coupled there needs to be a

946
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,640
synchrony map uh namely Sigma between

947
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,599
them and uh the whole paper worked

948
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,319
example a paper by the alternate value

949
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,920
well provides uh multiple uh physical

950
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,859
examples for these kind of systems a

951
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:39,319
couple

952
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:43,680
systems and the most extreme case of

953
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,800
um those couple systems are the sparse

954
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,760
coupled systems in which the markup

955
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,800
blanket uh is the strongest or as they

956
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,040
call it the blanketedness or the blanket

957
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,099
index uh is basically zero but in some

958
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:09,000
other kinds of systems which in which

959
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,300
the internal and external states are

960
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,579
somehow more

961
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:17,520
closely follow each other the markup

962
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
blanket tends to

963
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,680
weaken and diminish so

964
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,160
yeah I think that's the meaning of the

965
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,440
word synchrony here

966
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,720
great Point

967
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,440
um

968
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,940
yep live stream 49.1 with Jacob and Ali

969
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,760
this week

970
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,280
it's recommended listen

971
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,140
and it's um

972
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,079
quite far-ranging so that is the most

973
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,420
state-of-the-art addressment of the

974
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,260
issue

975
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,900
a slightly older addressment of this

976
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,819
issue and also

977
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,680
um importantly coming back to what Ellie

978
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,480
mentioned about like the synchronization

979
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,859
manifold

980
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:06,420
so here's the uh example of bird song

981
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,060
that friston and friston and frith have

982
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,260
worked on

983
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,839
and uh this is some of the colorized

984
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,579
versions of the trace diagrams that are

985
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:18,839
seen in the textbook that are like a

986
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,220
little bit difficult to tell what's

987
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,599
happening when they're on colored lines

988
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,980
but just a

989
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,099
highlight the manifold there the x-axis

990
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,339
and the y-axis are the first and the

991
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,280
second Bird's belief States

992
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,310
and so

993
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:36,839
[Music]

994
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:37,619
um

995
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,260
to the extent that those

996
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,859
pairs of beliefs at a given moment exist

997
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:46,980
on the Y equals X line

998
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,020
they're believing the same thing at the

999
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,040
same time

1000
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,079
whereas if you could imagine if they

1001
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,579
were believing opposite things at the

1002
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:54,780
same time you'd have like a negative

1003
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,640
regression and if there was like

1004
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,560
uncorrelated

1005
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,619
or unsynchronized belief updating you'd

1006
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,839
have just a scatter Cloud that wouldn't

1007
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,359
have a significant regression slope

1008
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,160
and so this diagram is showing how

1009
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,319
before and after learning

1010
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,680
the sharpness of the manifold

1011
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,560
increases and a manifold is a lower

1012
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,599
dimensional space within a higher

1013
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,880
dimensional space so like we have a

1014
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,359
two-dimensional space here with X and Y

1015
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:26,280
and then

1016
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,900
there's activity only on this manifold

1017
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,380
which is being rejected effectively not

1018
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,599
completely down into one dimension

1019
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,819
because it's like a number line

1020
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,319
or you can imagine it was a

1021
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,640
three-dimensional space that was being

1022
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,140
projected into a two-dimensional

1023
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,440
manifold so manifold is just some lower

1024
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,180
dimensional

1025
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,940
structure in a higher dimensional phase

1026
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,300
space

1027
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,300
and so synchrony as Ali mentioned is

1028
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,040
referring

1029
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,480
um quite

1030
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,040
particularly technically to

1031
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,260
the um existence of synchronization

1032
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,000
manifolds

1033
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,280
and that is related to sparse coupling

1034
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,980
blanket index all these topics all right

1035
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,440
so in our last couple minutes we'll look

1036
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,640
at this question about 3.4.1 and then

1037
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,220
um over the coming week just

1038
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,720
chill enjoy the week also add a few

1039
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,300
other questions or discourse so that we

1040
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,700
can come back to some of the latter

1041
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,119
sections of chapter three

1042
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,119
um next week so let's look at three four

1043
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,359
one

1044
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,099
in three four one

1045
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:45,780
that's the section variational free

1046
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,119
energy model evidence and surprise the

1047
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,740
authors look at the equivalence between

1048
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,839
variational free energy

1049
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,819
model evidence and surprise and

1050
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,520
formalize this relationship in equation

1051
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,520
3.2 is it possible to unpack equation

1052
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,160
3.2 to make these relationships easy to

1053
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,599
understand

1054
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,240
great question all right

1055
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,819
so let's go to equation 3.2

1056
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,559
here's what the equation looks like

1057
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,099
then

1058
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,079
our um

1059
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,140
extremely helpful annotation

1060
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,558
group

1061
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,599
has gone through and provided this

1062
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,880
natural language

1063
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,800
unpacking so I'm just going to copy it

1064
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,720
down and then we can look at what it

1065
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,220
actually says

1066
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,579
and then see how that relates to the the

1067
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:40,440
question that was asked

1068
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,839
which was about unpacking the

1069
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,259
relationship

1070
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,800
okay so the surprise

1071
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,920
fracture I fancy I of the data y

1072
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,579
conditioned vertical line on the model m

1073
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,619
is equal to

1074
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,400
the negative natural log Ln

1075
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,940
of the conditional probability that's p

1076
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,280
of the data y given m

1077
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:15,240
with its upper bound being so this is a

1078
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,040
less than or equal to sign so they could

1079
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,059
be equal

1080
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:19,980
these two the first and the second one

1081
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,960
are equal

1082
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,300
the second one and the third one could

1083
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,400
be equal or

1084
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,700
the third term could be larger

1085
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,579
it's upper bound being the KL Divergence

1086
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:33,839
dkl

1087
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,640
between

1088
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,740
two lines

1089
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,780
the approximate posterior of hidden

1090
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,780
States Q of X and the conditional

1091
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,460
probability p

1092
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,180
of hidden States X

1093
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,640
conditioned vertical line on the data

1094
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,118
and the model

1095
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,059
minus

1096
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:00,599
the natural log of the model evidence

1097
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,760
P of the Y given the model

1098
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,520
evidence for the data given the model

1099
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,520
okay so the question was

1100
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,500
what are the relationships between

1101
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,079
variational free energy

1102
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:15,119
that's the third term

1103
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,460
model evidence the second term and

1104
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,480
surprise the first term

1105
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,660
the answer is not in the simple reading

1106
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,760
of the equation but

1107
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,140
that

1108
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,660
gets us to

1109
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,760
the discussion point

1110
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,400
so how are these terms related the three

1111
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,839
labeled terms on the bottom

1112
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:47,460
a related question is why do we use

1113
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,599
variational free energy

1114
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,900
what is effective or useful about energy

1115
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,280
measures at all

1116
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,880
I'll give one thought and then one or

1117
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,220
two other people could could add in

1118
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,780
which is

1119
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,440
um

1120
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,940
we

1121
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,660
don't want to be outside of our range of

1122
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,400
surprise

1123
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,339
and so by defining surprise in terms of

1124
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:28,880
data

1125
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,780
um and specifically within the natural

1126
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,020
log space of data which has some just

1127
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,780
nice properties

1128
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,220
um

1129
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,460
we want to stay bounded in the model

1130
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,400
evidence if we want to have high or the

1131
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,200
highest

1132
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,040
or at least adequate model evidence

1133
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,740
and that is equivalent to surprise we

1134
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,420
can see the same y given m

1135
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,559
now if we had that and had confidence

1136
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:03,540
without a doubt in our model

1137
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,280
and we knew how to calculate the

1138
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,619
likelihood function of the data

1139
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:10,619
then things would be easy and there are

1140
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,119
situations where things are easy like

1141
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,200
that

1142
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,500
but there's other cases where we can

1143
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,440
bound our surprisal which is to say

1144
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,380
bound our model evidence

1145
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,040
evidence lower bound the elbow elbow

1146
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,559
and we can bound this intractable

1147
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,700
quantity model evidence

1148
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,480
with a divergence-based energy

1149
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,380
calculation

1150
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,200
and so we can do gradient descent

1151
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,260
variational inference message passing

1152
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,800
to block prints all these amazing things

1153
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,220
on the variational free energy

1154
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,000
and just know that at best we're going

1155
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,740
to converge to the model evidence

1156
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,780
so this is an optimization of an

1157
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,280
optimizable quantity

1158
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,200
of variational free energy

1159
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,300
whereas model evidence is like if you

1160
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,520
know it you know it but if you don't

1161
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,200
you're kind of stuck

1162
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,559
like How likely is this book

1163
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:21,359
and it's super hard to understand how

1164
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,040
changing one word would change the

1165
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,160
overall likelihood distribution

1166
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,780
and so that motivates approximate

1167
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,440
heuristics for Bayesian inference

1168
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,780
especially those that are authorized by

1169
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,160
the sparsity of the data

1170
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,440
and the variational free energy measure

1171
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,319
allows us to bound surprise with

1172
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,020
attractable Optima optimizable

1173
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,680
function

1174
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,460
rather than needing to for example

1175
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,559
flesh out the total space of data

1176
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,099
likelihoods and model likelihoods

1177
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:05,300
which might be futile

1178
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,640
I'm sure there are other better ways to

1179
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,299
add things

1180
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,740
so

1181
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,260
so one thing that

1182
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,420
[Music]

1183
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,160
um

1184
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,099
like after reading it uh

1185
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:36,450
after reading about

1186
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,619
[Music]

1187
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,480
the after reading a book and after

1188
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,680
reading other article it I kind of had

1189
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,079
an Insight but I don't know if if it's

1190
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,180
correct so that

1191
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,000
the old energy stuff of course comes

1192
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,300
from the physics and it's very

1193
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,760
legitimate to be a bit

1194
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,680
um a bit

1195
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,180
a bit confused because this formulation

1196
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,839
of uh with the Callback Library

1197
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:10,319
Divergence is a purely statistical

1198
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,240
um

1199
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,839
quantity so I it's understandable that

1200
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,880
somebody says what does energy have to

1201
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,200
do with that

1202
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,859
it seems to mean that

1203
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:27,000
the two con the the the high high road

1204
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,480
and the Lower Road converge here because

1205
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,839
when you minimize the on your hand you

1206
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,400
can see you can say that the organism

1207
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,960
maintains its forms and function by

1208
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,780
minimizing surprise and that is uh

1209
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,339
maximizing model evidence

1210
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:50,220
but on the other hand

1211
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,460
if you do this

1212
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,059
um you're gonna be able to compute the

1213
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:00,319
approximate posterior that a good

1214
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,700
approximate posterior

1215
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,859
about the states the q and x the Q of x

1216
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,700
so

1217
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,900
in a sense here surprise minimization is

1218
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,280
also a way

1219
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,780
to compute a good posterior over the

1220
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,020
states

1221
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,940
all right great thanks for that

1222
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,799
no

1223
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:28,859
we'll return to this yes let's return to

1224
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:30,540
it pick up here and any other questions

1225
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,460
in next week

1226
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,440
so thank you

1227
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,119
see you all later

1228
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,839
thank you
