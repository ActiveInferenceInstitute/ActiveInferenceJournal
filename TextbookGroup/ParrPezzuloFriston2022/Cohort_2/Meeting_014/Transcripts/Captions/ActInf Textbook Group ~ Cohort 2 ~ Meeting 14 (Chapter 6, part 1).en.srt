1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,080
hello welcome thanks everyone it's

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
February 1st 2023.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,740
we're in meeting 14.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,280
cohort 2 of the paradol textbook

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,119
were on chapter six

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,320
so

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,660
today we can

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,640
look over

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,920
any and all of the questions on chapter

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,119
six

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,400
that have been raised

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,480
we can also go to the text but just to

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,219
begin does anyone want to bring up any

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,100
quote or

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,920
topic or or anything about chapter six

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,800
or any section from the text or question

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
that someone wants to go to first or a

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,920
general point about chapter six

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,899
um Ali and then anyone else

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,019
uh well I think now that the white paper

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,979
from versus lab is published it might be

22
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,180
a good idea to read designing ecosystems

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,920
white paper along with chapter six

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,740
because it can provide a much wider

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,880
perspective and see how

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,200
uh how the research in developing these

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,880
kinds of active inference based AI uh is

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,920
currently developing and uh to see how

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,380
the plan for the future developments

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,740
have already been

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,979
discussed especially in the the case for

32
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,020
uh sympathetic and shared intelligence

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,040
which uh is kind of

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,420
long-term plan to develop those kinds of

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,640
intelligence systems so yeah I think

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,180
this paper can

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,399
immensely help to see the big picture

38
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,780
related for Designing these kinds of

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,818
um

40
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,520
active imprint space models

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,260
awesome

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,739
thanks yeah the the first 20 pages of

43
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,140
the paper have great points but just to

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,640
jump to the the timeline part

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
it's 2023. this was released at the end

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
of 22.

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,400
and

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,680
in the coming years

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,800
here are some doubling timelines that we

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,940
might expect or prefer

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,480
so that does help set the stage

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,640
um for chapter

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,179
six

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,900
um

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,239
anyone else you just unmute or just

56
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,580
raise your hand

57
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,640
chapter six is a recipe for building

58
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,780
active inference models so it's not the

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,519
uh

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,180
fast food restaurant yet but it's a

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,379
recipe

62
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,379
for the home and potentially industrial

63
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,599
chef

64
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,459
it covers the essential steps to design

65
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,019
an effective model

66
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,300
and that is going to be taken in like a

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,440
staged way

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,920
um

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,959
and

70
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,819
starts on page

71
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,000
105 in the textbook so

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,239
shall we look at the questions does

73
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
anyone have a specific question they

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,980
would like to jump to or any general

75
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,819
points

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,239
otherwise let's look at the recipe

77
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,739
and then

78
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,840
see if there's things that we can add

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,120
and then in this active inference model

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,340
recipe

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,180
um

82
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,700
let's

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,799
see if we can flesh it out with what

84
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
we're seeing and learning

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,299
from doing modeling

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,100
and also how it's similar and difference

87
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,440
from

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,060
other modeling recipes

89
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,419
how different is this than doing a

90
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,280
linear regression model how different is

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
it than doing some other type of

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,000
modeling or analysis

93
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,020
give me six chapters to model active

94
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,240
inference and I'll spend the first four

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,699
on the generative model

96
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,540
Carl Lincoln

97
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,479
which system are we modeling

98
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,100
what is the appropriate form for the

99
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,660
generative model

100
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,000
how to set up a generative model how to

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,620
set up a generative process so those

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,320
have been copied out here

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,220
does anyone just want to give some

104
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,340
comments on these stages or how it one

105
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,220
just Briefly summarize

106
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,440
what each of these four stages are and

107
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,580
what they do

108
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,699
or just any feature about these four

109
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,479
steps

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,919
I guess one thing is they need to be

111
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,240
discrete

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,180
these steps

113
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,620
um and that's

114
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,900
already a decision that needs to be made

115
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,759
do you mean the steps are separate from

116
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,900
each other

117
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,400
yeah

118
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,820
and we need to have categories let's um

119
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,639
if we if we have these um hidden states

120
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,100
in the Markov model

121
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,780
um these are

122
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,739
separate states

123
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,600
and um

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,979
I guess that's a

125
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,319
it's a kind of a problem and a

126
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,160
restriction also

127
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,400
are there other modeling approaches that

128
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,900
you think

129
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,160
don't have such restriction

130
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,400
yeah for instance in neural networks

131
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,520
um

132
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,520
these Transformer models where you can

133
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
type in whole

134
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,919
uh a whole picture for instance

135
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,180
or something like this

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,699
I may be wrong so maybe maybe there's

137
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,599
categories to

138
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,020
yes well maybe a related question is

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,160
when we specify what is a hidden State

140
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,020
and what is an observation in our

141
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,699
generative model

142
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,060
are we kind of locked into that

143
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,800
or

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,039
is it possible for

145
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,599
something like a pre pomdp

146
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,720
that describes

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,680
the structure

148
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,960
potentially this is between steps two

149
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,380
and three

150
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,960
like the hidden state is going to be an

151
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,318
image

152
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,960
and then it gets set up with a certain

153
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,859
dimensionality

154
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,220
foreign

155
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,179
can raise their hand let's just

156
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,399
look through the questions see which

157
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,099
what we can bring into the modeling page

158
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,200
and um

159
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,380
like which ones are remaining to be

160
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,720
needed why is modeling of the generative

161
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,820
process a necessary step for building an

162
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,680
active inference model

163
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,279
okay we have a lot of notes on here what

164
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,800
would somebody just give on a first pass

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
why is the generative process a

166
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,040
necessary step for building active

167
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,640
inference model

168
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,220
I guess on a very high level

169
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,260
um because the generative model is

170
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,120
ultimately creating a representation of

171
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
the generative process

172
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,200
if we want to create that model we have

173
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
to

174
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,140
allow for the generative model to be

175
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,580
able

176
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,820
to model the generative process so we

177
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,080
also need to model the generative

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,440
process

179
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,959
yeah

180
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,899
one aspect there is the generative model

181
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,860
is or the general process is providing

182
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,680
the observations

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
and then the sort of

184
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,300
the second layer on that is the

185
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,740
generative model

186
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,080
is working with or is building

187
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,600
representations or is a good regulator

188
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,440
of or is needing to maintain the

189
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,779
requisite diversity to deal with the

190
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,279
generative process

191
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,580
so it would be like asking why is

192
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,120
modeling of the grid important in a net

193
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,640
logo agent-based simulation

194
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,320
it's like well you got two kinds of

195
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,220
things

196
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,440
the agents moving around the grid and

197
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,880
you have the grid

198
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,860
so in this

199
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,680
active inference particular partition

200
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,080
we have the generative model that's the

201
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,580
active entity

202
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,580
and then we have the generative process

203
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,820
which could be another active entity

204
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,480
or it can have any structure

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,019
so like in model stream 7.2

206
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,440
the generative model was an active agent

207
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,019
the generative process was just an if

208
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,380
then logic

209
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,880
Ali

210
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,839
I also think that these

211
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
uh distinctive steps that have been

212
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,200
outlined here in this chapter as a

213
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,300
recipe to designing

214
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,700
um any active inference model are not

215
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,540
necessarily uh are not specifically

216
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,240
distinct or even sequential steps

217
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,899
because uh for example in the first step

218
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,899
it says which system are we modeling

219
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,300
but on the other hand the choice of

220
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,680
sorry

221
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,480
the choice of the system that we're

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,399
modeling would inevitably uh would it

223
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,940
have an effect on how on the type of the

224
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,760
generative model or the the type of the

225
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,459
general the process we're dealing with

226
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,920
so in a sense all of these steps are

227
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,680
kind of intertwined into each other and

228
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,140
they're not

229
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,420
necessarily uh have to be seen as a kind

230
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,839
of a sequence in a sequential order but

231
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,339
rather in a kind of uh from a

232
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,519
hierarchical point of view we just need

233
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,779
to have which component of the modeling

234
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,899
process are we dealing with so for

235
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,060
example we can possibly Begin by

236
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,399
identifying the generative process and

237
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,860
then

238
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,620
uh look at how we can optimally

239
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,040
represent the generative process uh by a

240
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,279
suitable generative model so what I'm

241
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,180
saying is these four steps are not

242
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,440
necessarily something that uh to be

243
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,700
taken on the pace level they are just

244
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,620
laying out the the Territorial map of

245
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,500
modeling those systems and we might

246
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,100
begin from uh each of one and each one

247
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,740
of them and then

248
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,639
proceed to any other depending on the

249
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,920
situation we're involved then

250
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,180
yeah thank you it it may be

251
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,579
seen as an atemporal

252
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,839
partition

253
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,899
not necessarily the order that a

254
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,899
traditional recipe would have

255
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,120
let's let's continue on and so we can

256
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
just touch on on each of the questions

257
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,899
okay what are the four steps some of

258
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,639
this material we moved over to this

259
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,620
distinct model recipe page just so that

260
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,540
we can develop that

261
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,420
um in its own section

262
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
um

263
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,420
okay

264
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,220
what are the four steps that are being

265
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,120
addressed on that page

266
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,380
in figure 6.1 what did the

267
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,480
unidirectional and bi-directional arrows

268
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,720
mean

269
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,040
what's a thought anyone has on this

270
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,959
so

271
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,860
in a Bayesian graph the nodes represent

272
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,019
random variables and the edges

273
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,500
represents statistical influences

274
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,839
those can be represented in an

275
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,060
undirected fashion if there's no

276
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,700
arrowheads and that's a lot like a

277
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,620
structural equation model

278
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,440
like if we were dealing with linear

279
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,480
Notions of correlation Pearson

280
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,699
correlation we could make a structural

281
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,199
equation model

282
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,699
and then the edges would be like

283
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,620
correlations between two variables which

284
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,600
are undirected of course

285
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,240
in a Bayesian causality

286
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,720
framework like Judea Pearl

287
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,459
at all

288
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,620
it is possible to have a bi-directional

289
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,959
arrow

290
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,540
um which is a lot like an undirected

291
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,040
arrow

292
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
but also you can have a unidirectional

293
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,899
Arrow such that like changes in one

294
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:16,820
variable

295
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,420
cause changes in another but not

296
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,320
asymmetrically especially if you

297
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,519
consider time series information

298
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
um

299
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,300
in the work of Aguilera at all how

300
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,000
particular is the free energy how

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,420
particular work I think

302
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,199
um

303
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,720
there are several papers and and a

304
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,699
stream on it

305
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,699
they analyze

306
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,339
which topologies of the action

307
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:55,500
perception Loop have which properties

308
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,380
so one can imagine like a simple

309
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,360
cybernetic action perception Loop like

310
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,279
which we could just call like around the

311
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,920
clock so no line in the middle just

312
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,440
internal states only influence action no

313
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,600
no backwards arrow action only

314
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,060
influences internal internal onsense

315
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,260
Sense on internal and all the self loops

316
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,560
um that's like a simple Around the Clock

317
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,440
topology of the action perception Loop

318
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,600
so then we can ask all right so from

319
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,060
that around the clock

320
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,940
uh

321
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,699
causal framing

322
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:39,839
what extra edges and arrowheads exist in

323
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,120
the way that it's shown in figure 6.1

324
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,040
there are three

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,560
there's the connection between active

326
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,380
and sensory States so the blanket states

327
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,959
have an additional relationship

328
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,060
and

329
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,100
there's this somewhat interesting

330
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,660
symmetry

331
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,540
where active states have an arrow back

332
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,400
to internal States

333
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,099
and sensory states have an arrow back to

334
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,819
external States

335
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,040
frankly I am not sure to what extent

336
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,059
people are just showing representations

337
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,599
of the way that previous models have

338
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,579
shown it

339
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,199
which could be in a graphical

340
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,299
representation like this or you could

341
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,000
think of this as the adjacency Matrix of

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,740
the causal influence of the four states

343
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,179
on each other

344
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,039
like those that could be a fully

345
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,679
connected Matrix with a value in every

346
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,020
cell or it could be like just the

347
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,000
identity Matrix would be like four

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,860
states that are independently evolving

349
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,220
and not influencing each other

350
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,820
um

351
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,580
different topologies

352
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,299
of this particular partition are going

353
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,760
to have different properties

354
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,900
and I think the most General approach

355
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,419
would be to do structure learning and

356
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,360
Bayesian model selection on different

357
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,059
topologies for the action perception

358
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,480
Loop

359
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,940
so what do they mean

360
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,840
well they mean that you are

361
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,880
um

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,679
comparing models

363
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,679
with the constraints or the availability

364
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,820
for that parameter value to be non-zero

365
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,620
if you delete the arrowhead of a certain

366
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,580
kind

367
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,480
then you're basically testing models

368
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
within a restricted class where that

369
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
parameter has been fixed at zero

370
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,600
so if you want to fix the effect of

371
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,220
sensory States on external states to

372
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,299
zero

373
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,220
maybe you think that's quote unrealistic

374
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,679
so you want to fix that to zero

375
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,480
so that you have increased statistical

376
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,720
power to resolve other parameters

377
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,620
that's valid although one of the most

378
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,419
intuitive

379
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,340
um reasons to do so which is like but

380
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,200
sensory states don't influence external

381
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,700
states in the real world it's like yes

382
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,679
but that's the map territory fallacy

383
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,960
this isn't the causal structure of

384
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,220
reality

385
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,780
Ali or anyone else

386
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,940
uh actually it might be helpful to look

387
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,360
at figure two from the paper pass

388
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,580
integrals particular kinds and strange

389
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,780
things and especially the different

390
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,580
typologies of the particular kinds

391
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,220
provided there being inert particles

392
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,020
active particles conservative

393
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,900
conservative and strange particles so

394
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,559
briefly they Define inert particles as

395
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
the kind of particles or systems with no

396
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,080
active States

397
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,780
and in the in the order of increasing

398
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,039
complexity uh one uh one step further or

399
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
one uh one level

400
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,740
up would be the active particles which

401
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,840
is a particle with a non-empty set of

402
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,620
active States but then uh ultimately we

403
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,660
and also the conservative particle is a

404
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,640
is an active particle whose particle

405
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,580
whose particular States follow Paths of

406
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,179
least action but ultimately

407
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,799
we reach a kind of definition uh I

408
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,900
believe for the first time for strange

409
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,940
particles which are defined as

410
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,520
conservative particles whose activist

411
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,820
states do not directly influence

412
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,900
internal States

413
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,000
so uh this paper claims that only this

414
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,700
fourth type of particles namely the

415
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,320
strange particles

416
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,840
have the capacity uh to be a kind of

417
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,780
sentient agent or any kind of uh

418
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,440
intelligent agent depending on how we

419
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,860
Define intelligence or sentience

420
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,900
but in any case all of these kind of

421
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,480
this strange particles some some uh

422
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,820
subsumes all the other kinds of

423
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,080
particles

424
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,840
but with varying uh levels of complexity

425
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,799
uh assigned to each of them

426
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,299
thank you

427
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,179
yes

428
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,320
good connection here we see

429
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,179
um so interestingly

430
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,000
we don't see

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,299
the backwards Arrow

432
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,380
here we see the Around the Clock

433
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,980
and the intra blanket connections

434
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,440
but we're we don't have the backwards

435
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,299
Edge

436
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,059
yeah that's because uh these kinds of

437
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:57,539
strange particles uh have not been

438
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,720
developed into a fully sentient agents

439
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,700
yet so to be fully sentient is to be

440
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,240
able to actively uh influence all the uh

441
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,780
the uh the active and sensory States so

442
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,080
I believe that's why we don't have those

443
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,179
bi-directionality in this uh picture for

444
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,159
strange particles yet

445
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,840
thank you

446
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,720
yes it's almost like this is one circuit

447
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,980
diagram

448
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,039
it's like we have four

449
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,919
CPUs on our circuit board that's the

450
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,260
particular partition

451
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,440
and then how we wire

452
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,559
up the topology of the particular

453
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,820
partition

454
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,039
is like the hardware of our circuit

455
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,039
board and then what

456
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,700
the Dynamics are is like the software of

457
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,360
our circuit board

458
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,000
foreign

459
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,159
once we start mixing in these um

460
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
taxonomies of particles of increasing

461
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,840
sentience and cognitive complexity

462
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,580
and then we start mixing in the blanket

463
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,039
index like it's a big space

464
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,880
but also it's a very semantic space

465
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,260
and

466
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,580
one advantage of fep and active modeling

467
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,200
is we can develop special or reduced

468
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,039
cases of particular things

469
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,020
that are

470
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,799
sub cognitive but they're still broadly

471
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,659
considered within a cognitivist

472
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,940
framework

473
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,840
whereas something like thousand brains

474
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,820
it may be a super effective architecture

475
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,220
for inference

476
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,200
or generalization or any other number of

477
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,419
advanced cognitive tasks

478
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,679
however

479
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,400
it cannot be

480
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,940
constrained or projected down

481
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,520
to the case of like a ball rolling down

482
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,140
a slope

483
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,240
whereas Bayesian mechanics Bayesian

484
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,620
physics

485
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,360
and this

486
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,539
um taxonomy of particles

487
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,140
helps us Bridge the continuum

488
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,580
with expressive modeling framework

489
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,020
that spans

490
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,940
the simplest

491
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,659
least active particles to open-ended

492
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,640
complexity and intelligence

493
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,039
Michael

494
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,520
yeah I I also had a little bit of

495
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,000
problems with understanding this inter

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,980
um blanket uh Markov blanket Loop and

497
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,200
what that could mean

498
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,919
um

499
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,020
so there's somehow unmediated

500
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,059
action that does not have an impact on

501
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,799
the environment

502
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,740
and The Sensation

503
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,600
sensation action loop I I have problems

504
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,539
really to understand what that is what

505
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,039
that could be

506
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,419
and

507
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:19,740
um

508
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,460
I mean I can see that one can have a

509
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,140
system that produces something like this

510
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,179
but I have understanding uh problems to

511
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,159
understand so I was thinking whether

512
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,200
This was meant to be for instance a

513
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,940
reflex you hit on the knee and then

514
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,919
the leg

515
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,159
does some kind of movement

516
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,940
but without going to the brain so that

517
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,380
um

518
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,840
the nerve ends in the spine somewhere

519
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,320
and then this action is produced by uh

520
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,779
by placing the spine and and then it

521
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,039
doesn't go too

522
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,500
but it's I mean that it depends on what

523
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,799
you call an internal state right so if

524
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:06,659
the spine that triggers this reaction

525
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,520
uh not part of an internal State I I

526
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,799
well I'm I'm a little bit lost in

527
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,140
understanding what how we how we can

528
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,600
understand that yeah thank you for the

529
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,700
comments so

530
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,860
super important Point like it depends

531
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,440
what is internal States it's not like

532
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
States

533
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,940
um

534
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,779
even within a fixed like we're these are

535
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,179
the only variables on the table

536
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:34,500
um

537
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
whether one is internal or external

538
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,020
is of course whether we're choosing to

539
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,520
model it as the generative model or a

540
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,260
generative process like which side of

541
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,320
the blanket and there's a symmetry there

542
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,500
um and then it's not just like this

543
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,080
variable is an internal State it's

544
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,600
always like the four-fold particular

545
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,539
partition comes into being

546
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,100
in

547
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,600
the same time

548
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,880
like the blanket states are those that

549
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,080
make internal and external States

550
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,120
conditionally independent

551
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,080
so but that blanket state with respect

552
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,820
to X and mu

553
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,860
it might be an internal state with

554
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,480
respect to something else

555
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,580
so it does definitely depend on it and I

556
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,440
think now to the question of the

557
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,120
connection

558
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,159
here's from emperor's new Markov

559
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,340
blankets by vernberg

560
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,900
um

561
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,980
I think the edge may have to do with

562
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,020
just the

563
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,260
uh the fact that there is an arrowhead

564
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,720
doesn't mean that the parameter value is

565
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,340
non-zero

566
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,360
it just means that we're describing

567
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,880
families of models where there can be a

568
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,640
non-zero influence we're not a priori

569
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,120
fixing it to zero but you could

570
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,400
conceivably remove this Edge and just

571
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,380
fit the simple around the clock or

572
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,779
around the clock with the two backwards

573
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,980
edges

574
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,240
so because we're making models not

575
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,240
um of maps not territories

576
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,900
we don't need to be constrained to a

577
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,000
physical

578
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,520
um anatomical realism with respect to

579
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,260
what these edges are

580
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,980
and so it's easy to sort of contrast the

581
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,020
plausibility of these edges with

582
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,820
anatomical realism

583
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,820
but these are not anatomical edges

584
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,880
so it's just opening up this the family

585
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
of models under consideration

586
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
to a non-zero statistical influence

587
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,260
between these states

588
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,799
and it also May inherit from

589
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,840
um the

590
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,320
um the question of co-parents

591
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,900
and also the developments of what people

592
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,940
call a friston blanket

593
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,679
whereas the Markov blanket formalism by

594
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,000
Pearl

595
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,520
was initially characterized on an

596
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,340
undirected graph and there was only one

597
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,559
kind of blanket state

598
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,440
it was just the set of nodes that make

599
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,580
internal and external States

600
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,159
conditionally independents

601
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,840
and um you could imagine a sort of clean

602
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,659
friston blanket with like a clean

603
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,299
division of labor where

604
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,179
there's um some of the nodes in the of

605
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,799
that blanket set

606
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,200
are strictly outgoing

607
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,240
and some of the nodes are strictly

608
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,500
incoming

609
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,380
so that could happen you could buy

610
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,080
dictate Design Systems that have that

611
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,740
characteristic and that may map onto

612
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,159
a anatomical realism

613
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,720
but also you might want to consider

614
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,880
parameterizations of models that don't

615
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,860
have such a clean

616
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,320
partitioning

617
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,799
like there's a dual functional node

618
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,260
that has an incoming and an outgoing

619
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,360
statistical dependency

620
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,220
and that doesn't have to map on to any

621
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,039
actual sensor or actuator in the world

622
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,799
it's just a statistical note

623
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,918
um

624
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,580
but isn't okay I can see that one can

625
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,039
design such a system but does it make

626
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,059
sense

627
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,460
I mean if there's an infinite Loop

628
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,919
between active States and sensory states

629
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,059
that mutually manipulate themselves but

630
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,039
they have neither

631
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,580
an impact on an external world not on an

632
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,279
internal

633
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,240
how

634
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,580
of course we can assume this but what is

635
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,220
the re what is the reasoning there

636
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,200
I mean does it make sense if if

637
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,720
something happens and we cannot see it

638
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,399
and and not outside not inside but it's

639
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,820
the point

640
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
it's like just like a full turing

641
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,620
machine that generates a derivation tree

642
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,440
with huge number of internal load that

643
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,940
just disappear and one has not a track

644
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,299
of what happens there

645
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:22,200
yes thank you for the comment so I think

646
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,480
one one way to

647
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,100
think about

648
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,820
um

649
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,399
this

650
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,039
topology this wiring of the particular

651
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,000
partition here's from that um

652
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,220
uh path integrals particular kind

653
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,120
strange things paper

654
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,760
this is how we're modeling flows over

655
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,120
states in the fep

656
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,880
we have the flow over the total

657
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,640
particular partition X

658
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,299
is like a tuple there's a four unit four

659
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:03,960
four length Vector over internal

660
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,140
external sense and action States

661
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,460
and

662
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,039
the flows of each of these nodes

663
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,679
are a function of

664
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,200
if it were all by all connected so if

665
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,419
there was like an edge here

666
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,640
then you could just like the fully

667
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,340
connected model would be

668
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,419
um

669
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,340
each of the flows would be a function of

670
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,260
all four other variables

671
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,120
and and you can

672
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,720
um

673
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,299
you could write that out if you wanted

674
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,120
but importantly

675
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,940
in these bottom two the action and the

676
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,480
internal or the autonomous States

677
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,899
don't have a direct Reliance on external

678
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:49,860
States

679
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,820
the uh Etta is not in the bottom two

680
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,120
and then importantly the external and

681
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
the sense States

682
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,559
don't have a direct

683
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,260
they're not taking as an argument

684
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,679
internal States directly

685
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,059
that

686
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,419
is like the minimal

687
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,419
cybernetic constraints

688
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,120
we might be then interested in

689
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,500
constraining further

690
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,299
but and it

691
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,000
fep maybe General May apply to the to

692
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,940
the um all by all case as well

693
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,640
but this is the minimal constraint

694
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,000
that allows autonomous States

695
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,640
octave and internal

696
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,340
to be under

697
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,760
um perceptual and action selection

698
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,539
imperatives

699
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,760
we don't want to have our finger on the

700
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,019
scale

701
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:57,299
on external States or sensory States

702
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,380
directly

703
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,000
except through action

704
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,080
so in any given case

705
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,980
the topology

706
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,020
itself could be a structure learning

707
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,619
question or given a fixed apology

708
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,960
parameterizing it is is going to be the

709
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,580
question

710
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,159
but does it make sense it's like saying

711
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,839
does a given structural equation model

712
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,500
make sense

713
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,359
it just is a function of what data you

714
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,598
have

715
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
let's see if we can just touch upon

716
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,119
subsequent questions

717
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,040
is there a common good representation of

718
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,560
rubric for evaluating GM GP

719
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,140
does anyone have any thoughts

720
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,720
well

721
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,420
one approach that's not even active

722
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,579
specific is using the Bayesian

723
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,500
information Criterion

724
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,920
or its cousin the AIC the ikiki

725
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,839
information Criterion

726
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,400
and um the Bic and and basically the AIC

727
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,820
reward good fit and they penalize models

728
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,400
with more parameters so the bic is

729
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,920
widely used to

730
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,380
establish

731
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,380
the Pareto optimal trade-off

732
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,160
of model complexity and model accuracy

733
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,160
so if one is interested in like what is

734
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,839
a good generative model generative

735
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,460
process fit

736
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,700
if you just want the sheer

737
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,260
um Fitness

738
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,900
you're going to end up on the slippery

739
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,700
slope towards High dimensional

740
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,880
generative models because adding a new

741
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,700
parameters

742
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,820
appropriately strictly increases model

743
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,619
likelihood

744
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,599
because new parameters are always

745
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,880
sucking up variants that was left

746
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,040
unexplained in the noise term by

747
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,079
whatever you had previously

748
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,440
so we don't just want to Simply increase

749
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,660
the likelihood blind to all other

750
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,000
factors we want some sort of balanced

751
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,700
measure that penalizes adding more

752
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,320
parameters so that's one approach for

753
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,619
model evaluation in the Bayesian space

754
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,320
and another that is commonly used is a

755
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,099
Bayes Factor which is a relative measure

756
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,720
of

757
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,280
fit

758
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,940
amongst multiple Bayesian models

759
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,200
so the base factor is a ratio between

760
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,960
two Bayesian models

761
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,820
and so it can be used

762
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,440
um people have kind of heuristics just

763
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,980
like there are heuristics for p-values

764
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,300
not even going into the whole question

765
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,920
about p-values here

766
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,099
but there are also heuristics for Bayes

767
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,599
factors

768
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,020
whether the evidence of one model over

769
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,540
another is like substantial strong

770
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,760
decisive Etc

771
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,619
and

772
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,640
base Factor allow any models to be

773
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,440
compared with each other

774
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,540
whereas if we were in the parametric

775
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,220
modeling space

776
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,280
we would only be able to test using the

777
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,480
hierarchical ratio likelihood ratio test

778
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,260
the hlrt for parametric models

779
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,300
so for parametric models you can only

780
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,000
test nested models like if you're doing

781
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,359
an anova you can test an effective a an

782
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,740
effective B and then you can compare

783
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,000
that with whether there's an interaction

784
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,740
between a and b

785
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,200
but you would have a hard time testing a

786
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,000
model with a and b

787
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,660
versus a model with b and c unless you

788
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,060
put that into a nested parametric

789
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,740
framework

790
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,280
Bayesian statistics gives us a lot more

791
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,200
flexibility to compare models

792
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,680
so model selection evaluation comparison

793
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,480
those are

794
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,700
big areas

795
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,160
short answer we're using Bayesian

796
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,200
statistics so we have the most modern

797
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,920
tools for evaluating that

798
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,540
in a specifics it's always going to be

799
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,980
the specifics

800
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,960
but in terms of the tools for model

801
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,359
selection Bayesian statistics has the

802
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,900
best tools

803
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,560
all right how does the particular

804
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,760
partition

805
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,579
so 6.1 which we were looking at earlier

806
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,220
or the sort of Proto

807
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,560
particular partition

808
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,060
the the

809
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,220
um the dyadic partition here informal

810
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,859
relate to the pumdp in figure four three

811
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,599
what would anyone say

812
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,020
these are two common

813
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,220
figures that we see

814
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,460
but I don't see X mu U and Y

815
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,000
here

816
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,900
though interestingly

817
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,520
the X and the y in the continuous time

818
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,800
representation

819
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,920
they actually do map on

820
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,220
to the particular partition

821
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,260
and

822
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,400
um kind of with a v

823
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,460
whereas the discrete time pomdp

824
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,280
does not use this exact notation

825
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,980
what would anyone say why do we have

826
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,720
this closed

827
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,640
cybernetic

828
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,220
partition

829
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,440
but then it looks like we're moving into

830
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,200
a pomdp model with a different topology

831
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,260
I guess in the p-o-mdp model there

832
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,820
should be also

833
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,460
an arrow going backwards to the

834
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,119
beginning of the so if we and in a in a

835
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,800
state on the right side there should be

836
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,079
somehow a loop back to the beginning

837
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,640
which is your implicit somehow

838
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,660
that is called sophisticated active

839
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,740
inference

840
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,940
where in the past present and future

841
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,280
there can be an inference over the past

842
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,220
present and future

843
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,220
okay yeah so it is it is possible but

844
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,900
it's not the base case

845
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,880
yeah no yes

846
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,099
so this is uh unrolled in the time now

847
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:45,240
actually yes exactly exactly this has no

848
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,940
time

849
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,800
the particular partitions

850
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,760
are not defined in time

851
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,460
they're defined as functions of other

852
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,800
states in the partition

853
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
because what a Bayes causal graph

854
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,180
represents

855
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,740
is not

856
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,180
as a function of type

857
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,779
so it has to be put into

858
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,540
a form that allows us to explicitly

859
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,020
enumerate time and then in chapter 4

860
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,640
and then again we'll see in chapter

861
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,839
seven and eight

862
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,760
we have two ways to deal with time

863
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,960
broadly discrete time continuous time

864
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,579
discrete time

865
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,800
actually models

866
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,420
discrete

867
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,220
slices of time

868
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,680
sequentially

869
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,920
and generates parameterizations for like

870
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,320
hidden States and observations at

871
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,440
different explicit time points

872
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,960
in contrast

873
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,260
The Continuous time generative model

874
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,660
which is being shown like with these one

875
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,280
twos and threes instead of the D B and A

876
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,160
they're being shown juxtaposed in figure

877
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,680
four three to emphasize their structural

878
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,359
similarities

879
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,460
however

880
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,339
whereas the discrete time model is

881
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,740
explicitly predicting States and

882
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,680
observations at different time points

883
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,140
The Continuous time model

884
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,980
it's B Matrix equivalent

885
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,579
is not the next state but rather the

886
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,040
derivative of the states

887
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,700
and so the continuous time model has

888
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,859
more in common with a Taylor expansion

889
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,220
or a Volterra expansion or generalized

890
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,240
coordinates of motion

891
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,819
so in either case

892
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,680
pomdps

893
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,740
help us

894
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,540
focus our statistical and informational

895
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,160
power

896
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,180
on constrained sets of models

897
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,440
that

898
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,859
are not too restrictive

899
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:14,520
if we're willing to abide by certain

900
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,800
uh standard

901
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,359
modeling

902
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,300
practices like that the past can't

903
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,040
influence the future except through the

904
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
presence

905
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,480
or that like a derivative can't have an

906
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,099
influence on its second derivative

907
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,319
without influencing the first derivative

908
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,240
first

909
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,520
so under those standard modeling

910
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,140
assumptions

911
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,540
that uh

912
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,839
reduce the state space vastly

913
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,400
like one can imagine if there was 10

914
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,920
time points or 10 derivatives and you

915
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,020
did all by all you'd end up with a lot

916
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,040
of edges

917
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,960
but if you constrain it to time points

918
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,240
can only influence next time points and

919
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,740
derivatives can only influence the next

920
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,599
derivatives then

921
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,720
your model scales linearly with time

922
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,619
points or derivatives rather than

923
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,020
um Supra linearly

924
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,460
so PMT pmtp is one implementation

925
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,460
architecture

926
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,380
that generates generative models which

927
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,099
are compatible with The Continuous Flow

928
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:27,140
Bayesian physics underlying

929
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,280
just like you might have some flow or

930
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,040
field equations for electromagnetics

931
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,900
and then you have some discrete time

932
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,339
realization

933
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,740
in your simulation

934
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,000
that is the relationship

935
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,420
I I have a question huh

936
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,660
so if you say it's like a Taylor series

937
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,660
then this is a somehow deterministic

938
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,940
isn't it I mean in the beginning in the

939
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,980
Taylor series you say what functions you

940
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,180
want to decompose and then all the parts

941
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,819
are a little bit deterministic

942
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:05,760
but but is it what we were trying to

943
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,480
model here

944
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,500
or am I completely wrong

945
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,520
I mean it is a series you already I mean

946
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,460
it's maybe infinite but

947
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,300
um

948
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,619
but you know from the beginning what the

949
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,940
um

950
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,240
what they want what the individual

951
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,598
components are

952
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,099
anyone else want to give a thought on

953
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,960
that or I can

954
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,800
add something

955
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,279
well

956
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,819
it can be deterministic

957
00:46:52,819 --> 00:46:56,880
so you could have a model where for

958
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,260
example like

959
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,030
there isn't

960
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:00,359
[Music]

961
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,560
um

962
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,099
like there's an identity Matrix for a so

963
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,599
like hidden states are fully observable

964
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,700
or you could have one where the state

965
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,099
transitions are fully deterministic as

966
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,560
well in the discrete time case okay now

967
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,000
in the continuous case

968
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,680
um

969
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,520
is it deterministic well

970
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,160
from a given hidden state

971
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
you could have a deterministic or

972
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,359
non-deterministic emission of

973
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,078
observations

974
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,800
you can have probabilistic action

975
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,540
selection

976
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,180
that influences how States change

977
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,619
Through Time

978
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:47,339
and the way that they change their time

979
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,579
um could be sampled hence also not

980
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,359
deterministic

981
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,319
um

982
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,700
and I think

983
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,859
the

984
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,319
Taylor series

985
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,900
and variational inference have a lot in

986
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,119
common in that you do have to commit to

987
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,339
like a given family of distributions

988
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,380
that you're wanting to fit

989
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,420
but then within a given variational

990
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,540
family so you have some data set and you

991
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,540
say and now I'm going to fit this type

992
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,599
of distribution to it

993
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,240
you might fit that with the stochastic

994
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,579
gradient descent or there might be a

995
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,380
deterministic algorithm to fit it

996
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,900
but

997
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,220
it's a little bit too broad of a brush

998
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,680
to think about the bigger picture of

999
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,319
using these models and simply say that

1000
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,380
they're deterministic or

1001
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,380
non-deterministic

1002
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,339
I hope that makes sense because it is a

1003
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,079
very subtle

1004
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,280
question yeah okay yeah thanks

1005
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,540
like I'm wondering if you could have a

1006
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,460
non-determined like can a function have

1007
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,099
a uh stochastic derivative

1008
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,540
well I don't know but I mean somehow if

1009
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,579
we think of the environment that

1010
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,800
produces new

1011
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,680
input

1012
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,119
um

1013
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,980
and we don't know that environment

1014
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,720
then somehow on an undeterministic

1015
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,300
factor is there right

1016
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,420
yes the generative process is not shown

1017
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,720
here

1018
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,720
the generative process external States

1019
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,160
is handing observations in so the GM

1020
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,079
to kind of bring back the question it

1021
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,579
unrolls

1022
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,400
and it shows

1023
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,720
the agent's perspective

1024
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,280
this is necessary and sufficient to

1025
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,859
define the agents

1026
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,440
but here's the great unknown that's

1027
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,800
handing the observations to the agent

1028
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,200
so the GM

1029
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,599
can be seen as like the cognitive

1030
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,619
architecture of the agents

1031
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,440
it is not describing the total scenario

1032
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,220
that the particular partition is showing

1033
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,040
so that's one other difference X um this

1034
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,599
s

1035
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,520
is not the actual external States

1036
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,819
this is the agent's variational estimate

1037
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:37,619
of external States Ali

1038
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,240
I think the remark on page 24 of pass

1039
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,700
integrals paper

1040
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,180
might help to understand this issue a

1041
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,920
little bit better especially the second

1042
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,280
paragraph which says that from the

1043
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,440
perspective of an observer Behavior will

1044
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,480
appear to be fulfilling the epistemic

1045
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,540
and pragmatic imperatives afforded by

1046
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,200
expected free energy so it's basically

1047
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,680
uh the control versus planning or a

1048
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,700
homeostasis versus allostasis when we

1049
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,819
look at the inference from the point of

1050
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:17,220
view of the internal states of the agent

1051
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,540
and because only the from that

1052
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,480
perspective can we talk about reducing

1053
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,200
the generalized free energy right so

1054
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,220
uh there's a fundamental difference

1055
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,040
between looking at this agent from its

1056
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,839
internal State's point of view and

1057
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,559
looking at it from the external from the

1058
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,599
point of view of an external Observer I

1059
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,680
don't know if it makes sense but uh

1060
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,000
although they're complementary to each

1061
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,059
other but uh in a sense they're

1062
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:54,059
fundamentally different

1063
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,300
thank you and um

1064
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,660
just to to look ahead to nine though I

1065
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,140
wonder if this might

1066
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,200
be uh useful to see in six

1067
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,839
is and it relates to the map territory

1068
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,559
so here's figure 4.3 is in the middle

1069
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:19,500
we're parameterizing a PO mdp with real

1070
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,000
computers

1071
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,200
about a rat in a teammase or an ant in a

1072
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,839
colony or a cyber physical entity so

1073
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,319
we're parameterizing this pomdp

1074
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:34,079
but that pomdp

1075
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,960
is in a parameterized environment as

1076
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,140
well

1077
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:47,180
and six kind of brings us

1078
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:50,420
to that

1079
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,160
but it would be awesome to see more

1080
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,740
connective tissue

1081
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,040
between the particular partition

1082
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,520
which is where the physics

1083
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,720
is inheriting from flows on the

1084
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,819
particular partition

1085
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,400
and how that relates to this view from

1086
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,740
the inside of a cognitive agent

1087
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,380
um okay in the final

1088
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,339
um

1089
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,760
minutes of this chapter six

1090
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
okay last week I think we explored a

1091
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,940
little bit about how b and a are

1092
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,200
um two different variables they're not

1093
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,240
directly connected to each other but

1094
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,200
they kind of work as a team like B

1095
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,400
increments the hidden State along and

1096
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,900
then the hidden State emits an

1097
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,380
observation

1098
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,640
um good regulator we talked a little bit

1099
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,500
with Bronwyn at office hours we explored

1100
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,839
um good regulator theorem and

1101
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,040
cybernetics and requisite diversity

1102
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,300
um

1103
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,920
we talked about what what happens to bad

1104
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,640
regulators

1105
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,380
um we explored also in the office hours

1106
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,680
last week a little bit of the discussion

1107
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,420
around the blanket trick

1108
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,579
and about how affordance is handled in

1109
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:17,579
active and some similarities and

1110
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:22,079
contrasts with how it is handled in

1111
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,220
um

1112
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,980
other areas of like other threads of

1113
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,720
thinking in ecological psychology

1114
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,740
um

1115
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,500
in the coming

1116
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,740
second discussion on chapter six

1117
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,980
we can return to these bottom three

1118
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,520
questions

1119
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,980
temporal depth

1120
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,760
cognitive systems outside the brain

1121
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,040
and similarities and differences with

1122
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,380
active inference and other modeling

1123
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,540
any final remarks on this

1124
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,440
all right awesome I will stop recording

1125
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,880
let us take

1126
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,579
um a two minute break and then we will

1127
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,760
begin for cohort three thank you all
