1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,360
hello it's

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,600
March 1st 2023

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,900
we're in cohort 2 of the paradol

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,280
textbook group

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,920
we're in meeting 18.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,100
our first discussion on chapter eight

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,020
first

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,199
Michael if you wanted to just raise the

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,199
contacts or question that you wanted to

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,060
begin with and we'll just pick up there

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,340
you're I'm not sure if you're asking

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,559
sorry my microphone was off yes yeah so

13
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,559
uh the map territory fallacy I was

14
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,140
wondering what this is and whether you

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,840
could perhaps elaborate a little bit on

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
that fantasy

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,899
all right

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm moving it to chapter nine even

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,260
though we're in chapter eight because

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,140
we're gonna bring in uh figure from

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,840
chapter 9.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,920
um

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,140
oh you want to give a first

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,400
thought on on this

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,240
yeah sure

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,540
um actually map territory fallacy is um

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,479
one of the fallacies uh that is widely

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,000
used to sum up

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,780
um

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,299
somehow criticize a free energy

31
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,380
principle uh because uh as uh the

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,020
concept made the name of the concept may

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,520
suggest some believe that it's a kind of

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,180
fallacy to somehow

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,780
conflate the map with the territory so

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,079
by this I mean that free energy

37
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,479
principle claims that uh well we have

38
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,219
so very informally we have a map of the

39
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,160
principle or the theory or whatever and

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,220
the territory that it applies to so the

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
system or the agent that we're trying to

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,879
model but uh on the other hand by

43
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,840
claiming that the system or the agent

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,720
actually

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,040
does the kinds of inference that

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,239
recovers the map itself uh some people

47
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
believe that this kind of conflation

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
that map converts into territory or the

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,840
U vice versa is a fallacious claim so we

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,120
need to separate map from the territory

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,840
but uh in this uh recent paper on the

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,319
map territory fallacy fallacy

53
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,239
um

54
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,239
ramstead at all uh argued that actually

55
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,319
this is not a fallacy at all it is the

56
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,220
structure of these uh of the fep theory

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,440
so

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,040
in other words we're well aware that

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,019
there is a kind of uh inference as if

60
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,140
epistemology happening here so uh yeah

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,940
but

62
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,659
it's a bit more extensive they've lined

63
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,760
up

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,519
some number of arguments to defeat this

65
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,580
map territory fallacy fallacy and why

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,260
it's not fallacious at all so yeah

67
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,080
that's basically the gist of it in my

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,879
opinion

69
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,099
does it does it have to do with a

70
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,640
distinction between model and process

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,560
and the model is the

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,180
maybe the model is the map and the

73
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,420
no the other way the process is the map

74
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,720
and the model and the external world I

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,080
understand now the standard world is the

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,900
is the what is it the process is the

77
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,159
external world and the model is the

78
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,319
um I mean the generative model of the

79
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,239
agent itself right yeah it definitely

80
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,298
relates to that but on the other hand it

81
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,978
also relates to this concept of

82
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,800
self-evancing

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,639
which is

84
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,840
um

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,220
a way to describe the mechanism by which

86
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,699
uh the model in the environment and or

87
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,720
let's say the agent in the environment

88
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,120
models itself according to the

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
generative models so it's a kind of uh

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
as the name suggests a self-referential

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,160
way of modeling the system in the

92
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,639
environment

93
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,040
yes it's definitely a roller coaster and

94
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,380
not a resolved one

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,680
but still we can look to some of these

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,100
key recent works so the map territory

97
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,600
fallacy

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,040
would be

99
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
just like it's been since the classical

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,419
borgas writing

101
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,820
this realization like the map is not the

102
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,320
territory

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
kind of related like all models are

104
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,699
useful or some models are useful but not

105
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,800
are true like correlation is not

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
causation this sort of broad

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,139
space of aphorisms

108
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,620
that's basically like

109
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,660
instrumentalism isn't realism

110
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,000
as we might say it so that's the map

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
territory fallacy

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,960
would be making the fallacy that the map

113
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,639
is the territory I made a linear

114
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,580
regression between Cancer and heart

115
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,539
disease Ergo they are actually causal

116
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,740
that way

117
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,320
and when we're using octave inference

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,820
framework

119
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,300
one might be slightly more tempted than

120
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,039
the linear regression

121
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,940
to say well because I've generated

122
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,160
a model

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
that has a structure that seems to

124
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,680
articulate certain Natural Things

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,720
this is like an explanation

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,060
it might even have predictive power and

127
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,100
so that might lead somebody

128
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,800
to make this kind of a fallacy that the

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,820
map is the territory

130
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,180
um

131
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,680
then ramstead at all have kind of

132
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
agreed and Amplified

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,720
which is saying

134
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,300
actually when when you use the map

135
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,819
territory fallacy

136
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,880
to criticize the kind of cognitive

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
modeling

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,580
in the fep and Bayesian mechanics

139
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,639
you're acting fallaciously

140
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,259
and there's several angles on that

141
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,620
unpack more in the paper one angle is

142
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,600
you might be um

143
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,720
chopping off more than you want to

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,539
like you may realize it or not your

145
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,880
critique May extend to Simply all

146
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,919
quantitative modeling

147
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,400
and many people want to like

148
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,220
exercise fep

149
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,979
from the space of scientific modeling in

150
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,240
good graces

151
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,020
but then they don't want to for example

152
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,639
dismantle the architecture of using

153
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,900
statistics

154
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,680
so that's one angle which is like if you

155
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,759
actually

156
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,060
seek out the root of your descent

157
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,940
with this kind of cognitive modeling

158
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,919
you're going to be

159
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,380
cutting off a lot of what is just

160
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,280
understood to be statistical modeling

161
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
so it's like you've gone so far into

162
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
denying the map territory relationship

163
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,840
that you've actually

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,979
um biopsied more than just the fep

165
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,599
and then they go further which is that

166
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,900
um several features of the fep

167
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,020
make it the ideal model of generic

168
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,880
systems in statistical physics which is

169
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,620
a bit of an abstract statement so we can

170
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,780
bring it back to the textbook

171
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,940
with figure 9.1 which just as um uh

172
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,199
Michael brought up this came up in um

173
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,960
the par

174
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,960
recent bookstream with par where we we

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,879
asked what was happening

176
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,919
in this figure and and had some

177
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,958
discussion

178
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,399
um on it

179
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,080
and

180
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,479
here's the experimenter in the outer

181
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,580
shell

182
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,600
making a cognitive model

183
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
that cognitive model of let's just say

184
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,940
the rat and the teammates

185
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,459
has an aboutness

186
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,560
that reflects

187
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,339
the experimental setting and context

188
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,640
so it's making the experiments are human

189
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,580
in this outer shell is making a

190
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,459
cognitive model which is a map so all

191
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,320
the caveats of linear regressions apply

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,300
maps not the territory

193
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
don't want to fall into the map

194
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,720
territory fallacy

195
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,480
however it's also the case that that

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,959
cognitive model that map

197
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,839
is map like

198
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,620
in its relationality to the experimental

199
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,000
context

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,660
so there's this view from the outside

201
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,540
Black Box cognitive model being proposed

202
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,399
as a hypothesis

203
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,220
discrete Time chapter 7 continuous Time

204
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,160
chapter eight whatever it may be

205
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,820
but also the aboutness of that map

206
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,920
is about

207
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,440
this generative process

208
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,839
which is the generative process handing

209
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,660
stimuli to the generative model of the

210
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,040
agent

211
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
and so that duality

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,019
view from the inside and view from the

213
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,260
outside

214
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,380
makes the FTP uniquely

215
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,839
the ideal model of generic systems

216
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,000
so they're saying yeah for sure don't do

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,220
the naive fallacy

218
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,959
but don't engage in the fallacy fallacy

219
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,839
and then one final piece is if anyone

220
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,580
has a dissent with this let's just see

221
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,200
their alternative

222
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,540
let's not simply

223
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,040
tolerate

224
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
a standalone

225
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,380
criticism which is actually like a space

226
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,320
for improvement but is anyone seriously

227
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,420
proposing an alternative to this

228
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,579
structure

229
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,099
and the answer is not really Ali

230
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,740
I think it's just to add a slightly more

231
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,320
detail to uh with you what you just

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,640
explained in terms of the paper itself

233
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,200
well they actually

234
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,920
um

235
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,060
lay out two lines of arguments against

236
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,420
math territory fallacy one is a as I

237
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,760
mentioned uh the misconception that the

238
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,320
process and the model or the map and the

239
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,839
territory are conflated which they say

240
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,120
they're not actually conflated but the

241
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,880
territory behaves as if it were a map so

242
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,180
it's a kind of nested representation

243
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,300
and the other line of argument is as

244
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,660
Daniel mentioned

245
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,899
rises from a kind of misunderstanding of

246
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,579
the

247
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,079
uh

248
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,079
the kind of modeling used in statistical

249
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,620
physics and in particular the maximum

250
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,380
the principle of Maximum entropy

251
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,220
to model the environment so the way that

252
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,279
uh I mean in fep the way that agent

253
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,440
models or self evidences the environment

254
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,300
is through cmap or a constrained maximum

255
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,660
entropy principle so yeah I just wanted

256
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,480
to add those two bits of

257
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,279
detail there nice

258
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,880
Michael

259
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,880
so isn't isn't this that a map and a

260
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,160
territory implies that there is an

261
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,459
isometry between the map and the

262
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,480
territory

263
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,420
but in free energy

264
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,240
um in certain and several points they

265
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,480
claim these things are independent so

266
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,779
the the model the process and the model

267
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,300
is actually independent through these

268
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,600
Markov blankets and so on and we cannot

269
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,639
actually know what happens outside the

270
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,820
world

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,100
which is quite different from that idea

272
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,740
of map and territory

273
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,839
well great great questions I think

274
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,540
there's two there's two threads there

275
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,480
that are very tightly intertwined but

276
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,100
they're really important to to consider

277
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,079
separately so first you said is there an

278
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,200
isomorphism or an isometry

279
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,279
um

280
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,500
between the map and the territory

281
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,459
isomorphism in the strict sense meaning

282
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,680
identical structure

283
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
is not required

284
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,779
the generative process

285
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,300
even just talking about the map the

286
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,860
general process could be a continuous

287
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,779
variable and the generative model could

288
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,360
be like discrete or a binary categorical

289
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,660
variable so isometry is not even

290
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,620
required between the internal States and

291
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,040
the external States within the map

292
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,260
and then it's an even broader space

293
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,060
where you don't even know if isometry

294
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,820
even applies

295
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,459
to for example the structure of the real

296
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:03,260
territory so for sure

297
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,079
isometry or isomorphism is not required

298
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,579
some kind of

299
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,380
adaptive

300
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,120
resemblance

301
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,459
will come to be seen

302
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,380
that's like the good regulator theorem

303
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,740
from cybernetics any regulatory adaptive

304
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,459
system is as if that epistemology that

305
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,700
Ali mentioned it's as if it has an

306
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,220
effective model of its Niche again that

307
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,740
doesn't need to be isomorphic

308
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,000
but

309
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,399
Evolution or far from equilibrium

310
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,800
thermodynamics does make it the case

311
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,480
that you're going to get swept off the

312
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,160
table if you can't adapt

313
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,860
and so over generations and through

314
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,279
development it'll come to be the case

315
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,680
that there's functional

316
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,399
relationships

317
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,040
and a semiotic process

318
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,500
but it doesn't have to be astringent as

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,180
an isomorphism

320
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,760
and the second aspect was the

321
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
statistical Independence that is the

322
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,740
technical definition of a markup blanket

323
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,579
so Marco blanket it's the nodes

324
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,579
upon which two other sets of nodes in a

325
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,959
Bayesian graph are conditionally

326
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,160
independent

327
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
so the fact that we're invoking the base

328
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,180
graph right off the right off the bat we

329
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,040
know that we're talking about the map so

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,160
territories don't have Markov blankets

331
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,839
Maps do

332
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,579
so already we're within the map

333
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,040
discussion space

334
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,279
and with the Markov blanket does is it

335
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,079
precludes Direct

336
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,440
consequences direct causal impact from

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,899
internal and external States so no

338
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,300
telepathy no telekinesis

339
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,579
it's just a model constraint

340
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,079
however

341
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,139
still through the blankets there can be

342
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,139
the propagation of causal influences on

343
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,480
a base graph for example a light could

344
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,940
turn on in the generative process that

345
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,860
could shine photons onto the set State

346
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,899
and then that could update the beliefs

347
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,000
of the internal States

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,820
so

349
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,399
implications can still propagate on a

350
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,079
base graph

351
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,139
through the conditional Independence of

352
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,180
the markup blanket just like person a

353
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,399
could tell person B and then person B

354
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,139
could tell person C

355
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,360
and that doesn't mean that person a told

356
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,320
C yes Michael go for it

357
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,380
are you so you're talking about the free

358
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,440
energy principle but does it uh does

359
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,139
this apply also to the notion of maps

360
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,440
and territory as for instance we I mean

361
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,800
Google Maps for instance

362
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,880
they should have a more strict notion of

363
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,579
isometry I guess uh I'm I'm it's just a

364
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:51,839
question of what you were talking about

365
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,139
about the free energy principle or the

366
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,420
notion of maps and territory in general

367
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,620
so

368
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,100
to what extent does this metaphor do you

369
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,079
think that this metaphor really applies

370
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,418
to arbitrary depths

371
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,299
um

372
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,199
I I'm just for those who are watching

373
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,819
this video just have to like my screen

374
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,740
is like frozen so I'm just needing to

375
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,699
kind of

376
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,540
um reset the screen share but um

377
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,380
uh I mean arguably Google Maps it

378
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,179
depends on what you mean by an isometry

379
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,520
that's a two-dimensional

380
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,740
GPS landscape

381
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,620
so some kind of distorted

382
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,260
representation like making it flat

383
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,299
is done within the bounds of what's

384
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,760
useful

385
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,340
I'm not sure what what else needs to be

386
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,539
claimed for the purposes of Google Maps

387
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,059
okay and and so you're saying the same

388
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,080
also

389
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,160
applies to this uh these Markov blankets

390
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,280
and the free energy principle

391
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,360
what do you think Ali

392
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,640
again we go back again and again to

393
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,220
purses taxonomy of symbols

394
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,660
um actually Maps so

395
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,600
either I don't know Google Map or

396
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,919
circuit diagrams or these kinds of map

397
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,039
can act as a kind of icon for the object

398
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,740
instead of the index so

399
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,980
sorry I thought I got disconnected

400
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,600
um icon instead of index so an icon is a

401
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,160
kind of

402
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,940
um

403
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,600
sign that stands for the object

404
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,620
um through the relationship okay so uh

405
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,480
this kind of

406
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
um relation between the icon and the

407
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,100
object is a kind of structure preserving

408
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,780
mapping especially in the case of

409
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,559
geographical map maps or any other

410
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,280
cartographical different mappings

411
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,600
but uh in my opinion when we talk about

412
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,640
maps and territories

413
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,460
in relation with physical systems or

414
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,320
biological systems or whatever

415
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,820
we use this term in a slightly more uh

416
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,320
broader and a much more looser term and

417
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,419
it doesn't require to be an exactly

418
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,240
structure preserving mapping so it's

419
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,280
more like a mathematical mapping between

420
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,280
a mathematical relation between a sets

421
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,220
of object or sets of states and the

422
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,160
other sets of States namely generator

423
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,059
processes and the generative models so

424
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,200
that's it I mean there isn't a who need

425
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,320
any need to impose any additional

426
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,039
requirement for uh the exact structure

427
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,720
of those mappings it's a general

428
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,020
mathematical mapping per se

429
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,679
awesome yeah one other piece like from

430
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,660
the empirical practice side that I think

431
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,820
informs our philosophy of science is

432
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,200
very rarely is the empirical researcher

433
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,160
simply interested in producing

434
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,960
one final model

435
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
ing is almost always an iterative

436
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,860
process that involves the maintenance

437
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,080
and diversification and selection from

438
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,660
portfolios of models

439
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,140
so the findings of a paper might be like

440
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,880
this

441
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,760
phase space that we explored of models

442
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,059
these structural families suggest that

443
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,059
the two factors are better than the one

444
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,940
factor or that short-term memory does

445
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,000
interact with valence in this way

446
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,240
so right off the bat empirically we're

447
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,200
talking about portfolios of models

448
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,460
hence

449
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,820
there's obviously a multiple to one

450
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,559
mapping of maps to System of Interest

451
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,620
Ergo it's a bit Limited

452
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,700
to try to over interpret any map

453
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,740
and even get into this discussion of

454
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,020
whether it's actually the territory it's

455
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,539
not that's why we're doing it that's

456
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,240
statistics that's modeling

457
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,159
we have a whole host of models on our

458
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,400
computer none of them are the territory

459
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,100
but it's so tantalizing

460
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,260
because first off unlike the linear

461
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,880
regression we're talking about the

462
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,580
action perception Loop which brings this

463
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,539
sort of tangibility

464
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,799
within our grasp

465
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,659
and

466
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,179
um also there's this question of

467
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,520
language with the instrumentalism and

468
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,840
the realism

469
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,179
being mixed together

470
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,640
conceptually and linguistically

471
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,559
well the agent is minimizing free energy

472
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,059
is it though or is it the modeler's

473
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:22,559
generative model

474
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,880
of the actual embodied organism

475
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,380
so

476
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,620
somebody who knows that may be able to

477
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,200
speak or interpret flexibly and

478
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
understand that when people are talking

479
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,280
about an organism minimizing surprise or

480
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
the imperative for an organism to

481
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,880
minimize surprise

482
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,360
be able to on one hand lean into the

483
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,500
realism

484
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,780
and on the other hand lean into the

485
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,580
instrumentalism

486
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,678
but neither of those

487
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,820
I guess is like a standalone

488
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,200
interpretation or or straightforward

489
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,720
implication from any set of formalisms

490
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,240
let's go to chapter eight and let's see

491
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,679
how it plays out with continuous time

492
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,720
all right

493
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,039
as it's our um first discussion in eight

494
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,539
Let's uh

495
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,100
scan through

496
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,100
and then we'll come to the questions

497
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,720
next week

498
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,820
Okay so

499
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,179
everything flows nothing stands still

500
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,620
one of the cherished expressions

501
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,000
of

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,120
process philosophy and dynamicism

503
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,100
chapter 8 complement 7 by continuing the

504
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,080
discussion of generative models

505
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,360
chapter 7 was about discrete time

506
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,580
chapter 8 is on continuous State space

507
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,900
models

508
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,860
and it'll be brought up in multiple ways

509
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,080
that continuous time models

510
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,380
continuous perceptual models and

511
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,080
continuous action models

512
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,740
are often well suited for

513
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,620
proximate

514
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,480
generative models

515
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,000
not using a term formally but just like

516
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,580
dealing most proximally with incoming

517
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,020
sensory data

518
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,600
and on the action side dealing most

519
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,140
proximally with motor actuation

520
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,600
turns out that those

521
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,220
settings

522
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,240
often are continuous in nature like the

523
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,720
amount of pressure on a proprio receptor

524
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,640
or the amount of volume

525
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,340
by an auditory sensor

526
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,200
on the sensory sides and then on the

527
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,080
action side like the angle of an elbow

528
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
or the amount of force being exerted by

529
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,460
a muscle

530
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,280
those perceptual and motor

531
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,039
settings are really amenable to

532
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,960
continuous modeling

533
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,380
whereas discrete time models

534
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,799
are often amenable to categorical

535
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,840
symbolic and discrete settings

536
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,659
section 8.2 and just raise your hand if

537
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,100
you have like a want to add something or

538
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,360
a question 8.2

539
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,760
from chapter four

540
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,279
the generative model in continuous time

541
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,320
can be written as a pair of stochastic

542
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,799
equations determining how States hidden

543
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,659
States X generate data observables y

544
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,840
so that's the top equation is the data

545
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,279
are being generated

546
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,820
by a generator function on x hidden

547
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,419
States plus a noise term on y

548
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:55,980
and change in x x dot

549
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,860
derivative on X is a function of the

550
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,820
current state of X and V which are

551
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,360
slowly varying causes or contexts

552
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,020
plus a noise term on x

553
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,000
this is a classical formalization and in

554
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,799
the context of SPM and brain Imaging

555
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,980
this is like why is the fmri or the EEG

556
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,380
measurements

557
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,179
X are the unobserved neural States

558
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,240
neural activity Dynamics and there are

559
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,279
some sensor noise

560
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,820
and then the Dynamics of neural activity

561
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,980
which again are unobserved inferred from

562
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,740
data are a function of

563
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,539
current state of those neural activity

564
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,380
patterns and slowly varying causes which

565
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,900
might be like an attentional factor or

566
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,460
might be an experimental factor

567
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,600
and more broadly just this partition

568
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,080
into like signal and Noise

569
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,320
comes up again and again Ali

570
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,440
I just wanted to point out the the

571
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,080
second equation is also called Edo

572
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,740
stochastic differential equation so if

573
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,260
someone

574
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,020
come across that term that's exactly

575
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,080
this second equation

576
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,360
of 8.1

577
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,020
awesome

578
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,840
these stochastic calculi help us do

579
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,380
integrals and derivatives on

580
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,820
stochastic processes

581
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,360
action is absent from equation 8.1

582
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,400
this is because as outlined in the

583
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
recipe

584
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,340
action is part of the generative process

585
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,260
not the generative model

586
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,140
so this is potentially like saying the

587
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,299
consequences of action

588
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,220
are part of how things are actually

589
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,080
generated which is to say the generative

590
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,799
process even though action selection

591
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,559
is a function of a generative model

592
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,320
the consequences of action in terms of

593
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,320
modifying how the world changes

594
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,600
are occurring in the generative process

595
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,600
um

596
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
if we write down the Dynamics of the

597
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,620
real world the generative process

598
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,419
but of course this is like the Dynamics

599
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,360
of the map of the real world

600
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,279
we would have to include action so we

601
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,419
have a very similar equation but U is

602
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,679
now replaced

603
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,640
uh for V and there's bold G and F

604
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,158
um

605
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,100
this is a general formalization

606
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,039
with this sort of observable layer

607
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
caused by hidden States and the change

608
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,200
in the hidden States being related to

609
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,039
their current state and causal factors

610
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,360
so

611
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,059
they're going to specify in equation 8.3

612
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,520
a simple version that's compatible with

613
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,940
the above and noiseless

614
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,240
so it's a point attractor

615
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,279
when X is less than V the expected rate

616
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:17,520
of X is positive and vice versa so this

617
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,020
is a set point attractor

618
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,960
they're going to define a generative

619
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,940
process

620
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,320
where

621
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,659
action will change to fulfill the

622
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,659
predictions of 8.3

623
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:39,000
so this is an active movement

624
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,240
towards a point attractor

625
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,159
so that point attractor might reflect a

626
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,640
preferred Target for the eyes or a

627
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,039
preferred location

628
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:55,679
in space for a limb

629
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,880
and

630
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,700
this is going this is bringing us

631
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,539
from this totally general setting

632
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,980
into an active attainment

633
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,100
or an active agency exertion that's

634
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,600
compatible with those formalizations

635
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,200
they're going to take it one level more

636
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,860
complex

637
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,179
a more sophisticated model recognizes

638
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,220
that forces generated by muscles change

639
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,799
velocity not the position so you don't

640
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,919
just pick up and move your limb you're

641
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,720
actually modifying

642
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,779
a derivative of position which is Excel

643
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,539
Excel velocity and acceleration

644
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,279
and so here

645
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,860
we start to see a little bit of what

646
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,779
could be extended into higher and higher

647
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,100
derivatives with the generalized

648
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
coordinates of motion

649
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,820
but now f

650
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,620
of X and V

651
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,620
which is to say the function

652
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,520
that is a function of the current state

653
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,200
of the Hidden state

654
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,620
and the slowly causal uh varying factors

655
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,840
are going to be explicitly uh written as

656
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,779
this X1 is the position and X2 is the

657
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,100
velocity

658
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,039
now this generative model

659
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,399
is describing Hook's law so this is a

660
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,860
spring movement

661
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,880
with with a conservative spring

662
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,380
we can write down a general model that

663
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,640
predicts the Dynamics that wouldn't fold

664
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,200
if there was a spring drawing a limb to

665
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,059
a desired location

666
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,960
so that's like one level more advanced

667
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,380
than the uh Point attractor

668
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,380
which just linearly picks up the arm and

669
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,820
moves it to the point

670
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,000
now we have like this hooke's Law Spring

671
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,320
Force drawing and oscillating

672
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,600
and then we can imagine you can keep on

673
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,820
going you can have a damping spring and

674
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,320
so on

675
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,960
8.3

676
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,120
continuous time formalizations are well

677
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,399
suited to characterization of movements

678
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,980
and really just non-linear dynamical

679
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,059
systems

680
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,340
wherein discretization of time and space

681
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,640
is efficient

682
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,799
#livestream 52

683
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,460
discretization algorithms and

684
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,000
optimization

685
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,380
figure 8.1

686
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,480
we're returning to the spinal reflex

687
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,980
case

688
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,140
from chapter five

689
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,760
descending

690
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,559
predictions

691
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,600
getting mashed up with incoming

692
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,340
proprioceptive data

693
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,399
resulting in an error residual

694
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,419
that is modifying the trajectory of the

695
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,320
um actions in the face space shown here

696
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,539
X is the position of the limb

697
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,399
and V is where it's being drawn to

698
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,340
X is current position

699
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,740
V is the Target location

700
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,039
8.1

701
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,720
Precision attention and sensory

702
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,440
attenuation

703
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,659
we could talk more about it but this

704
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,960
related to a discussion that we had in

705
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,960
office hours last week

706
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,740
about the uh

707
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,120
sensory attenuation

708
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,360
here are some of our discussions

709
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,320
we talked about why it's relevant

710
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,299
to model

711
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,820
sensory attenuation

712
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,519
which is like the reduction of precision

713
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,980
on proprioception

714
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,519
in order to facilitate action selection

715
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,299
and that's also kind of described here

716
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,340
High precision sensor input you just get

717
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,740
shut down no movement is executed it's

718
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,460
catatonic

719
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,219
they're going to move into two classical

720
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,199
dynamical systems

721
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,780
one with

722
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,480
uh Predator prey like Dynamics lock

723
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,719
cover Volterra and the second with

724
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,418
chaotic Dynamics

725
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,520
Volterra

726
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,159
Predator prey model also called a

727
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,540
winnerless competition

728
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,739
equation 8.6 gives the lock of Volterra

729
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,820
Dynamics

730
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,659
and here on the top is the winnerless

731
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,580
competition amongst plant herbivore and

732
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,780
carnivore

733
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,940
also one could imagine this is like

734
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,320
activity patterns in the fmri OR EEG

735
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,839
with different brain regions

736
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,660
and that's exactly how it's been used

737
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,540
and here is the phase space this is like

738
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,500
three three lines plotted on time axis

739
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,300
but we can also think about that as a

740
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,180
trajectory in a three-dimensional space

741
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,040
so some sort of Cube and these there's

742
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,660
just one point

743
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,839
a b c or phc

744
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,099
that are moving in this

745
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,240
three-dimensional space on some

746
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,700
trajectory and then here if you look at

747
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,040
one side or the other of a cube

748
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,140
you can look at how there's something

749
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,040
like a a slowly drifting limit cycle

750
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,619
when you project down to a given axis

751
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,940
now they're going to move that

752
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,800
lockabletera winnerless competition

753
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Predator pre-dynamic into sequential

754
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,880
action

755
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,140
here's how sequential action has been

756
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,099
used

757
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,240
in iblink conditioning experiments

758
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,839
and in writing generation of sequential

759
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,060
information

760
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,119
patterns and also in the par

761
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,820
bookstream 2.1

762
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,400
there was a great discussion

763
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,060
by Thomas so he said early octave it was

764
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,260
continuous

765
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,660
it was generalized filtering and then

766
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,420
there was the engagement with action

767
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,220
people started thinking about how to get

768
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,780
sequential Dynamics

769
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,700
emergence of sequences from continuous

770
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,380
Dynamics was a key step towards

771
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,000
purposeful planning

772
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,700
that's figure 8.3

773
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,220
then it's like okay that's all good for

774
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,400
making this kind of

775
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,480
semi-regularized scribble

776
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,780
but what if you wanted actual policy

777
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,720
selection on which word to write

778
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,599
that's going to be really hard to bake

779
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,540
into a lock of ultera model

780
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,920
so

781
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,380
things moved into the explicit discrete

782
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,720
State space model with the pomdp

783
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,880
formalization

784
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,859
and that led to planning as inference

785
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,500
and all these other features and now

786
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,079
we're moving back into these hybrid and

787
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,060
hierarchical models where continuous

788
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,339
State spaces are reintroduced as a low

789
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:12,300
level of hierarchical modeling

790
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,079
um

791
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,440
8.2 learning continuous models

792
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,079
continuous State spaces are a lot like

793
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,420
discrete State spaces in discrete State

794
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,320
spaces you're basically taking a sum

795
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,300
across a finite number of entities in

796
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,099
continuous State spaces you're taking an

797
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,619
integral from here to there

798
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,180
and there are different approximations

799
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,980
that facilitate those integrals

800
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,380
the pmdp formalization of chapter 7 has

801
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,700
largely superseded the use of

802
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,380
generalized lockabletera systems in

803
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,940
active

804
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,700
but it's still extremely didactic and

805
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,900
pedagogical

806
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,160
and used in the lower levels of

807
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,079
hierarchical models

808
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,220
now they're going to move from the

809
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,260
lockableterra to the Lorenz attractor

810
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,520
system

811
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,960
which has some parameters that are

812
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,859
reflective of weather systems

813
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,020
that's been studied in the context of

814
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,220
Birdsong

815
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,839
and they're going to use the lorenza

816
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,880
tractor in the Birdsong case

817
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,520
to talk about generalized synchrony so

818
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,859
generalized synchrony doesn't mean lock

819
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,140
step synchronization

820
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,660
it means that there are entities whose

821
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,079
Dynamics are on a manifold

822
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,300
in other words their Dynamics are not

823
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,160
untethered from each other there's

824
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,180
Mutual information such that they're

825
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,980
co-ambulating on a lower dimensional

826
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,560
manifold so the Birdsong example has

827
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,060
been in multiple

828
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,920
papers

829
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,920
it's a chaotic attractor that's

830
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,980
underlying the emission of Birdsong by

831
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,640
the two birds

832
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,460
livestream 32

833
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,680
is on couples

834
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,119
chaotic systems so that's where the math

835
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,099
are unpacked the most

836
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,520
but here we can just see

837
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,980
on the right side of figure 8.5 that

838
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,800
after learning

839
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,720
there's a tightening

840
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,640
of the first and the second Bird's

841
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,859
expectations

842
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,520
towards a manifold

843
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,780
it's called singing from the same hymn

844
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,880
sheet briston's quite fond of that

845
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,680
phrasing

846
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,900
and each bird contributes sections of

847
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,240
the song and there's some interesting uh

848
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,520
connections back to sensory attenuation

849
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,820
again

850
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,980
section 8.5 goes into hybrid discrete

851
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,660
and continuous models which we've

852
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,099
basically been talking about multiple

853
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,400
times so figure 8.6 first off note that

854
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,859
the G should be connected to the pi

855
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:57,839
then note the fractal rake structure

856
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,640
we have the

857
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,560
rake here

858
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,079
figure 4.3 on the bottom

859
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,820
continuous time v x x Prime double Prime

860
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,020
and so on

861
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,200
but these continuous time models lower

862
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,359
half of figure 4.3

863
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,260
are embedded within a discrete time

864
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,720
higher level

865
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,619
a b

866
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,579
d s t minus 1 t t plus one

867
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,260
so

868
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,280
we see both parts of figure 4.3 discrete

869
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,920
time on top

870
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,660
d b a

871
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,480
past present and future

872
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,660
and now we're seeing it as a top level

873
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,920
nesting

874
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,040
continuous time lower level model

875
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,940
and here x derivative of x second

876
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,700
derivative on x

877
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,640
key difference between discrete time and

878
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,839
continuous time models

879
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,820
Michael

880
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,540
yeah I have a question what happens if

881
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,640
the embedded time frames are not fitting

882
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,359
into the upper

883
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:24,920
frame so if for instance here the lower

884
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,700
parts overlap with the um with the

885
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,619
states of the upper part so if you have

886
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,579
a time frame and maybe and

887
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,839
chopping up of time into segments but

888
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,560
the segments overlap

889
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,020
is there a possibility to model such

890
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,900
kinds of things yeah a few thoughts good

891
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,700
question the first is that the

892
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,500
continuous time model

893
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,839
doesn't make explicit predictions about

894
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:55,859
the future

895
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,020
The Continuous time model is a lot like

896
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,540
a Taylor series approximation so

897
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,640
although it embodies through the

898
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,920
generalized coordinates which are one

899
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,079
two and three shown here but could be up

900
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,880
to six or more

901
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,099
it embodies

902
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:14,099
some patterns that extend beyond the

903
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,140
presence but the continuous time

904
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,359
formalization is actually always real

905
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,700
Time That's one answer

906
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,839
a more empirical answer is if you have a

907
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:25,680
model

908
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,660
where

909
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,880
um there's like sort of clashing time

910
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,380
scales

911
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,700
you're going to end up with

912
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,619
multicollinearity

913
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,060
in fitting the data to empirical results

914
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,420
so you'll get a variety of model fitting

915
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,400
aberrations

916
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,040
because the variance is going to be

917
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,700
partitioned in a sort of

918
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,619
uh discordant way

919
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,020
so some random seed might partition a

920
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,280
lot of the variants up here and then

921
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,780
another random seed partitions it down

922
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,579
here

923
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,119
so if there's Discord and overlap you're

924
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,619
just going to end up with a headache

925
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,300
trying to get that model to be useful

926
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,839
so no one's going to stop you but that

927
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,280
doesn't mean that it's going to be an

928
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,440
effective architecture for actual

929
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,280
parameterization

930
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:21,839
so does it mean we need to squeeze

931
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,220
somehow

932
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,160
the stuff into these boxes into these

933
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,160
rectangles embedded rectangles there's

934
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,859
no not really a way to have these

935
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,280
overlapping boxes there what's the case

936
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,500
that we're thinking about because pretty

937
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,740
much here is the movement of time at

938
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,599
some click

939
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,180
and then this could be every second is

940
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,819
when the new limb location is chosen

941
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,819
and then within each second

942
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,859
there's the continuous movement of the

943
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:54,900
limb

944
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,300
yeah so so for instance they talk about

945
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,319
a sentence so we have words and

946
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,900
sentences paragraphs um texts and so on

947
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,079
but now if you look at prosodic features

948
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,420
they may overlap with sentence

949
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,940
boundaries so you wouldn't have a kind

950
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,819
of pause structure that is fits into the

951
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,339
sentence structure there could be two

952
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:18,720
different

953
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,300
ways of chopping up the sentence in in

954
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,420
acoustic way and

955
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,660
um well in a you know in in terms of

956
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,420
words and sentences and so on

957
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,160
I think it's a super interesting

958
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,819
question which is like this strict

959
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:42,060
nesting like well isaacades continuously

960
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,440
let's just say

961
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,660
and they're recognizing letters okay

962
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,400
letters are strictly nasty within words

963
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,720
words are strictly necessary than

964
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,940
sentences paragraphs and so on

965
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,260
and one might want to go oh and

966
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,940
paragraphs are strictly nested within

967
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,940
narratives it's like well no not

968
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,200
necessarily

969
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,260
there might be a narrative boundaries

970
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,720
that are up down left right of the

971
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,040
paragraphs so let's see it start by just

972
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,380
graphing it how you see it

973
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,960
and then let's go from there but in

974
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,040
principle it's not going to be

975
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,060
addressable

976
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,760
but when you actually write it out you

977
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,440
may discover

978
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,160
again a portfolio of model structures

979
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,040
which can be used empirically

980
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,339
to differentiate hypotheses

981
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,099
and their Maps so maybe it turns out

982
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,940
that a simpler model where prosody is

983
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,220
sentence delimited

984
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,380
is more effective because there's so

985
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,660
fewer parameters so the Bayesian

986
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,900
information Criterion favors that model

987
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,660
but that doesn't mean that prosody is

988
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,780
sentenced to Limited it means that

989
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,780
a statistical structure with sentence to

990
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,540
limited prosody was selected for

991
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,420
information theoretic purposes

992
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,000
map territory

993
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,560
but we want to say things about the

994
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,060
territory

995
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,339
so that's always the challenge we do a

996
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:09,619
regression between

997
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:12,599
foraging activity and the humidity

998
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,260
and we want to say when it's more humid

999
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,480
the ants forage more

1000
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,319
that seems like the natural thing to say

1001
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,200
and it might be our motivating question

1002
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,660
but it's always hard to remember that

1003
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,900
it's like ah higher values in the

1004
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,420
humidity measure are correlated with

1005
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,640
higher foraging activity it's like just

1006
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,500
say that foraging increases with more

1007
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,760
humidity

1008
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,099
but that is the

1009
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,680
departure point of the map territory

1010
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,279
fallacy

1011
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,040
so

1012
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,980
it's often more resolvable than people

1013
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,740
want to know in the specifics

1014
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,319
that's the deflationary perspective

1015
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,560
and less resolvable than we want to know

1016
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,119
in principle

1017
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,720
Ollie

1018
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,339
and also one reason behind formulating

1019
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,740
sorry the continuous Dynamics in terms

1020
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,480
of a Taylor series is because it also

1021
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,380
Maps uh onto the lagrangian formulation

1022
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,520
of mechanics because one of the reasons

1023
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,319
lagrangian's

1024
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:29,700
mechanics is used instead of the

1025
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,060
traditional Newtonian mechanics is to

1026
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,920
just get rid of time parameters so

1027
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,760
instead of time they use momentum and

1028
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,480
also the lagrangian so we don't need

1029
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,260
time explicitly defined or described in

1030
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,900
order to account for the behavior of the

1031
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,400
trajectories or to describe the

1032
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,700
behaviors of the trajectories what all

1033
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,200
we need is this series of

1034
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,980
a successive differentiations in terms

1035
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,740
of Taylor series

1036
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,540
to be able to describe the whole

1037
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,920
behavior of the system because

1038
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,280
accounting explicitly for time parameter

1039
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,760
is much difficult to model than

1040
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,220
than describing these dynamical systems

1041
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,680
in terms of their generalized

1042
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,540
coordinates in other words they're

1043
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,280
lagrangian formulations and in the path

1044
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,500
integral formulation of fep that's

1045
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,119
basically the solution

1046
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,420
proposed by Dalton person and others to

1047
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,000
use lagrangian formulation to describe

1048
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,740
these systems nice good point

1049
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,640
um

1050
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,800
equation 8.8

1051
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,060
is describing the

1052
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,619
transformation

1053
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,560
from the discrete Target selection of

1054
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,140
the upper level of this model

1055
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,079
and the way that that is received

1056
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,260
by The Continuous time model so here the

1057
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,480
discrete time Target selection

1058
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,900
is then received by The Continuous time

1059
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,400
icicade model

1060
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,099
that is an experimental setting that has

1061
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:30,119
been studied relatively extensively

1062
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,200
here in the middle of figure 8.7

1063
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,500
we see the target selection being

1064
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,880
modeled

1065
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,980
and the cicading

1066
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,619
and here's the

1067
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,480
calling back to that spring-like

1068
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,819
movement here's like the acceleration

1069
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,500
and then the dampening

1070
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,520
as the target is fixed upon

1071
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,819
so isocating has been studied relatively

1072
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,380
extensively

1073
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,339
in the context of information driven

1074
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:04,940
continuous modeling

1075
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,540
box 8.3 is a bit of a side note

1076
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,220
on discretization so a gaussian mixture

1077
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,140
model or very related is a k means model

1078
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,200
where one takes a cluster of data points

1079
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,480
in space and asks how many clusters k

1080
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,619
fit

1081
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:30,200
this

1082
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,060
scattering of points you could just have

1083
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,119
one K with just a point in the center

1084
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,980
and then there's some variance

1085
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,599
distribution around it or you could say

1086
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,359
2K and then you can look at the error

1087
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:46,500
profiles to determine uh a adequate

1088
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,660
number of clusters

1089
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:52,079
somewhere between one cluster and one

1090
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,300
cluster per data point there's going to

1091
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,900
be a k means value that is like

1092
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,220
statistically optimal

1093
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,339
8.6

1094
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,800
in this chapter which is relatively

1095
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,880
short

1096
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,740
and in some ways kind of

1097
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,579
introducing the continuous time

1098
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,339
formalism so that we can get to these

1099
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,920
important topics like Hybrid models

1100
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,500
they overview applications of continuous

1101
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,819
time GMS

1102
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,740
this is a huge topic and much has been

1103
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,800
left out see table 8.1

1104
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,260
synthetic bird song

1105
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,260
ocular motor delay conditioned reflex

1106

smooth Pursuit eye movement 2012.

1107
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:42,300
psychosis illusions 2012.

1108
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,859
cicades

1109
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:46,200
many papers

1110
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,960
action observation

1111
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,520
attention

1112
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,280
hybrid discrete continuous models

1113
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,280
self-organization

1114
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,700
it's a foundation for further

1115
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,920
exploration

1116
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,720
they focused on movement prediction

1117
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,680
it simplifies the treatment of motor

1118
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,359
control we don't need any additional

1119
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,059
Machinery or inverse models and this was

1120
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,000
also a topic picked up in the skilled

1121
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,800
performance

1122
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,800
discussion of hippolito at all

1123
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,160
talking about interactionism rather than

1124
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,559
instructionalism

1125
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,200
they talked about the lock of Volterra

1126
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,680
winnerless competition Predator prey and

1127
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,680
the lorenza tractor chaotic system in

1128
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,839
all those cases it was possible to find

1129
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:38,819
this concept of generalized synchrony

1130
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,619
which isn't lockstep but it's like a

1131
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,559
mutual information or uh manifold

1132
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,540
controversal

1133
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,260
and then they introduced the Hybrid

1134
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,160
models which tend to have continuous

1135
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,640
lower level Dynamics and discrete higher

1136
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,660
level Dynamics

1137
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,180
that's it for today next time we're

1138
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,420
going to come back to chapter nine

1139
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,460
which is going to

1140
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,099
um be talking about model based data

1141
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:14,760
analysis fitting models to data

1142
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,380
and

1143
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,260
next week uh we'll do chapter 8

1144
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,400
questions

1145
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,319
and come through it again in preview

1146
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,780
nine so

1147
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,260
thank you fellows see you next time
