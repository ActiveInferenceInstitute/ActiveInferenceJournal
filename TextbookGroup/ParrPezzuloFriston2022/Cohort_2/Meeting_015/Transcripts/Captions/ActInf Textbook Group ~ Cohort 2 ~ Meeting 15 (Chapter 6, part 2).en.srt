1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,959
hi it's February 8th 2023 we're in

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,880
meeting 15 of the octave textbook group

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
we're in our

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
second discussion in cohort 2 on chapter

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,960
six

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,760
so

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,119
last week we looked at a few

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,119
questions and

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,880
in this modeling

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,500
chapter

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,360
there's many

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,300
questions and topics we can come to so

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
does anybody want to just raise a

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,840
question or thought on six

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,700
otherwise we will look through questions

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,960
and see what we can do

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,780
yeah well I I've put a few questions

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,610
there that came to my mind

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,540
[Music]

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,680
great which one would you like to start

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,180
with

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,520
um so so we already talked about this

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,700
last time this figure 6.1

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,220
on page 110 I believe it is

25
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,280
and

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
now where is it

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,740
page 108.

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,240
and um

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,360
and my question was this vertical

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,880
connection there between active States

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,240
and sensory States and

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,900
um I was not able to really understand

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,060
why we would need to model this and I've

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,780
put this into the question there

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,259
um under chapter 6 when I read out that

36
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,500
question

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,640
so how is the mutual interaction between

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,759
active States and sensory States meant

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,460
can they mutually change their states

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,000
without impacting neither internal nor

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,239
external States so that means they cycle

42
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,180
around if yes what is supposed to what

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,520
is it to post model for instance

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,160
put their cycle around a thousand times

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,940
mutually modifying their states and then

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,099
eventually arrive at a state where they

47
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,379
change the external or internal States

48
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,940
somehow

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,120
so means my question is if they're

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,319
mutually

51
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,560
are able to change inside these Markov

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,940
blankets the states without any Trace in

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,519
the external or internal States then

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,519
they can cut a pulled or manipulate

55
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,220
themselves in to come into a situation

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,400
where suddenly they produce a Trace

57
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,620
and if this is allowed then I'm

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,060
wondering what

59
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,000
what are we supposed to Marble

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,099
with such processes

61
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,560
so

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,900
so because I mean you can then explain

63
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,360
any arbitrary Behavior

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,900
and is it is it curing complete this

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,060
kind of machine that we're then trying

66
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,680
to implement there

67
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,540
um and um and and and basically uh

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,980
and doesn't it undermine

69
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,080
explainability of behavior

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,819
so

71
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,459
I guess you got my

72
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,860
my question but maybe I'm understanding

73
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,760
something wrong there

74
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,440
anyone else want to give yes please

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,120
Ollie and then go on

76
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,340
I believe those bi-directional paths

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,040
between active States and sensory states

78
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,480
are uh simply there for the model to be

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,560
more comprehensive and

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,620
they basically refers to they basically

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,780
refer to something like reflex arcs

82
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,379
which don't necessarily need to pass

83
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,160
through cortical paths

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,459
so that's something much more directly

85
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,978
manipulated

86
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,220
but of course those

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,020
direct paths between active States and

88
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,380
sensory States could be removed from the

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,940
diagram and we we can talk about

90
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,680
bypassing internal Estates or external

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,180
States when the reflex are happen but I

92
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,740
believe

93
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,280
those direct paths are there to account

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,380
for those kinds of

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,100
um intrinsic or some somehow those

96
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,139
um

97
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,400
the behaviors akin to reflex arcs

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,660
thanks Ali but but isn't this isn't this

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,820
then uh the

100
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,860
question of what you define to be

101
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,620
internal States if you say the entire

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,300
states only start

103
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
up from a certain point above the spine

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,960
at below it's no more internal then it's

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,419
an arbitrary decision right so you could

106
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:28,259
just also say that everything that

107
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,259
happens in the hippothalamus is not part

108
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,479
of internal States and only what is in

109
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,639
the prefrontal cortexes and I mean how

110
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,020
um

111
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm I mean this is arbitrary you know

112
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,419
and if what is the reason to have such

113
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,219
kind of arbitrary decisions there

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,199
you could then put everything

115
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,680
into into this direct interaction or

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,740
depending on where your

117
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,520
yeah Yes actually it is to some degree

118
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,500
an arbitrary boundary because uh as we

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,919
also read in chapter six defining the

120
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,100
mark of blanket boundary that depends on

121
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,979
the situation we're trying to model so

122
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,400
it's not necessarily something

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,680
predefined and it depends what Behavior

124
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,560
we're trying to model so uh yeah in

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,500
sense in some sense it depends on the

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,419
context

127
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,560
and yeah

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,160
but but see my point is if we are trying

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,020
to model reflexes we would put this into

130
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,819
the internal States

131
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,120
but if we are not trying to uh I mean I

132
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,860
mean if you allow this direct

133
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,900
interaction between active States and

134
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,340
sensory States

135
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,400
you're basically

136
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,100
isn't isn't this just like saying there

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,280
is behavior that we cannot explain but

138
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,659
we want to have it in our model

139
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,580
I will give a thought but first Jacob

140
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,380
yeah I was

141
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,160
um

142
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,100
I just wanted to add that

143
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,400
you could I I think I agree with Ali's

144
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,300
point that it's probably there for

145
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,860
um more I guess

146
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,900
explainability or

147
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,759
just to kind of

148
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,900
um

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,360
owing to the fact that the active States

150
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,660
and sensory states form like a single

151
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,919
blank uh blanket but I think you could

152
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,039
also think of it as enabling another

153
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,400
loop with the internal States perhaps

154
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,560
where if the external states are very

155
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,180
high dimensional and you're in a

156
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,639
partially observable state where you

157
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,340
have like a window of observation then

158
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,800
the active states can directly change

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,139
the sensory states without necessarily

160
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,840
changing the external States it's like

161
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,940
um psychotic eye movement it's not

162
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,160
changing the external States but it is

163
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,960
changing your window of observation

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,979
through action and I think that

165
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:11,580
um

166
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,460
Carl mentioned in one of his talks that

167
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,060
um

168
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,039
these arrows might also represent

169
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,080
different levels of sophistication but

170
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm not totally

171
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,580
clear on

172
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,758
um on how that uh can be explained

173
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,099
thanks okay a few

174
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,880
um angles on this so I think the general

175
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
uh modeler

176
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,719
perspective is what some call an

177
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,820
arbitrary decision others might call a

178
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,580
model or degree of freedom so the idea

179
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,720
that just because something is

180
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
subjective or arbitrary devalues it

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
rather that is the space in which

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,300
decisions are made and so it's rarely a

183
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,560
bad thing

184
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,360
to have a broader family to choose from

185
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,220
and then

186
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,339
um let's imagine that there is oh that

187
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,380
okay second point is the particular

188
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,760
partition

189
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
which is this one so here's the particle

190
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,700
the blanket and the internal States

191
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
and then the autonomous states which are

192
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,140
the ones that were most interested in

193
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,660
developing imperatives for

194
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,140
are internal States and active States so

195
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
those are called the autonomous States

196
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,519
they're the ones like if you had total

197
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,519
control of your mind and action and you

198
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,740
had the optimal policy like you'd be

199
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,839
thinking and acting optimally

200
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
and then that leaves the sensory States

201
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,060
as being what we're trying to reduce the

202
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,660
Divergence with in terms of what we have

203
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,040
actually observed and what we expect

204
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,100
slash prefer okay so the particular

205
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,420
partitioning

206
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,880
comes into being

207
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,540
or a defined set of variables in a Bayes

208
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,380
graph

209
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,279
it's not like one variable is simply

210
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,300
internal States

211
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,260
so depending on what model you construct

212
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,720
there might be a variable might be

213
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
internal with respect to one but then

214
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,160
blanket with respect to another

215
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,519
so if we were doing an isocating model

216
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,260
like you you might be able to make a

217
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,580
base graph

218
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,740
where different things corresponded to

219
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,600
differences

220
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,459
um and then also

221
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,320
this allows us to have a model

222
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,640
where the entire cognitive behavior

223
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,740
is accomplished by the blanket

224
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,899
so you could have a model where these

225
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,399
edges with internal states do nothing

226
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,860
and that is corresponding to the the

227
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,720
strange types

228
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,180
that we talked about previously like it

229
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,579
corresponds to an inert particle that's

230
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,140
not doing anything that we might call

231
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,500
truly cognitive which is to say that

232
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,560
it's perception and action are mediated

233
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,200
entirely by its blanket

234
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,959
and so there are systems where the

235
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,060
entire performance

236
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,779
can be understood on the holograph

237
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,940
on the blanket

238
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,680
other systems

239
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,140
we might want to extend that

240
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,079
and there might be a system where this

241
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,060
Edge is parameterized from empirical

242
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,880
data to be zero or where you set this to

243
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,019
be zero

244
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,459
but another way to view this

245
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,019
um graph

246
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,440
is as a four by four Matrix

247
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,279
where the edges reflect relationships

248
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
so if it was just four independent

249
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,959
variables it would look like the

250
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,640
identity Matrix

251
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,980
and then the off diagonal elements of

252
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,140
that four by four Matrix

253
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,440
reflect the causal influence of

254
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,200
different variables on each other

255
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,180
and so you can have the Around the Clock

256
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,339
you could have the bi-directional Around

257
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,720
the Clock

258
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,820
you could have the the telepathic model

259
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,560
where there's a direct Edge between

260
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,540
internal and external

261
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,459
so

262
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,360
you could fit the full 4x4

263
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,120
but that would be equivalent to fitting

264
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,899
a linear regression with four variables

265
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,079
testing for all by all interactions

266
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,260
which you might want to do also that has

267
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,140
the least statistical power and so in

268
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,959
terms of which edges it makes sense to

269
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,440
to fix to zero removing the telepathy

270
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,959
slash telekinesis Edge

271
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,019
is a really important one

272
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,540
and then there's a few other edges that

273
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,480
are removed like internal backward

274
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,579
causing sense and external backwards

275
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,079
causing action

276
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,000
but that's not to say this is the only

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
topology of the oxygen perception Loop

278
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,699
Michael

279
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,060
yeah so I'm just wondering how well I I

280
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,459
said as I said no I'm trying I'm I'm

281
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,639
trying to apply this to our translation

282
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,940
process data so we have gaze data and

283
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,700
keystrokes and so on and there is one

284
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,480
observation in a translation that

285
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,240
the it's a mixture of of priming

286
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
processes sort of a partially

287
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
automatized processes and monitoring

288
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,060
processes where higher cognitive

289
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,380
decisions or reflective thought maybe

290
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,180
comes into play so it means that the

291
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,360
translation is a mixture of automatized

292
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,740
trans production routines and monitoring

293
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,560
intervention and I'm wondering whether

294
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,019
this model then word

295
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,300
um

296
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,279
could be used to say that these priming

297
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,980
processes are the direct links between

298
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,560
sensation and action

299
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,240
um and um and and this higher order

300
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,279
reflective processes and so somebody

301
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,180
maybe thinks of and which context

302
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,920
does the translation make sense and all

303
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,380
this whether this would then be better

304
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,800
modeled with the other route so

305
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,459
um

306
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,339
so in this case of course these priming

307
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,680
processes happen in the head somewhere

308
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,540
it's not in the spine right so

309
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,260
translator produces nevertheless uses

310
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,420
the head but there's priming processes

311
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,279
and other kinds of processes do you

312
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,560
think that makes sense to view it that

313
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,739
way

314
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,100
I think we can actually very quickly

315
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,060
run the recipe and understand

316
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,920
Ali first and then we'll come to the

317
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,040
recipe

318
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
um I think the one point that might help

319
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,440
to understand this diagram slightly

320
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,820
better is that uh in most uh most of the

321
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,699
literature related to active inference

322
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,740
nfep the word particle is used to refer

323
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,740
to the Joint set of internal States and

324
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,240
blanket States but in some other papers

325
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,519
instead of particles they use system or

326
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,500
agent so uh actually in some sense those

327
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,060
markup blankets uh belong to the to the

328
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,220
agent we're trying to model uh but

329
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,180
the reason

330
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,079
or behind distinguishing between the

331
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,899
markup blanket and internal state is

332
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,699
purely for modeling purposes

333
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,459
uh I'm not sure if it makes sense uh or

334
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:55,019
not but yeah so in any case those markup

335
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,579
blankets

336
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,320
would actually constitute parts of this

337
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,040
ancient agent were trying to model here

338
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,720
okay thank you let's just imagine just

339
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,500
rapid fire you have the most translation

340
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,019
um experience but others can like

341
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,639
imagine

342
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,160
um potentially what

343
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,560
a translation setting would be

344
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,779
so we'll just give one thought we don't

345
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,880
need to expound on all of them but we're

346
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,100
gonna focus on

347
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,279
the particular partition and then we'll

348
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,220
use that to understand like what family

349
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,199
of action perception Loops are we

350
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,000
actually fitting so

351
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,160
what question are we looking to answer

352
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,220
or what phenomena are we looking to

353
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,399
model

354
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,459
are you asking me sure what's an

355
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,660
interesting question for you or for

356
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,639
anyone about translation human

357
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,540
translation

358
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,939
yeah so we would like I guess try to

359
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,619
understand

360
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,939
translator environment interaction and

361
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,179
how translators

362
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,619
produce translations

363
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,780
what are the difficulties what are the

364
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,860
processes that goes on go on

365
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,860
difficulties

366
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,440
okay

367
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,260
which data do we have

368
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,799
we have the observations on the Markov

369
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,580
blankets so we have case data

370
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,679
reading patterns on the source and the

371
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,280
target text and we have typing Behavior

372
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,480
so the insertions and deletions

373
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,419
that happen in the texts

374
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,900
okay

375
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,799
all right

376
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,240
so

377
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,840
now we're going to go to the form of the

378
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,299
generative model as we mentioned last

379
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,740
week like it doesn't have to necessarily

380
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,620
be in this order each time

381
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,000
but

382
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
now we're going to hear no

383
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Markov blankets need to be mentioned

384
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,780
this is just empirically which data

385
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,360
exists or what are we trying to model

386
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,840
now let's think about

387
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,440
um

388
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,679
using the ontology what are the

389
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,080
particular partitions going to be

390
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,620
so

391
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,820
okay

392
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,160
the action States

393
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,380
these ones do correspond to actions that

394
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,720
you you have collected on

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,880
so we have isocades

396
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,220
which there's actually there are active

397
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,360
models of sentence comprehension

398
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,039
and type A

399
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,720
so here the isocades could be understood

400
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,200
as being selected from directions

401
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,539
that the eye can move and the typing

402
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,580
could be understood as like at the

403
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,740
letter or the word scale

404
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,860
okay what sense data

405
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,460
or sense states are going to be incoming

406
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,620
well I would I would I would put this

407
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,080
eye circuits into the sense

408
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,559
thing or the reading pattern so with an

409
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,500
eye tracker we can see

410
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,600
where the eyes are on the text so we can

411
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,860
see the the items the tokens that are

412
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,059
read so yes so the stents say could be

413
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,640
the incoming visual perception which

414
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,179
token is um being viewed

415
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,000
but the the isocate is an action

416
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,419
yeah but okay this is a policy up down

417
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,179
left right that the eye can move to

418
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,419
obtain a different sense state

419
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,000
okay so

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,100
they're describing random variables in a

421
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,080
base graph they're not necessarily

422
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,780
describing

423
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,299
um spatially separated parts of an

424
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,400
organism

425
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,320
okay now this is where there's a lot of

426
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,620
degrees of freedom in what is being

427
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,360
modeled as the internal the external

428
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,059
state so does anyone have a thought on

429
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,600
what the internal or the external States

430
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,379
might be

431
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,020
so the way we we are trying to see this

432
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,299
is that the internal States

433
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,900
can be fluent so the the person can be

434
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,240
in a steady state so they can be just

435
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,520
looking a little bit head fluently

436
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,660
translating so it's a kind of uh

437
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,080
fluent production state

438
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
exactly non-equilibrium steady state or

439
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,059
there can be in a state where they are

440
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,960
confused or hesitating we can see this

441
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,299
by the eye gaze data going back and

442
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,059
forth and the text

443
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,580
revision trying out some options and so

444
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,160
on so that's kind of a hesitation that's

445
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,799
what in internal state in my

446
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,659
understanding searching and well a kind

447
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,100
of surprise

448
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,360
uh

449
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,419
or they could be in a state where they

450
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,960
try to so what I think it's called um

451
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,240
epistemic

452
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,299
State whether or where they go ahead

453
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,240
intentionally and try to you know

454
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,100
activate the

455
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,380
correct or the appropriate mental

456
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,000
resources to be able to then use this in

457
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,820
in a translation phase in a steady state

458
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,799
does that make sense

459
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,059
okay

460
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,080
I I might put forth that fluency

461
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,900
confusion hesitation or just thinking

462
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,440
these are like categorizations

463
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,780
that you're going to be able to

464
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,620
delineate from the phase space of a

465
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,840
variable and so the question is what is

466
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,159
the variable

467
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,460
so one option but anyone feel free to

468
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,039
give a different option would be the

469
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,220
external state are the true hidden

470
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,100
semantics of the text

471
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,380
and the internal state would be the

472
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,500
received semantics of the text

473
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,380
like just thinking about

474
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,740
um numbers like we're or you know we're

475
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,620
we're doing a cooking recipe

476
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,620
but we're less fluent or We're

477
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,900
translating a cooking recipe

478
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,780
so it's three cups of sugar and two cups

479
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,700
of flour

480
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,679
we're going to be

481
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,559
engaging in isocades

482
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,320
to reduce our uncertainty about the

483
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,000
semantics of a text

484
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,720
but of course we can't directly see the

485
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,419
semantics of a text what do we get

486
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,120
incoming visual tokens

487
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,460
what do visual tokens do

488
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,679
visual tokens reduce our uncertainty

489
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,799
about the semantics what do we do now

490
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,860
that we've resolved semantics well we

491
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,260
can take actions

492
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,840
which constraining or if we didn't have

493
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,940
to type this is a complex because

494
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,559
there's like two kind of very different

495
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,179
kinds of actions but let's just say we

496
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,520
were just reading to understand so we're

497
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
doing silence translation we're just

498
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
reading and understanding something in a

499
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,679
in a language

500
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,419
so then

501
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,299
if you had sufficiently resolved your

502
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,799
uncertainty

503
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,580
about us about the the word

504
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,200
you'd imagine that you would take an

505
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,059
isocade

506
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,419
to where you expect the next piece of

507
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,640
semantics to be resolved

508
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,960
next word

509
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,860
whereas if the incoming sensory States

510
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,960
are not adequately resolving your

511
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
uncertainty

512
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,880
you might pause or you might even go

513
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,179
back

514
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,059
and then from these from patterns of

515
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:36,559
flow across the the the agent States

516
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,520
then you could categorize those into

517
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,000
categories like fluent reading hesitant

518
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,919
reading

519
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,880
distracted

520
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,919
that's one option or

521
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,159
one can imbue the model with like a

522
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,679
little bit more like a more opinionated

523
00:24:58,679 --> 00:24:59,700
model

524
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,520
where you could say an internal state is

525
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,020
going to be

526
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,039
whether they're in this or that

527
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,320
mode

528
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,220
so just to kind of summarize that

529
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,580
you can have internal States

530
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,500
reflect

531
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,000
semantics

532
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,620
and then have a secondary categorization

533
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,340
of different zones in that phase space

534
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,720
or you can have a more opinionated model

535
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,080
that is explicitly

536
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,440
modeling transitions between for example

537
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,360
fluent production and confusion

538
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,720
I need to think about this our good

539
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,480
ideas thank you yes yeah and then just

540
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
just to kind of let's just continue just

541
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,820
briefly to these last piece

542
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,799
um how would we set up the generative

543
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,480
model

544
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,299
well let's look at how they talk about

545
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,440
setting up the generative model

546
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,140
what are the variables and priors okay

547
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,740
so here was just natural language

548
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,340
so the semantics of a text so what

549
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,580
should that variable be are we reading a

550
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,760
text that's just ones and zeros

551
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
or is it is there going to be are we

552
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,700
doing genre detection and there's five

553
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,900
genre

554
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,039
or what is the actual State space

555
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,559
of different variables

556
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,440
again for typing are we going to have

557
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,419
the state space be letters

558
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,100
and then basically have like a

559
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,500
transition Matrix of letters

560
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,480
which is like some of the earliest

561
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,240
information Theory or will we have a

562
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,760
transition Matrix of words

563
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,880
or a transition Matrix of motifs

564
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,460
so those are all what some might call

565
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,799
subjective but they're modler degrees of

566
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,299
freedom there isn't the right answer

567
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,320
there's just what model is made we we

568
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,700
have actually something we call

569
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,940
activity units so we have we can chop up

570
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,400
the text into all the translation

571
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,659
process into smaller pieces where we can

572
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,539
see whether a person types or reads a

573
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,520
text or has concurrent typing and

574
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,400
reading and so we can chop up the

575
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,600
timeline into smaller units which we

576
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,779
call activity units and

577
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,600
um and then and this I think would be

578
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,980
the units on which we would like to um

579
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,299
work where so the idea here is not to

580
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,520
simulate a translation system we're

581
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,640
we're not so much interested what is

582
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
actually the text the translation being

583
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,980
produced but or say the textual elements

584
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,039
but rather the process elements so means

585
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,320
how long does it take what is the

586
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,380
interval between successive keystrokes

587
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,020
and what is the

588
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,380
um of what is the offset between gaze

589
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,020
and typing

590
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,520
typing and so on what are the gazing

591
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,400
patterns so how how long ahead do people

592
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,580
read in the text and so on so so it's

593
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,440
more the temporal structure that we want

594
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,840
to model not the

595
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,620
um

596
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,980
not the semantic structure actually

597
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,840
yes great

598
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,820
so we are not trying to simulate a

599
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,559
machine translation system

600
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,100
yep so this all right so this could be

601
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,480
simply

602
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,000
like the most coarse grained typing

603
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,500
model would be there's two affordances

604
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,600
typing or not typing

605
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,299
yes yeah and and again

606
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,039
one person could say these are

607
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,779
subjective differences between models

608
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,900
but these are the kinds of models if one

609
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,659
were to really do a research project on

610
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,820
that you could compare these three

611
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,100
models or you could say we chose to

612
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,220
pursue a model with this state space

613
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,500
for this reason or like which parts are

614
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,260
fixed and which must be learned well

615
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,779
we know that there's things that can be

616
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,539
learned by real humans but the question

617
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,580
is what is going to be fixed or learned

618
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,480
in this model

619
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,480
and fixed

620
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,679
models are simpler computationally

621
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,200
and they have a simpler interpretation

622
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,179
but sometimes the function of learning

623
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,580
then gets displaced and results in

624
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,559
distorted behavior from other parameters

625
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,820
so this is why modeling is an iterative

626
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,039
process and why it involves constructing

627
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,380
sometimes vast families of cousin models

628
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,140
to understand the stability of different

629
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,799
parameters

630
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,480
because maybe once you're you enable

631
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,880
learning on something

632
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,820
then that might change another parameter

633
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,320
because all of a sudden it doesn't need

634
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,100
to be taking on some kind of role

635
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
um

636
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,360
and then

637
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,820
uh

638
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,340
which aspects are perception like

639
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,059
which aspects are learning like

640
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,279
and then the last question is like how

641
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,159
to set up the generative process

642
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,960
interesting little hidden character

643
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,699
what are the elements

644
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,840
not sure if that's just my reader but

645
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
that's very interesting

646
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
what are the elements of a generative

647
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,179
process and how do they differ from a

648
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,220
generative model so the generative

649
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,679
process the niche it could be another

650
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,500
Octave of agent or it could just be

651
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,220
a static text

652
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,799
that passes tokens in order

653
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,360
or it could be a conversant

654
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,279
but the exact structure

655
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,220
of the state space

656
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,559
and then which families of statistical

657
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,100
distributions one chooses for priors

658
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,840
those are modular degrees of freedom

659
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,360
there won't just be one for any natural

660
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,779
system

661
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,340
in in our last third what would be

662
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,220
another good chapter six direction to go

663
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,559
thank you

664
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,520
there's a lot

665
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,000
foreign

666
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,140
the decision

667
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,059
the choice between discrete and

668
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,620
continuous models is more simply

669
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,860
articulated using discrete time models

670
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,899
okay who has a thought on why that is

671
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:52,100
that's a very good question

672
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,840
here's one possible answer

673
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
um again

674
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,039
um why is it

675
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,840
the decision to model alternative

676
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,159
futures

677
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,899
contingent on policy selection is

678
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,159
largely tied up with the choice between

679
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,380
discrete and continuous models

680
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,260
why are alternative futures more simply

681
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,179
articulated with discrete time models

682
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,179
in the discrete State space model

683
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,359
figure 4.3 as usual

684
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,099
hidden States

685
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,418
past

686
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,599
now future and I could have temporal

687
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,099
depth even further

688
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,580
but we're making an explicit prediction

689
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,659
about like

690
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,599
the hidden State at time seven

691
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,820
if we're interested in time depth of

692
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,659
seven

693
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,000
and then if we have a four two

694
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,320
affordances

695
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,320
we're evaluating all of those

696
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,000
combinatorics

697
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
every

698
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
policy which is a sequence of actions of

699
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,399
length seven for each of those policies

700
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,040
we're going to evaluate what the hidden

701
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,599
States will be

702
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,440
so you could ask under policy 22

703
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,380
up up down up up

704
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,200
what would the hidden State be and then

705
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,380
What observations might I expect

706
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,579
so the discrete State space

707
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,200
formulization

708
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,260
is amenable to talking about specific

709
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,180
moments in specific policy

710
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,460
that are under consideration

711
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,440
and then of course like those policies

712
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,420
are going to be evaluated

713
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,339
according to

714
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,480
their expected free energy

715
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,520
The Continuous time case

716
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,000
is structurally similar which is the big

717
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,079
visual message of figure 4.3

718
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,740
but note that while B in the discrete

719
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,240
time case

720
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,240
is a transition Matrix how does the time

721
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
Point move into the next time point so

722
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,780
you multiply forward with b and then

723
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,920
that's how the hidden States move

724
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,760
forward

725
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,400
and that's where policy intervenes how

726
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,099
hidden States change Through Time

727
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,920
in the continuous time case it's a lot

728
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,740
more like a Taylor series expansion

729
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,380
because node 3 here

730
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,740
is the derivative of x

731
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,359
conditioned upon X and V causes

732
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,880
and so in this case it's not that we're

733
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,280
explicitly predicting

734
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,660
at

735
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,240
five time Steps From the future if I do

736
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,619
this or that

737
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,940
but rather under a given policy that's

738
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,859
being considered

739
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,619
there's a function that's being

740
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,320
approximated with higher and higher

741
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,800
derivatives

742
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,520
so it doesn't have as straightforward

743
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,619
of an interpretation

744
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,960
you still could ask

745
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,440
under this Taylor series approximation

746
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,720
at five time steps out what's my

747
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,859
prediction so you can ask that

748
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,859
and you could even compare under

749
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,839
um derivative

750
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,280
uh

751
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
under V 1 or V2

752
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,240
two different ways of taking derivatives

753
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
we can evaluate so it's not that you

754
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,619
can't evaluate

755
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,380
the um

756
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,020
alternate Futures contingent on policy

757
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,440
selection

758
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,280
and that is exactly what happens with

759
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,260
expected free energy in continuous State

760
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,460
space models so it is possible to

761
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,140
compare alternate Futures and still use

762
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,359
expected free energy

763
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,040
but

764
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,980
only in the discrete case do we actually

765
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,440
have sequences of actions defined along

766
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,800
the way

767
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,520
so so does this mean if in the

768
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,400
non-discrete case

769
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,099
we need to look into the seventh

770
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,359
derivation to see what happens say seven

771
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,660
points in time ahead

772
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,859
no in there's a great question

773
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,440
um you could do

774
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,140
um you could do a Taylor series uh a

775
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,940
depth of one

776
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,220
so a Taylor series depth of uh with

777
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,260
approximation of one

778
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,579
see if there's a graph okay

779
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,339
okay

780
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:36,839
so let's just say we do a Taylor series

781
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,880
with one term

782
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,700
so it just is literally a flat line

783
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,859
we can look ahead any depth

784
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,520
we could look ahead a thousand time

785
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
points with a Taylor series depth of one

786
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,859
and we don't need to explicitly predict

787
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,780
those thousand time steps whereas if we

788
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,760
wanted a thousand time steps deep with

789
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
discrete

790
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,800
we would need to explicitly model every

791
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,440
single step what is the B Matrix from

792
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,740
997 to 998

793
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,119
so that's the strength and the weakness

794
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,300
of the Taylor series The Taylor series

795
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,260
you can have

796
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,599
a really simple

797
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
um approximation oh well how about two

798
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,560
terms let's do the green one

799
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,359
and you could use that two-term

800
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,740
approximation

801
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,500
any depth

802
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,780
and as you get

803
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,359
um more and more terms

804
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:31,740
they

805
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,780
just like principal component Dimensions

806
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,420
they always they always make a better

807
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,700
and better approximation

808
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,440
sometimes a lot sometimes a little but

809
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,599
you always do get better so kind of like

810
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,300
the contact zone between the true

811
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,520
function blue cosine in this situation

812
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,020
the contact Zone

813
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,660
as you do higher approximations always

814
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,300
extends out more

815
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,440
like

816
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,040
Brown peels off here purple peels off

817
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,020
here

818
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,640
and that's part of the issue is also a

819
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,980
Taylor series and just modeling General

820
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,660
you don't really know how well you're

821
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,160
doing

822
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,339
because the um the green line is not

823
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,500
going to complain oh what's the what's

824
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,079
the cosine approximation of 11 that's

825
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,300
negative 200.

826
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,680
no

827
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,720
but the model is not going to complain

828
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,500
Ali

829
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,480
possible unmute Ali

830
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,099
thank you

831
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,320
uh first of all sorry I have some

832
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,900
connection problems I'm not sure if my

833
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,320
voice is intelligible but uh one

834
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,720
interesting point is uh actually some

835
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,520
neuroscientists such as

836
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,420
rich solati and senegalia into prominent

837
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,099
Italian neuroscientists explained this

838
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:05,400
choice of actions in terms of Mosaic of

839
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,420
zones so each Zone in this Mosaic would

840
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,480
contain information about the parameters

841
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,140
that must be used to select the most

842
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,040
appropriate variant of action to act on

843
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,000
an object or

844
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,740
okay

845
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,160
okay we we did just lose

846
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,920
um a little bit we got that part

847
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,000
Mosaic of zones

848
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,619
um

849
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,900
okay let's see if we can get but um so

850
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,640
suffice to say discrete State space

851
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,619
downside

852
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,440
you have to explicitly model

853
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,060
you know the upside you get to

854
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,339
explicitly model downside you have to

855
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,980
explicitly model

856
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,540
so if you want to do temporal depth of

857
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,380
30 you need to run that out

858
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,780
across the combinatorics of policy

859
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,780
for a depth of 30. so the computational

860
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,079
complexity can be extremely high which

861
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,359
we explored in the branching time active

862
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,760
inference discussions

863
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,520
so here is like it makes a massive tree

864
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,540
search

865
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,079
so it's kind of like a chess algorithm

866
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,540
at least some chess algorithms

867
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,700
continuous State space

868
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,200
has a very very defined

869
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,900
computational complexity

870
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,460
however

871
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,400
it doesn't have the exact

872
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,420
um

873
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,500
ability to say like other than just

874
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,119
generating this smooth function you

875
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,400
can't really say too much more

876
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,260
like how would it have been different if

877
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,680
I went up up up up up down versus up

878
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,859
again

879
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,780
okay

880
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:01,859
we

881
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:02,640
um

882
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,859
Ollie we we heard you were the Mosaic of

883
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,900
zones so you could maybe

884
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,700
um add the links into the page

885
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,040
any one or two more questions that

886
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,900
people would like to come to

887
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,460
how about this one

888
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,859
what is meant by variable States or

889
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,660
observations how can States be

890
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,140
continuous

891
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,980
so States can be continuous

892
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,980
a continuous variable is like one where

893
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,500
there's a smooth knob

894
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,859
that is controlling the value so it's

895
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:03,078
like a this is like a smooth knob

896
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
could be any number between zero and one

897
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,940
it could be 0.7772

898
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:15,480
or discrete could be like zero or one

899
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,079
or it could be one two three four five

900
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,180
so that's how States can be continuous

901
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,220
um what is meant by variable

902
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,680
States or observations

903
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,200
so variables and states

904
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,900
basically mean the same thing

905
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,960
like a variable is just a it's a

906
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,160
parameter

907
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,920
in an equation or in a program

908
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,819
and variables take on States

909
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:46,800
so the variable could be continuous

910
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,140
between zero and one and then the state

911
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,359
that it's in is 0.6

912
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,460
and then observations

913
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,000
are one kind of variable

914
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,540
Michael

915
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:04,260
yeah so so how about you then model the

916
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,359
difference between the observations and

917
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:09,240
the states is is there a problem is that

918
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,099
straightforward

919
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,240
um so so if if I had have a knob and I

920
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,099
can turn it on and off so I have two

921
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:19,980
observations for that knob or I can turn

922
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,060
it you know like a demo or something

923
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,700
with infinite number of observations but

924
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,119
the knob itself

925
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,020
is just one thing so I'm not sure yeah

926
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,720
great I should understand that

927
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,319
okay so we're we're doing a volume knob

928
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,079
the nav is the territory it has like

929
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,640
physical you know it's made of metal

930
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,400
okay now there's multiple maps that you

931
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,800
could make of that knob

932
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,319
you could ask whether it's playing or

933
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,040
not

934
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,520
that would be a binary discrete space

935
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,740
you could say we're gonna do

936
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,060
um 10

937
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,760
volume levels

938
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,300
this would be discrete

939
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,380
with 10 possible States

940
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,520
or you could do a hundred

941
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,640
or you could do a continuous variable

942
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,040
any number from

943
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,819
zero to one

944
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,119
so it's like a it's a total classic map

945
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,099
territory question

946
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,960
State spaces

947
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,060
are about variables

948
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,020
variables are in the map

949
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,300
if I make a variable corresponding to

950
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,160
weight

951
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,260
like if a person

952
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,560
it could be over under a hundred pounds

953
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,319
it could be integers

954
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:50,760
it could be

955
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,400
tenths of a pound that's still a

956
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,440
discrete State space

957
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,480
it could be a continuous

958
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,960
number

959
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,440
um

960
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,119
Jonathan wrote you could then imagine

961
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,800
that observations could be discreet even

962
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,599
when States may be continuous it may be

963
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,560
that we can't tell the difference

964
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,240
between the very finely graded States

965
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,920
yes

966
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,660
great Point like just noticeable

967
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,880
difference

968
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,380
um and

969
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,119
when you do discretized models

970
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,839
it becomes like a trade-off where the

971
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,119
more coarse graining you do

972
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,700
the simpler the model is but you're

973
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,319
making bigger and bigger buckets that

974
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,880
are clumping together more and more

975
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,859
disparate things

976
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,020
whereas if you do this really fine scale

977
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,020
discretized model like hundredth of a

978
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,819
pound and we're going to be weighing

979
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,020
people

980
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,480
then you can get all these like bizarre

981
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,040
phenomena

982
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,500
where it's like well if they're 137.1

983
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
pound then this is the case but if

984
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,480
they're 137.2 then this is the case so

985
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,319
finding that optimal discretization

986
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,400
is a big Topic in optimization in

987
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,280
general and in modeling

988
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,960
um and then another piece to remember

989
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,140
the state space of the external state so

990
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,520
we're still not even talking about the

991
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,339
territory itself but the state space of

992
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,740
the external variables

993
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,420
so our

994
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,940
model of temperature

995
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,980
it doesn't have to be the same as the

996
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,619
cognitive model of the agents

997
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,660
so we could say

998
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,599
um in the simulation temperature is an

999
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,400
integer

1000
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,500
and then they're going to have three

1001
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,800
states cold just right and hot

1002
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,619
or here in the external World it could

1003
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,540
be continuous variable

1004
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,420
and then in the brain it could be three

1005
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,400
state or it could be a continuous

1006
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,700
variable or it could be anything else

1007
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,000
what matters is the observation coming

1008
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,140
in

1009
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,240
and then how that gets fit into the

1010
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,799
generative model Ali

1011
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,000
yeah apologies I got disconnected uh as

1012
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,640
I was saying some neuroscientists

1013
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,400
explain the choice of appropriate action

1014
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,420
in terms of the Mosaic of zones uh and

1015
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,020
by that they mean that each zone is the

1016
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,500
Mosaic that would contain uh the the

1017
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,800
information

1018
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,680
to act upon the affordances or the

1019
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,800
goal-directed sequences to act upon the

1020
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,579
affordances so as an example uh take for

1021
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,040
instance the task of picking up a cup of

1022
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,079
coffee uh this seemingly simple task can

1023
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,500
be done in various ways depending on

1024
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,619
whether we are drinking from it in that

1025
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:58,859
case which we would probably grasp it by

1026
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,200
the handle

1027
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,920
or if we're washing it so in that case

1028
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,780
we would probably be grasp it by the rim

1029
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,319
or moving it out of the way uh which

1030
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,800
would which in that case the grass can

1031
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,319
get by the body would probably be the

1032
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,920
more appropriate sequence of action so

1033
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,780
which of these actions is deemed

1034
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,660
appropriate for a task

1035
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,020
is worked out within that Mosaic of

1036
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,400
zones which they also

1037
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,579
correlates with some cortical areas

1038
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:36,800
which

1039
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,660
Maps those

1040
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,380
Mosaic zones quite literally in order to

1041
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,680
afford the agent

1042
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,960
this ability to pick the appropriate

1043
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,839
action in each situation

1044
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,940
thank you cool

1045
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,500
all right

1046
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,579
that is our second discussion on chapter

1047
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,859
six so six

1048
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,660
in summary

1049
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,280
outline some of the most important

1050
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,920
design choices that have been made in

1051
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,619
setting up an active inference model

1052
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,079
we have explored a lot of

1053
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,160
auxiliary routes and questions

1054
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,220
and hopefully this conveys some of the

1055
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,640
richness and excitement and openness

1056
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,980
around making a model

1057
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,680
because even for simple phenomena

1058
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,680
there's many ways to do it and even for

1059
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,000
simple phenomena it's not just about

1060
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,460
making one model and parameterizing it

1061
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,140
once it's like an iterated modeling

1062
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,760
process where you're generating these

1063
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,500
families of models

1064
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,440
they provided a recipe some guidelines

1065
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,780
and thoughts they point out that it

1066
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,819
doesn't have to be followed in that

1067
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:50,660
particular order

1068
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:52,440
this sets up the remainder of the book

1069
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,380
which puts the ideas into practice

1070
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,280
through a series of illustrative

1071
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,079
examples designed to showcase the

1072
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,940
theoretical principles presented in the

1073
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,740
first half of the book

1074
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,540
in everything that follows the only

1075
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,700
differences amongst the example rest on

1076
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,579
the design choices we have highlighted

1077
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:10,380
part two illustrates systems with

1078
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,700
different boundaries

1079
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,500
discrete or continuous Dynamics at

1080
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,540
different time scales

1081
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,839
and that will all be implementing active

1082
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:21,720
so we're going to head into

1083
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,200
chapter 7 next time

1084
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,780
chapter 7 is active inference in

1085
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,980
discrete time

1086
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,540
we're going to look at generative models

1087
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,180
that have a discrete time characteristic

1088
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,119
chapter 8 is continuous time

1089
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,040
so that distinction was kind of raised

1090
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,760
earlier in figure 4.3 chapter 7 and 8

1091
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,440
are like a pair that are going to

1092
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,599
highlight those two different

1093
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,780
possibilities chapter 9 is about data

1094
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,359
driven analysis and chapter 10 as a

1095
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,640
conclusion chapter so

1096
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,020
that concludes this session

1097
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,280
thanks everybody for the uh great times

1098
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,380
and we'll come back next week for

1099
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,599
chapter seven thank you

1100
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,260
thank you
