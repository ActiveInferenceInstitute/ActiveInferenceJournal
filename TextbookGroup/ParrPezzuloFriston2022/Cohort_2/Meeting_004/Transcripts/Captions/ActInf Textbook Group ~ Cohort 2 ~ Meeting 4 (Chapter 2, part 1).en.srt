1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,520
hello

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,419
it is

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,620
September 23rd 2022

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,620
and we are in meeting four for a cohort

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,179
two of the active inference textbook

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,139
group

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,800
we're having our first discussion of the

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,420
chapter two

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,160
of the textbook

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,180
so

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,439
before we

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,740
jump to the book and assess where things

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,840
are at with questions

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
does anyone want to provide any

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,300
overview thoughts or experiences that

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,579
they had like while reading or rereading

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,059
chapter two

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,719
just overall anything about chapter two

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,799
there's a lot of math

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,100
okay blue thank you anyone else

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,960
okay

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,460
we have this questions table and

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,680
none have added any questions

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,659
specifically for chapter two or if

25
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:34,979
someone did and put them somewhere else

26
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,960
just let us know

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,000
these are really important

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
we hope and expect and prefer that

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,439
people do have questions while they're

30
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,060
reading the text

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,340
and this is a really essential learning

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,040
practice and it helps improve our

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,780
epistemic niche

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,000
it also contributes to Future cohorts

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,979
and future Learners when we can have

36
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,619
again every single kind of question from

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,240
the directly related what does this word

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,320
mean here

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,200
to the tangential

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,060
every kind of question that people have

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,300
it's a huge service to actually just add

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,360
several of them to this table so we

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,180
don't have any for today and that will

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,640
free us up to give an overview of

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,300
chapter two walk through it and uh kind

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,580
of connect a few dots perhaps and then

47
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,560
it'd be awesome in our second discussion

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,940
of chapter two

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,160
for people to have noted down a few

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
things that they were curious about

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,220
including during this discussion people

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,620
can add directly or like write down

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,020
somewhere else and add later

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
um but this is like a really important

55
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,760
way to structure our learning

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
individually and collectively

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,540
so

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,680
um

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,019
we're going to go into chapter two

60
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,519
and

61
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,400
walk through it

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
paying attention to the formalisms and

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,980
also to a lot of the work that has been

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,900
added through the math learning group

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,480
and through various people's efforts to

66
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,040
improve the

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,760
um

68
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,480
legibility of the math because it'll be

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
like either

70
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,940
a first coat of paint or a refresher for

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,580
truly everyone so everyone's going to be

72
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,319
approaching this and trying to learn the

73
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,700
math

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,159
um in different ways

75
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,519
let's start with figure 1.2

76
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,800
this is the high road coming from the

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,819
top

78
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,819
and the low road coming from the bottom

79
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,239
chapter 2 is going to be leading with

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,500
the low road

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,560
chapter 3 is going to be presenting from

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,140
The High Road so chapter 2 is going to

83
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,319
begin with an overview of Bayes theorem

84
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,860
Bayesian statistics and then make its

85
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,140
way up through some of these terms

86
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,760
described here

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,080
and

88
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,340
reach

89
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,860
that kind of common meeting point with

90
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,720
active inference

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,580
before we flip to chapter two does

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,560
anyone have any just general comments on

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
the low road

94
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,918
okay

95
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,019
the chapter begins with this quote from

96
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,459
William James

97
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,560
my thinking is first and last and always

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
for the sake of my doing

99
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,800
what does anyone think that means or how

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,380
does it reflect on them why is it here

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
anyone can just unmute an address or

102
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
raise their hands

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
Sean

104
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,639
I suppose it's making the connection

105
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,520
between perception and action there with

106
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,320
the thinking and the doing

107
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,860
which is

108
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,120
important in chapter two

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,880
awesome

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,020
as the name active inference would have

111
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,759
it there are going to be many

112
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
connections between

113
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
cognition and inference and action like

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,780
the embodiment of Maneuvers in the real

115
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,520
embodied world

116
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,820
as well as even ways of thinking about

117
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,100
mental or cognitive behaviors as actions

118
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,759
like attention as action

119
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,880
so that will be a thread that continues

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,400
as we continue to build on active

121
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,698
inference

122
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,360
the introduction

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,979
paragraph

124
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,820
is first providing a historical View

125
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,419
that even qualitative

126
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:58,880
and

127
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,919
pre-1900 views

128
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,160
encompassed perception as an unconscious

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,479
inference

130
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,100
and as something that was being

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,460
generated subliminally and updated and

132
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,600
then kind of presented to awareness

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,300
and then

134
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,539
um the author's place the Bayesian brain

135
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,840
hypothesis as a kind of formal

136
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,380
realization of some of those models of

137
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,720
perception and action

138
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,960
and explain how active inference is

139
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,699
going to be extending those ideas by

140
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,740
doing several things

141
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,840
not just considering perception as

142
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,780
unconscious inference

143
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,380
um but also considering various other

144
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,780
cognitive features like action planning

145
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,340
learning

146
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,120
as Bayesian statistical issues in how we

147
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,380
model them

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,340
and then by finding approximations

149
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,340
and heuristics

150
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,560
that help us address problems that might

151
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,360
other be otherwise be intractable

152
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
um

153
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,198
perception as inference

154
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,819
here the Bayesian brain

155
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,539
perspective is brought up

156
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,819
and does anyone want to like

157
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,039
add anything that they've heard or what

158
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,979
the Bayesian brain kind of

159
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,120
brings up for them

160
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,599
foreign

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,680
key feature of the Bayesian brain

162
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,660
that they're going to point to

163
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,919
is

164
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,340
how it contrasts from a kind of outside

165
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,660
in

166
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,599
signal processing purely recognition

167
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,780
based model so we could think of that

168
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,160
model as being descriptive statistics

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,880
and also being compatible with frequent

170
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,199
statistics like we're getting kind of a

171
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,360
blurry picture out there and then we're

172
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,060
gonna do um descriptive statistics

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,699
frequentism and get some sort of

174
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,000
sharpened realized image like the camera

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,039
filter is a little blurry and then we're

176
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,599
just going to post process the image and

177
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,740
that's going to result in the final

178
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,860
image so it's outside in

179
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,520
um

180
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,219
in contrast and this is not novel to

181
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,839
active inference this is being described

182
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,020
as part of the Bayesian brain hypothesis

183
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,000
perceptions not a passive outside in

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
process

185
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
it is a constructive inside out process

186
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,180
in which Sensations are used to confirm

187
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,100
or disconfirm hypothesis about how they

188
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,160
were generative generative

189
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,660
um

190
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,300
the way that that plays out in Bayesian

191
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,440
inference

192
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,980
is with kind of a tale of two densities

193
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,860
density being another name for a

194
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,019
statistical distribution is like a

195
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,279
density

196
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,800
and the tale of two densities was a

197
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,680
paper Title by ramstead at all it was an

198
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,459
early live stream that we did and the

199
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,100
two densities are like the forward and

200
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,160
the reverse model which are used in

201
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,320
Bayesian statistics as well as

202
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
expectation maximization and other

203
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,380
algorithms

204
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,860
and here's what those two densities are

205
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,980
there are the density of observations

206
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,980
that's like the observables in the

207
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,640
sensory States and then there's another

208
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,920
density which are like latent States or

209
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,600
hidden states that generate those

210
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,920
observables

211
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,480
so um if we were looking at a red ball

212
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,420
then there'd be like the visual sense

213
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,820
states of the location of the ball and

214
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,560
then there'd be like a hidden stay of

215
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,260
the location of the ball so thermometer

216
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,600
giving us readings of the world and then

217
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,339
the temperature in the room which is an

218
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,720
unobservable

219
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,480
and so we can take thermometer data and

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,180
we can use that to fit a temperature

221
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,060
hidden State and also from a given

222
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,220
hidden State we could use a generative

223
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,620
model or what is sometimes referred to

224
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,600
as a forward model

225
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,820
two generate predictions about

226
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,620
observations

227
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,839
in contrast with descriptive statistics

228
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
which is taking in observables and kind

229
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,580
of distilling them and then saying well

230
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,660
the mean was 11 and the variance was 4.

231
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,160
if that's the end of the road for that

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,260
modeler that's the end of the road but

233
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,120
the Bayesian approach says okay we've

234
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,860
got a mean and a variance

235
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,940
and now we're going to be able to

236
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,720
generate data with mean 11 variance 4.

237
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,000
so that's the tale of two densities is

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
the way that these two

239
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,060
um generative

240
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,300
processes and a recognition model are

241
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,399
licked

242
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,060
to operationalize that a little bit more

243
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,320
the state of the Hidden variables

244
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,420
a priori

245
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,720
meaning before is called a prior

246
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,800
the prior is then going to be updated by

247
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
observations

248
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,459
and depending on a few factors which

249
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,839
we're going to go into

250
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,779
you can imagine one extreme case where

251
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,820
whatever observation comes in you just

252
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,519
instantly update your prior to that so

253
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,620
then it becomes a posterior like after

254
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,260
the fact but the posterior of that first

255
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,820
moment becomes the prior for the next

256
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,380
moment so it's kind of this unfolding

257
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,519
process

258
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,380
and again one extreme case would be

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,200
whatever comes in from the world you

260
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,899
just instantly update your prior to that

261
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,779
so that's like a zero memory just

262
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,540
instantly updating to that incoming data

263
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,339
point like what's the average height in

264
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,019
this classroom well this child was four

265
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,360
feet tall okay the average is four now

266
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
there's five feet okay now it's five

267
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,820
feet tall

268
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,640
The Other Extreme would be like

269
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,660
very much denoising the observations by

270
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,820
having a really stable maybe even

271
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,019
stubborn hidden State estimate

272
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,660
this relates also to attention because

273
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,180
when we pay attention to observables we

274
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,279
update our priors more when we're not

275
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,620
paying attention observables coming in

276
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,680
don't update our hidden State estimates

277
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
Bayes rule tells us how to combine

278
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
different elements the prior and the

279
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,560
likelihood

280
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,320
such that a prior probability becomes

281
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,420
transformed into a posterior probability

282
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,380
so you have some a priori estimate of

283
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,420
How likely it is to be raining at that

284
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,260
moment

285
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,019
then you're going to detect

286
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,360
wetness on your skin or not

287
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,040
and then there's going to be a posterior

288
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,060
probability update

289
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,820
Bayesian inference is a broad topic

290
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,579
and so there's many resources in place

291
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,139
to learn but it's also very important

292
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,480
thing to know in active inference

293
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,420
box 2.1

294
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,860
covers some of the underlying mechanics

295
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,420
of

296
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,180
Bayes theorem

297
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,700
um which is like very simple and taught

298
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,779
logical

299
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,360
yet very powerful in its application

300
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,540
there's an example introduced here

301
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,639
that's going to come up several more

302
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,620
times in the book

303
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,779
and does anyone want to like explain

304
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:37,860
this

305
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,180
example

306
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,339
with the frogs and the apples like what

307
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,000
is happening here

308
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,779
so the situation is that there's a

309
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:01,019
person holding something in their hands

310
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,060
and there's only two options for what it

311
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,839
could be either a frog or an apple

312
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,300
they also this is their prior belief

313
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,420
there's a 10 chance that it's a frog 0.1

314
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,620
because we scale probability

315
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,600
distributions to like a total of one

316
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,639
because something must happen

317
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,100
but a one for a statistical distribution

318
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,019
is like a hundred percent

319
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,959
so there's a 10 chance of it being a

320
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,120
frog and a 90 chance of what they're

321
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,820
holding being an apple a priori that's

322
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,279
their prior

323
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,980
then they have some sort of likelihood

324
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,639
model the likelihood model describes for

325
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,639
apples and for frogs

326
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,399
how different actions are emitted by

327
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,100
them so apples jump one percent of the

328
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,220
time that's the probability of action

329
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,160
equals jumping vertical line means

330
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,320
conditioned upon

331
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,940
so the probability of jumping

332
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,980
conditioned upon the hidden State being

333
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,199
an apple is one percent

334
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
the probability of no jump conditioned

335
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,440
on an Apple being the hidden state is 99

336
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,000
so apples rarely jump

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,480
in contrast the probability of jumping

338
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,779
observing a jump when the hidden state

339
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,500
is a frog is 81 percent and 19 for not

340
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,459
jumping

341
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,620
so a priori

342
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,320
there's a 10 percent belief that it's a

343
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,060
frog ninety percent that it's an apple

344
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,760
that's representing the uncertainty

345
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,279
around what the object is

346
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,100
then a jump is observed

347
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,500
just intuitively even without any

348
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,180
equations

349
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,579
if we know that frogs are more likely to

350
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,639
jump than Apples observing a jump

351
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,540
should increase our favor

352
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,540
of that being like a jumping object and

353
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,339
so that's exactly what happens and

354
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,380
that's what the Bayesian

355
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,260
statistics describe is a situation where

356
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,540
you have a prior belief about hidden

357
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,620
States

358
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,139
that are not directly observable

359
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,120
and you have a likelihood model of how

360
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,000
observables which is here why

361
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,540
how observables map to different hidden

362
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,139
States and then through the observations

363
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,899
you update and realize a posterior

364
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,980
belief about hidden States

365
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,800
does anyone have any thoughts or

366
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,880
questions about this

367
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,480
we're going to continue on the low road

368
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,980
this

369
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,399
is a method called exact base

370
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,680
so this is kind of like a plug and chug

371
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,759
method

372
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,180
where you can take what is described in

373
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,740
box one

374
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,320
and apply it to the values that are

375
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,759
presented here

376
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,139
and you get the exact calculation of

377
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,060
different variables depending on what

378
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,139
you're trying to find you're going to be

379
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,279
able to calculate basically every

380
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,319
variable every unknown you can kind of

381
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
isolate for and solve

382
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,319
um this is called exact base

383
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,119
exact base

384
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,559
has

385
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,220
um

386
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,900
a clear

387
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,520
intuition

388
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,220
for small state spaces so when it's like

389
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,319
there's two options there's two for

390
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,520
hidden State and two options for

391
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,619
Behavior it's quite easy to calculate

392
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,679
for large State spaces it becomes or

393
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,299
unknown State spaces it can become

394
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,460
intractable so that's going to motivate

395
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,520
some of the heuristics that are brought

396
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,179
in later

397
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
um

398
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,140
okay

399
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,059
table two again people can just please

400
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,039
raise your hands if you have any

401
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,720
thoughts or questions or want to like

402
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,419
dwell on it at a part

403
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,280
table 2.1

404
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,940
is going to be uh Brock yes

405
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,940
I just wanted to if anyone is feeling

406
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,140
like

407
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,400
um so blue

408
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,460
is she said there's a lot of math in

409
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,780
this chapter

410
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,179
and um

411
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,900
she's one of the co-workers so that the

412
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,720
prince Institute and I'm um this is my

413
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,820
second time through so

414
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,700
um if you're feeling like this is a lot

415
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,539
of math you're not alone but that's okay

416
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,980
um

417
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,559
I I just I don't know just wanted to say

418
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,500
that like it's it

419
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,940
I think

420
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,460
the way this is presented here is really

421
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,400
helpful for people that have a grasp on

422
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,980
some of the other

423
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,419
um

424
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,940
even simpler Parts like the way that you

425
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,100
made this distinction of between the

426
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,480
generative model being a thing that's

427
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,179
producing predictions and the like

428
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,980
that's a really important thing to

429
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,660
understand

430
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,720
um the Bayesian brain versus this sort

431
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
of bottom-up

432
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,639
um

433
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,960
um predictive sort of machine thing

434
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,020
um

435
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,440
part of what is happening there though

436
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,799
that I guess we're gonna get into a

437
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,880
little bit more when he's talking about

438
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,600
hidden State spaces is that um like what

439
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,179
what that all depends on

440
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,580
when he's going through this apple and

441
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,220
frog example is that there's

442
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,080
um

443
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,400
a conditional probability here that like

444
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,299
um

445
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,820
the reason that you believe that the

446
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,280
frog is jumping or whatever or not or

447
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,600
might jump is because it's a frog

448
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,840
and that may seem like

449
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,100
well

450
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,340
obviously or like so what like that you

451
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,720
know but if it's something a little uh

452
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,059
less you know I don't know contrived or

453
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,740
something like

454
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,419
um what is Brock gonna say next or

455
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,160
whatever

456
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,539
like then

457
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,179
it helps maybe to have more priors on

458
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,340
what what I'm you know and what uh

459
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I generally say you know so I I guess

460
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,440
what I'm saying I'm trying to draw some

461
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,700
attention to those conditional

462
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,220
probability it's um

463
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,780
kind of uh

464
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,080
like a simple concept but it's kind of

465
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,960
what makes that whole thing work at all

466
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,299
is that there are probabilities that are

467
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,260
kind of like

468
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,559
strongly related and it may be part of a

469
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
hidden state or whatever

470
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,020
um but that's kind of what is

471
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,700
if there weren't any conditional

472
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,460
probabilities none of this would work

473
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,539
um

474
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,900
and that's kind of the uh the magic

475
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,799
simple Secret Sauce there that's that's

476
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,740
getting traction on so

477
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,020
that's

478
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,200
helpful or more confusing but

479
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,140
thanks for the comments uh the personal

480
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,900
comments Brock and also yes the

481
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,640
conditional probability this vertical

482
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
line

483
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,400
does so much what's the probability that

484
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,100
the Giants win against the Yankees

485
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,039
well in my view it's 50 no conditional

486
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,020
upon it raining

487
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,880
maybe that doesn't matter in your

488
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,220
generative model conditional upon this

489
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,780
what if I told you that it was seven

490
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,000
nothing in the third inning

491
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,140
like

492
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,419
all these situations where information

493
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,120
comes in and there's information that

494
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,039
doesn't update our prior

495
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,799
like if you uh give a piece of

496
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,440
irrelevant information then it doesn't

497
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,120
update our prior so like conditioned

498
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,340
upon the irrelevant information

499
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,460
then we're not updating our hidden State

500
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,600
estimate

501
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,100
whereas there's other information that

502
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,200
comes in that is relevant and that's

503
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
going to have to do with the sparsity of

504
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,880
how the variables are connected and then

505
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,820
those conditional estimates help us

506
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,139
reduce our uncertainty

507
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,000
what's the overall probability that

508
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,820
somebody has this has a medical degree

509
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,280
in the world it's just the number of

510
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,200
medical degrees in the world divided by

511
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
the total population of the world

512
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,539
conditioned upon being in this situation

513
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,600
what is it and so that can be a

514
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,020
different number

515
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,380
um

516
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,159
table two one gives a little bit of a

517
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,559
statistical detail on several different

518
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,780
forms of distributions now again even

519
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,419
for people who have taken several

520
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,700
courses or even years of Statistics

521
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,539
these are not trivial Concepts

522
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,640
the piece though that we'll just

523
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,640
highlight is what a support means and

524
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,520
what surprise means support is

525
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,940
describing where that distribution

526
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,539
is even valid or definable

527
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,000
so there's some distributions like the

528
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
gaussian that have support

529
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
over all real numbers that's what the

530
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,159
fancy R means so like a gaussian the

531
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,559
kind of archetypal case is it's a bell

532
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,960
curve centered at zero and it goes off

533
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,299
to Infinity in both directions with

534
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,799
vanishingly small numbers but it has

535
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,559
support everywhere so that's the

536
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,419
gaussian

537
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,400
um in contrast there's other

538
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,799
distribution families

539
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,500
that for example can only exist on the

540
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
range between like zero and infinity

541
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,120
so that would be like waiting time

542
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,919
between events

543
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,320
it can't be a negative number so the

544
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,940
gaussian is like an inappropriate

545
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,460
distribution of family

546
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,280
to even describe situations that can't

547
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,820
be negative

548
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,059
surprise is a formula

549
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,179
that for any given observation

550
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,640
helps you determine how surprising that

551
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,460
data point is so we have the children in

552
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,440
the classroom and the average height is

553
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,840
four feet plus or minus one foot

554
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,179
and we observe

555
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,340
a new measurement and it's exactly four

556
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,480
feet

557
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
that is like the least surprising

558
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
observation possible

559
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
and then as it gets further away from

560
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,419
four like the standard deviation

561
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,799
increases

562
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,720
it's more surprising

563
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,460
and so these

564
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,960
formula

565
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,780
describe for each distribution family

566
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,780
how to calculate surprise so that's just

567
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,320
the surprise how surprising a new data

568
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
point coming in is

569
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,500
observation

570
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,960
given the Observer given the hidden

571
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,220
States as they're estimated

572
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,340
um okay so that's one notion of surprise

573
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,320
that's kind of like new data point comes

574
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,460
in

575
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,460
how surprising is it

576
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,100
there's a second notion of surprise

577
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,700
that's called Bayesian surprise

578
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,360
Bayesian surprise is how much your prior

579
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,679
moves

580
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,500
following an observation

581
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,720
so you could imagine again we have a

582
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,460
four foot estimate for the average

583
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,779
classroom

584
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,580
and data points are coming in and we're

585
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,320
surprised or not

586
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,559
that's regular surprise

587
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
Bayesian surprise

588
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,640
is the difference between the prior and

589
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,960
the posterior

590
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,059
so we could get seven foot measurements

591
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,220
again and again and again and again

592
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,260
but because we're super stubborn in our

593
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,279
prior

594
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
we're still keeping that four foot

595
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,980
estimate

596
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,539
so those data points are surprising

597
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,880
surprising surprising surprising but the

598
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,340
Bayesian surprise is zero because the

599
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,740
prior is not being updated into a new or

600
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,640
different posterior

601
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,539
um

602
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,400
that's a little bit on the difference

603
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,600
between

604
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,659
vanilla surprise naked surprise

605
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,240
and Bayesian surprise this is

606
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,679
specifically within the Bayesian

607
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,860
statistics updating framework

608
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,340
how do we how do we quantify surprise

609
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,440
well we have these formulas you just

610
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,960
plug in like the observation and some of

611
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,419
the parameters of the distribution the

612
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,880
parameters are like the values that make

613
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,159
the distribution the way it is so for a

614
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,600
gaussian there's two parameters like

615
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,460
mean and variance

616
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,679
where's the mean of the bell curve the

617
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,140
average and how wide is the bell curve

618
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,720
those are parameters surprise can be

619
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,520
calculated from the parameters of the

620
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,880
distribution and the observation

621
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,679
with these equations

622
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,039
how do we calculate Bayesian surprise

623
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,820
this is going to introduce an operation

624
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,159
that may be familiar to some or not but

625
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,919
it's it's all good it's called the KL

626
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,400
Divergence callback Library Divergence

627
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,320
and

628
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,419
this is what it looks like

629
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,059
again these are topics where one can go

630
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,760
very very deep and learn a lot so just

631
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,679
treat it like many coats of paint

632
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,240
you're going to know it's a KL

633
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
Divergence because it's dkl

634
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
just like if it was like f of x is like

635
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,860
a function of x

636
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,820
d k l brackets means that we're going to

637
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,159
be talking about a KL Divergence

638
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,460
about what's in the square brackets

639
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,260
so at this point I'm going to go over

640
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,539
the equations

641
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,240
I'm going to find equation 2.3

642
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,700
so we can see it here I'm also going to

643
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,500
open up

644
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,200
the description

645
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,960
so this is really helpful this is a

646
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,640
super important and valuable

647
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,980
contribution for people who can

648
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,159
to create natural language descriptions

649
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,960
of equations

650
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,659
because it helps get us all on the same

651
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,039
page because otherwise this is like

652
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,200
inscrutable again even for people who

653
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,760
might know the area because the notation

654
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,080
can be slightly different with different

655
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,980
letters like what is Q and so on

656
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,000
um so the KL Divergence

657
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,179
is going to be hinging upon these two

658
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,039
vertical lines

659
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,500
when it's one vertical line

660
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,940
it's going to be used in a lot of

661
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,380
different statistic situations to mean

662
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,460
conditional upon x x line Y X

663
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,279
conditioned on y

664
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,919
the two vertical lines

665
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,740
are going to be what the KL Divergence

666
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,100
is being calculated between

667
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
so this is describing the KL Divergence

668
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,520
between the Q and the P distribution

669
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,580
here's Q of X this is a function

670
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,059
here's P of X that's a function

671
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,020
um

672
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,120
specifically for Bayesian surprise we're

673
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,000
talking about the KL Divergence between

674
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,520
the prior and the posterior

675
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,059
so the KL Divergence between the prior

676
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,700
probability distribution Q of X and the

677
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,860
posterior probability distribution P of

678
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,880
x

679
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,279
and then the second part here

680
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,960
what does that mean

681
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,940
equal sign with a triangle

682
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,100
is by definition

683
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,279
that's what the triangle means on top

684
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,500
is the expectation

685
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,179
that's fancy e

686
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,760
means expectation over so it's the

687
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,960
average value of

688
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,139
Q of x

689
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,740
of

690
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,720
the natural log

691
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,539
of Q minus natural log of P this part's

692
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:49,799
a little bit less important a little bit

693
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,840
more detail but this is where we're

694
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,279
going to see it mostly written out as

695
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,980
with two vertical lines and the kale

696
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,539
Divergence is measuring the difference

697
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,580
between them if they're the same

698
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,779
distribution

699
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,240
the difference is zero if they're very

700
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,919
different the value is going to be high

701
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,960
it's kind of like how much Earth do you

702
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,159
have to move

703
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,320
to reshape the distributions to look

704
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,179
like each other

705
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,820
it's not exactly that but that's kind of

706
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,460
what a KL Divergence is

707
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,260
so

708
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,600
here we can think about the Bayesian

709
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,899
surprise of that frog Jumping Brook yes

710
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,059
um I was just gonna say I guess this

711
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,360
those details I think this natural log

712
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,100
of Q of x minus July

713
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,640
that

714
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,799
um another way to say that is that

715
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,080
that's information

716
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,559
those are uh mats or

717
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,460
like a form of bits kind of

718
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,460
um so that's the expected

719
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,740
difference of information is there zero

720
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,779
information or is there

721
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:02,100
some change in other words between the

722
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,000
the the P of X being the um prior and

723
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,299
the Q of X being

724
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,620
uh so

725
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,960
that

726
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,159
Divergence when he's about to go into

727
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,600
his his

728
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,580
that's what we're talking about is like

729
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,559
how much space is there informationally

730
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,659
between those two things

731
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,419
great so anat

732
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,659
is a unit of measurement for information

733
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:30,960
a bit is a binary bit that's zero one

734
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,779
digital computers use bits so people are

735
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,000
pretty familiar sometimes with a bit

736
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,840
a Nat is a unit that's not based around

737
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
zero one it's based around the natural

738
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,600
log and base e

739
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,539
instead of like a base 2 binary system

740
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,380
so it's monotonically related to bits

741
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,179
which is to say like they're both going

742
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,799
to go up and they're both going to go

743
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,299
down but they're not exactly comparable

744
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,799
it's like inches and feet

745
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,220
um

746
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,799
here when we were calculating just

747
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,260
regular surprise so how surprising the

748
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,820
observation is

749
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,360
that could be calculated in Nets

750
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,399
was it a surprising observation or not

751
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,340
did it did it surprise me at all that

752
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,640
that can be calculated about surprise

753
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
here

754
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,260
knots are also used to calculate the

755
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,720
informational Divergence between the

756
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
prior and the posterior when we're

757
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,600
thinking about Bayesian surprise

758
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,899
box 2.2

759
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:40,260
introduces the fancy e notation

760
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,520
fancy e is standing for expectation

761
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,559
now sometimes conversationally

762
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,279
expectation is talking about the future

763
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,840
like what do you expect the weather to

764
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,640
be tomorrow

765
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,460
in the statistical sense

766
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,320
expectation

767
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
is

768
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,480
the average expected value

769
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,000
it doesn't necessarily refer to the

770
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,260
Future

771
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,440
it could be an expectation about a

772
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,539
future time point

773
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,220
but also

774
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,600
alone

775
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,539
it is only describing basically the

776
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,399
average of a distribution

777
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,580
the expectation of a gaussian is the

778
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,580
center of the bell curve not like what

779
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,260
one believes it's going to be in the

780
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,120
future but if someone said what is the

781
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,620
expectation

782
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,620
for of your in your model for what the

783
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,380
average is going to be in 10 time steps

784
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,919
that can be addressed so it's compatible

785
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,240
with the way that people talk about what

786
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,039
do you expect to happen tomorrow

787
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:48,120
but just be aware that expectation alone

788
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,279
does not refer necessarily to a future

789
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,559
time point it's just referring to a

790
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,700
statistical average

791
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,140
and

792
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,659
um One Note again may be familiar to

793
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,220
some maybe the first time hearing for

794
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,179
some

795
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,620
but it's going to come into play in this

796
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,500
book is there are discrete State spaces

797
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,440
and continuous State spaces a discrete

798
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,379
State space is one where values can only

799
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,739
take certain like clickable values like

800
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,119
0 1 2 3 4 or it could be

801
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,500
0.1.2.3.4 but it's like there are

802
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,159
discrete values on a grid that can be

803
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,480
achieved

804
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,080
like the two options for what the thing

805
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,000
in the hand was it's a discrete State

806
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,980
space whether it's two or two million

807
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,379
it's a finite set

808
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,980
of definables and there's no in-betweets

809
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,379
in contrast continuous State spaces

810
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,199
would be like a continuous variable

811
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,480
describing the temperature

812
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,159
now one could also Describe temperature

813
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,859
with a discrete State space in my model

814
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,918
I'm describing temperature as either 20

815
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,280
21 22 23 only integer values are allowed

816
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,080
for my model

817
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,300
there's advantages

818
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,400
and there's challenges for both discrete

819
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,320
and continuous State spaces

820
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,420
and this book is going to be like

821
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,760
juxtaposing them and the chapters even

822
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
later are going to be like kind of

823
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
alternating between them

824
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,619
because there's active inference in

825
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,540
discrete situations discrete State

826
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,339
spaces discrete time and then there's

827
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,780
also active inference in continuous

828
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,400
State spaces and continuous time

829
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,660
so

830
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,859
that was very low down on the low road

831
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,560
nothing of the above was like about

832
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,599
active inference or even many of the

833
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,339
ideas that often bring people to the

834
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,020
table that was kind of like an overview

835
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,700
on some Bayesian statistical ideas

836
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,540
Bronwyn

837
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,900
this goes back a little bit though I

838
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,460
just wanted to maybe ask these questions

839
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,380
before we move on

840
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,900
one was um in relation to conditional

841
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,079
probability or the the role of

842
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,400
conditions I think Brock sort of talked

843
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,619
to it a little bit

844
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,740
um

845
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,480
is it is that with the conditional thing

846
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,980
like you know in Melbourne tomorrow

847
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,380
there's the Grand Final so you know

848
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,960
you've got two teams

849
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,820
and you said you know there's a 50 50

850
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,980
chance but it depends on what

851
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,200
what conditions

852
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,839
uh those conditions

853
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,940
are they mostly subjective I mean they

854
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,800
can be subjective

855
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,020
and they can be factual as well so

856
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,440
um yeah I suppose it's the question is

857
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,780
um the condition what what states are

858
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,160
the conditions are there they can they

859
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,200
both be well they mostly subject

860
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,599
subjective or can you have the fact that

861
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,160
frogs jump

862
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,859
as as that's what frog frogs do so that

863
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,320
that's what generally happens so that's

864
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,720
not really my subjective

865
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,780
uh opinion of frogs

866
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,720
but does my subjective opinion puts a

867
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,820
condition

868
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,160
honors does that make sense yeah great

869
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,099
question

870
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,800
these models in their Construction

871
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,380
like what their overall structure is and

872
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,960
then in their parameterization like what

873
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,140
the values are are subjective they're

874
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,820
modeler dependent

875
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,560
and so we might have different

876
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,980
perspectives on the overall likelihood

877
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,599
of one team to win

878
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,640
and then somebody might say it's going

879
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,140
to rain tomorrow or it is raining now

880
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,780
and then in your model you had that

881
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,079
that's a gonna update your prior but

882
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,119
maybe it doesn't update my prior so it

883
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,520
is even when it's like frustratingly

884
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,119
obvious it is still also subjective and

885
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,119
multi-perspectival

886
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,880
okay great

887
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,220
that's what I thought and then that

888
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,160
leads on to to the Bayesian surprise the

889
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,839
two differences between surprise and

890
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,240
Bayesian surprise

891
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,339
and that

892
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,680
how Bayesian surprise actually operates

893
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,260
in the world say in relationship

894
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,900
to that like I might say geelong's going

895
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,640
to win tomorrow and even when they're

896
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,859
lost I still think they've won

897
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,320
um and you can't you can't um

898
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,599
convince me of anything other than that

899
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,579
is that where my prior doesn't change

900
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
um

901
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,480
yeah so how does base in Surprise itself

902
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,579
well can you give us some examples of

903
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,400
how that might operate in in the world

904
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
in the real world

905
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,520
yeah it's an awesome question and to

906
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,079
connect really

907
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,300
surprised by itself so how surprising a

908
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
single observation is independent of how

909
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,220
it changes your belief

910
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,500
um you have a stereotype about some sort

911
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,180
of situation

912
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,700
something surprising happens but then

913
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,560
the Bayesian surprises zero because it's

914
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,300
a recalcitrant belief that the person

915
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,380
has

916
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,599
yeah in contrast there might be a

917
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,720
surprising event that induces a Bayesian

918
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,000
surprise because someone's like whoa I

919
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,980
thought about it this way and then I was

920
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,660
surprised by this observation and that

921
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,700
brought me over here

922
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,460
and then neither of those are the

923
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,140
experience of surprise

924
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,380
but that's an area of a lot of research

925
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,599
and discussion which is like how did

926
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,300
these Concepts in statistics like

927
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,020
beliefs surprises preferences

928
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,160
how do those map onto our psychology and

929
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,500
phenomenology is a preference in active

930
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,260
inference like I prefer A over B

931
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,780
is a expectation

932
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,359
related to what people use every day and

933
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,040
that's kind of the fun part with the

934
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,200
active inference ontology is some of

935
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,140
these terms are not used in day-to-day

936
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,480
conversation and so it's like a blank

937
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,420
campus but in other situations these are

938
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,980
terms that are used

939
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,920
day-to-day ambiguity yeah attention

940
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,960
belief

941
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,480
and so are we using them in a technical

942
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,140
sense that's compatible or isomorphic

943
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,420
with the way that it's used broadly

944
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,220
is incompatible

945
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,819
and so on

946
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,040
that's that's interesting I just had a

947
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,020
different perception of Bayesian

948
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,440
surprise then when you said surprise is

949
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,660
always surprise

950
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,460
but

951
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,160
Beijing surprise maps on to I think you

952
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,599
said something like the psychology or

953
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,240
the preferences or or whatever so so

954
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,460
it's not it's not really a surprise it's

955
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,220
it's how we

956
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,579
um manage surprise

957
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,380
could it be like that that's how what

958
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,660
sort of precisions we have on things so

959
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,300
that we so that we recognize something

960
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
or we don't recognize it

961
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,619
is it something like that excellent and

962
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,540
the connection to Precision is also

963
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,440
technically correct which is that when

964
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,020
observations are coming in and we're

965
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,060
treating them precisely

966
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,820
we do have Bayesian surprise because we

967
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,040
are updating our priors

968
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,400
when we have imprecision about

969
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,579
observations we do not update our

970
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,200
distributions of beliefs like oh that's

971
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,180
just a bad thermometer I know it says

972
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,060
that I believe it's 37 in the room

973
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,220
the thermometer is just weird it says 65

974
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,500
but don't worry about it

975
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,660
so then that's a surprising observation

976
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,700
under the belief that it's 37 plus or

977
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,079
minus one

978
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,820
but it doesn't induce a Bayesian

979
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,380
surprise because we haven't updated our

980
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,339
prior

981
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,880
prior yeah okay that's interesting

982
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
yep awesome so just to kind of so let's

983
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,740
yeah continue please

984
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,140
uh it's also interesting in that um I

985
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,420
watched that um

986
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,740
the the

987
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,740
um the podcasting with uh John for

988
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,240
record

989
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,380
um

990
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,020
the other day and it was interesting out

991
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,760
of there that just the language the use

992
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,020
of language and then you were just

993
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,520
talking about the ontology and different

994
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,220
uses and are we actually considering the

995
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,960
words that we're hearing

996
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,660
as as they actually are I think that's

997
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,060
really yeah it's really interesting

998
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,119
area with all of this because and it

999
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,619
makes it really

1000
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,900
what I've noticed in my in in what I

1001
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,060
listen to and and my studies is that

1002
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,560
it's like you have to keep going over

1003
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,180
and over and over until someone says

1004
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,379
something like you just said then

1005
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,640
okay

1006
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,599
incredible

1007
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,420
incredible

1008
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,140
thank you

1009
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,280
that's the relevance realization in a

1010
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,180
way with language

1011
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,160
just looks interesting oh

1012
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,660
sorry

1013
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,119
it is interesting

1014
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,700
um so we pay attention to it we update

1015
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,980
our priors we learn

1016
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,599
and we deal with the surprising

1017
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,339
observations and we deal with the

1018
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,280
Bayesian surprise to adjust our regime

1019
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,760
of attention and action

1020
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,619
along all these ways

1021
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:29,819
and

1022
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,819
we Meme and connect with the active

1023
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,440
phonetology

1024
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,680
rather than spiraling off into

1025
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,020
um uncertainties that aren't relevant

1026
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,180
but that's not to banish uncertainty

1027
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,220
like from the realm

1028
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,200
it's to have the right core screenings

1029
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,319
that help us deal with certain features

1030
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,060
of action and perception

1031
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,240
um

1032
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,760
here here's the subjective questions

1033
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,099
coming up Bayesian inference is optimal

1034
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:03,599
and this is also the root of like a

1035
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,859
million discussions how can it be

1036
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,680
optimal to to crash a car how could it

1037
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,079
be optimal to be wrong I mean we were

1038
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,400
talking about the how could I how could

1039
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,980
I be wrong if betting is always optimal

1040
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,079
how could I be wrong

1041
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,660
inference is subjective

1042
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,880
the results are not necessarily active

1043
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,740
accurate in any objective sense

1044
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,300
Bayesian cognition

1045
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,760
and optimal Bayesian calculation again

1046
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,500
doesn't mean Society accepts that

1047
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,000
neurodiversity

1048
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,099
it means that given that person's

1049
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,319
generative model and the observations

1050
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:38,760
coming in

1051
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,579
or their body as an embody generative

1052
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,500
model and the observations and

1053
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,480
constraints coming in

1054
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,260
that is its own local optimality and

1055
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,000
then there's secondary discussions

1056
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,599
around like is it adequate is it

1057
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,400
um best amongst a family of

1058
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
counterfactuals does society accept that

1059
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,220
and those are discussions to have but

1060
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,160
that's irrational

1061
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,200
will not be found here

1062
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,760
and that's a very interesting angle that

1063
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,119
kind of reframes a lot of again

1064
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,859
rationality versus irrational thinking

1065
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,700
um

1066
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,920
yeah and this is a second reason for

1067
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,119
optimality being thought of as

1068
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,280
subjective okay here we're going to get

1069
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,140
to figure two two

1070
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,540
which is a schematic that's going to be

1071
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,040
very

1072
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,619
um different remixes of this schematic

1073
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,720
will be found

1074
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,300
in many places

1075
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,099
um

1076
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:44,040
here is our model of temperature in the

1077
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,000
world

1078
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,220
here's the real temperature in the world

1079
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,020
hidden state

1080
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,880
here's our thermometer

1081
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,760
observations coming in

1082
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,859
we're updating and then we're taking

1083
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,040
actions which may

1084
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,200
over you know in some way influence the

1085
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,060
state of the temperature in the room

1086
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,000
so this is like the cybernetic Loop this

1087
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,040
is the control theoretic Loop

1088
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,440
this is describing

1089
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,359
um a kind of generalized again not

1090
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,880
active inference unique way

1091
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,920
in which

1092
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,660
um cognitive entities

1093
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,700
take in observations

1094
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,520
juxtapose them with a generative model

1095
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,800
and then do action selection to

1096
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,720
influence the hidden States

1097
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,579
such that the observations are brought

1098
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,200
into alignment with their preferences

1099
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,140
among other things

1100
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,400
um

1101
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,800
here's a short discussion that the state

1102
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,020
spaces don't have to be the same

1103
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,359
between x and x star

1104
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,700
so temperature in the real world might

1105
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,040
be like a continuous variable

1106
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,839
whereas we might just have a binary

1107
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,480
state is it too hot or not too hot

1108
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,920
or you might have a three state too cold

1109
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,200
just right too hot or five states

1110
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,839
getting too hot actually

1111
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,400
and then you might want to do model

1112
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,099
selection across two three four five

1113
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,500
states internally

1114
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,660
and none of that hinges on quote how it

1115
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,040
really is

1116
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,420
so

1117
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,800
um there's a lot of degrees of freedom

1118
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,380
in generating cognitive models

1119
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,140
and their structure doesn't need to map

1120
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,720
on to the neural anatomy of the brain it

1121
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,040
doesn't need to map onto a physical

1122
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,780
mechanism about the cognitive system

1123
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,819
which you may or may not even know and

1124
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,619
it doesn't have to be isomorphic the

1125
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,020
same structure as the hidden states of

1126
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,259
the world

1127
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,740
okay

1128
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,780
all of this so far has been purely

1129
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,660
inferential Brock

1130
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,420
I just wanted to I don't know leave a

1131
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,200
bookmark here uh stigmatically

1132
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:43,859
um

1133
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,480
that you mentioned something about

1134
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,660
neurodiversity there in the uh context

1135
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,819
of the Bayes optimality

1136
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,319
Rabbit Hole

1137
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,140
um and um just wanted to remind that

1138
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,460
like the origins of this come from

1139
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,880
uh Psychiatry and or the impetus for it

1140
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,319
of trying to have a

1141
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,260
causal reasoning tool for addressing

1142
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,819
certain kinds of

1143
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:16,400
mental illnesses so it's it really

1144
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,319
it doesn't yeah it just like you said it

1145
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,440
doesn't have to map to a specific you

1146
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,540
know architecture of brain Arrangement

1147
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,980
it's this in the world or whatever it's

1148
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,220
you know it is very much like

1149
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,859
based on the subjective model that's

1150
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,300
already in there

1151
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,040
and um

1152
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,900
it it could

1153
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,359
you could

1154
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,819
seeing the whole thing perhaps like

1155
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,420
reason about how it might make sense

1156
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,640
from their perspective

1157
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,079
for

1158
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,200
many different kinds of priors or

1159
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,359
whatever and um

1160
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,420
and why that would be optimal

1161
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,359
for that model like or seem like at this

1162
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,520
yeah so

1163
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,000
great comments and to kind of just

1164
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,460
Force age chapter nine

1165
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,920
this is the metabasian so it's

1166
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,040
the modeler's subjective model

1167
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,300
the psychiatrist's subjective model of

1168
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,060
their partner's subjective model

1169
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,800
so that is the um Genesis of so many

1170
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,200
discussions around the map and the

1171
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,480
territory and the fallacies and the

1172
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,540
fallacies upon fallacies and the the

1173
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,940
cause and effect and all these different

1174
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,380
discussions

1175
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,380
and this is how this modeling framework

1176
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,500
wraps that up it's a subjective model of

1177
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,060
a subjective model

1178
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,359
and that double subjectivity opens up an

1179
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,040
unbelievable amount of degrees of

1180
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,839
freedom in modeling

1181
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,119
which then refocuses the imperative

1182
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,319
towards selecting from these models

1183
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,560
but that's a little bit of a later point

1184
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,160
um

1185
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,500
just to in in the last minutes because

1186
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,480
again next week hopefully

1187
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,880
um many people will add

1188
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,119
simple tangential Advanced formal any

1189
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:13,920
kind of questions

1190
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,960
um but let's just in the last three or

1191
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,760
four minutes just see what else is going

1192
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,780
to happen

1193
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,680
all of this up to the point has been

1194
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,339
inferential Bayesian brain

1195
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:27,960
#livestream 43

1196
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,880
they're going to extend that inference

1197
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,040
about temperature

1198
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,420
so to speak

1199
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,099
in to include action

1200
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,200
how that happens

1201
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,700
is

1202
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,618
at the heart of active inference

1203
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,220
in the next sections they're going to

1204
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,720
clarify the quantity that active

1205
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,160
inference agents minimize through

1206
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,380
perception action as variational free

1207
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,260
energy one note minimization and

1208
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,540
maximization are like twins of each

1209
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,339
other because with just a negative sign

1210
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,940
they can be the same so when you see

1211
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,920
minimization or maximization you can

1212
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,780
just think of like finding

1213
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,339
relatively

1214
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,260
higher or lower values

1215
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,420
but like whether you choose to think of

1216
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,280
um like biologists talk about climbing

1217
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,460
mounts improbable like a Dawkins book

1218
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,900
and a physicist might talk about finding

1219
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,880
the bottom of an energy well

1220
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,460
but those are like going to be seen as

1221
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,839
kind of

1222
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:25,980
um

1223
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,680
not even like just sisters or twins of

1224
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,819
each other but like they're actually

1225
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,200
kind of the same thing through a

1226
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,000
negative sign

1227
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,619
there's two ways to reduce free energy

1228
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,380
as we will all come to learn and love

1229
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,839
you can update your model that's

1230
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:44,880
learning and perception

1231
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,740
and you can act in the world that's

1232
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,800
action action and inference active

1233
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,960
inference

1234
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,339
first you can learn

1235
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,460
this is a variant of figure 2-2

1236
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,260
where now we're being able to see how

1237
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,300
the prediction and the observation are

1238
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,559
being

1239
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,940
put together

1240
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,359
there's some discrepancy

1241
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,760
in any realistic situation there will

1242
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,160
eventually be a discrepancy

1243
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,740
and then here are those two roads to

1244
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,800
reduce free energy change beliefs

1245
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,599
which can be perception perception and

1246
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,119
learning are much more similar in active

1247
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:25,980
inference than other Frameworks

1248
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,480
like when the ball moves across your

1249
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,599
visual field are you perceiving it or

1250
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,280
are you learning the position of it as

1251
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,319
it moves over rapid time skills so

1252
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,540
they're kind of the same

1253
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,558
and can you act

1254
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,220
here's how you can resolve that

1255
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,559
discrepancy you can change your mind

1256
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,720
about what you're seeing that's

1257
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,800
perception

1258
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,059
or you could act

1259
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,839
that doesn't mean both of them are

1260
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,160
equally good or they're going to result

1261
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,960
in your survival or they're plausible in

1262
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,880
any given situation so it's always

1263
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,980
situational what affordances

1264
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,599
there are for Learning and perception

1265
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:03,119
and for action but this is the general

1266
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,660
framework

1267
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,920
how does free energy get Quantified and

1268
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,260
minimized

1269
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,200
we'll return to this later but equation

1270
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,900
2 5 and 2 6 are going to be really key

1271
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,280
equations

1272
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,160
thankfully through the work of of many

1273
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,260
people here

1274
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,359
we have really excellent natural

1275
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,640
language descriptions connected to the

1276
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,859
ontology

1277
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:33,900
we also have a lot of like notes and

1278
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,000
questions people have added

1279
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,059
and things like derivations

1280
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,559
for those who want to go that way that

1281
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,260
Jacob and others have worked on

1282
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,819
so

1283
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:49,020
these lines of symbols

1284
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,900
can be read this way and with a mouse

1285
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,140
over

1286
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,960
we can see what those are so yes it's

1287
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,240
like words words words

1288
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,839
but um we we have a staged development

1289
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,240
around these equations because we're

1290
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,099
going to be revisiting them and

1291
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:11,579
understanding how this F

1292
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:12,960
as the free energy that's being

1293
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,480
minimized I mean free energy principle

1294
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,119
this is kind of what it's about

1295
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,760
how can it be

1296
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,920
decomposed

1297
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,680
into these different

1298
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,440
sets of natural language terms and in

1299
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,819
what sense are these terms being used

1300
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:31,800
again we don't have the minutes to

1301
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,920
describe but variational free energy f

1302
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,520
is about the past of the presence

1303
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,160
that's figures I mean equation two five

1304
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,359
equation

1305
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:43,500
um and this is what it looks like a

1306
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,020
little bit graphically

1307
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,540
here's variational free energy

1308
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,000
the same figure that was two before but

1309
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,440
now there's an equation here

1310
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,960
when we want to look into the future

1311
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,740
there are going to be several

1312
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,619
complexities arising which is that we're

1313
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:03,119
talking about the surprise of

1314
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,760
observations we haven't observed yet and

1315
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,859
we're talking about the consequences of

1316
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:10,140
actions that we aren't sure about what

1317
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,240
their consequences will be and so

1318
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,720
variational free energy F equation 2.5

1319
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,460
morphs into expected free energy G

1320
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,440
equation 2.6

1321
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,140
similarly

1322
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,079
excellent work in progress as everything

1323
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,140
is to unpack what this is in natural

1324
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,500
language

1325
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,200
there are some special cases for

1326
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,960
expected free energy

1327
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,940
such that when certain terms are ignored

1328
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,760
or set to zero we get a lot of special

1329
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,440
cases

1330
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,119
that are in quite broad use

1331
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,160
and then that's the end of the low road

1332
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,859
equation 2 5 variational free energy

1333
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:59,040
past and present equation 2 6 expected

1334
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,660
free energy G

1335
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,880
future

1336
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,000
that's the end of the low road chapter

1337
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,619
so

1338
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:10,260
that has been this first discussion on

1339
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,180
chapter two

1340
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,300
hope that people have enjoyed and it

1341
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,280
would be extremely appreciated to write

1342
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,040
any questions that you have on chapter

1343
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,180
two

1344
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,280
so that we can as as people were adding

1345
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,020
during this conversation so that we can

1346
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,780
have some specifics to follow up on so

1347
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,119
good luck with your learning in the next

1348
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,740
week and see you all soon
