1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,640
hello it's February 15 2023

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,740
were in

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,219
cohort 2 of the octave textbook

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,280
we are in our first discussion on

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,320
chapter seven

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,279
so let's just first look at how chapter

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,699
7 is anticipated in the text

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,779
then any of you are welcome to give some

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,820
thoughts or just raise any thoughts or

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,460
questions on chapter seven

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,680
and then that will go wherever it goes

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,719
we can also look at previously submitted

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,300
questions as well as walk through the

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,340
text and get a big picture of what's

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,320
happening so the first mention of

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,020
chapter 7 is in chapter one when they're

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,760
summarizing chapter seven

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,340
and they describe that in chapter seven

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,140
they're going to discuss active

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,000
inference models addressing problems

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
formulated in discrete times

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,399
as hidden Markov models and partially

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,879
observable Markov decision processes

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,400
and they mention the examples they're

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,560
going to use which is a left or right at

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,180
A T maze

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,920
and they also bring in topics

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,900
information seeking learning novelty

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,240
seeking

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,080
they talk about how preference

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,840
represented by the C parameter is going

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,180
to be unpacked in chapter seven

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,220
in chapter four

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,420
they talk about how message passing

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,400
will be unpacked further in chapter

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
seven

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
in chapter five

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
they talk about e and policy so as

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,479
they're mentioning a bunch of the

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
parameters e Pi C

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,640
message passing they're describing that

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,840
they're going to come back to it in

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,320
chapter seven

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,060
um if we want to change the way the

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,040
signal is interpreted we need to rely on

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,420
learning we will return to this in

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,119
detail in chapter seven

48
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,979
in chapter 7 we will discuss a

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,659
biologically plausible example of

50
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,700
factorization

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,619
specifically the what and the where

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,399
streams

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,819
and in chapter 6 in the recipe

54
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,580
they talk about the updating in the form

55
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,300
of the updating

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,280
so several more mentions of chapter

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
seven in chapter six

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,660
and then we actually get to chapter

59
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,400
seven itself

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,959
all right so

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,200
anyone just to begin with

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,319
what were your thoughts or feelings on

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,140
reading chapter seven or what

64
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,459
came to mind as you read or

65
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,739
remembered reading

66
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,019
chapter 7 active inference in discrete

67
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,140
time

68
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,120
just on me and go for it

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,980
yeah well I I didn't read it completely

70
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,280
but there's a number of questions that

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,819
popped up in for instance in figure

72
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,238
seven three

73
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,459
um

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
so the a matrix is conditioned not only

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,840
on one state but a couple of states

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,900
is that correct I know I mean

77
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,099
it's uh so the the sequence of

78
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,359
preceding States

79
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,799
uh takes uh well is there place a role

80
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,840
that's different to Hidden Markov model

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
right

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,180
and then

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,920
so this would be one question how this

84
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,440
could be and then my another question is

85
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,260
whether this pie

86
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,620
actually makes this whole automaton more

87
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,720
powerful or

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,459
is this just a convenient way of uh of

89
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,019
representing it

90
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,739
so

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
um so could this pie actually be merged

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,720
in into the state as an additional

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,699
factor or something so multiply the

94
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,880
number of states and or does it really

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,139
increase the computational power of that

96
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,940
whole automaton

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,780
great questions

98
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,960
all right so yeah yeah Jacob go for it

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,258
first

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,840
um

101
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,900
I think that the

102
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,080
in terms of putting the pie into the

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,419
states themselves

104
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,800
um

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I I don't I don't think I've seen that

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,199
ever being

107
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,280
um done in an actual model and I think

108
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,100
this is more of

109
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,160
a representation rather than really how

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,100
the model would be implemented because

111
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,979
the pie is just

112
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,120
is just the policy and it's I think it's

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,780
uh it like branches out to the two the

114
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,840
two B's uh from like a single node only

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,199
to represent that each B is also

116
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,699
conditioned on the policy

117
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,759
uh but not necessarily that

118
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,020
um

119
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,660
it's like a one

120
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,240
that that it happens within like one

121
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,600
time snapshot

122
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,280
yes

123
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,060
yeah in in some other work Jacob and I

124
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,120
have talked a lot about like why is pi

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
shown to intervene twice and even more

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
generally why is it shown with three

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,680
time steps yes it helps us understand

128
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,740
that it's like past present and future

129
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,100
but the action perception Loop also

130
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,840
could be shown

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,479
with just the transition between two

132
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,620
steps

133
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,840
and Pi intervening once

134
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,759
whereas this is a little bit ambiguous

135
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,259
whether it's a policy of length two

136
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,300
intervening at this time point

137
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,100
or whether it's just showing the

138
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,199
continual unfolding

139
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,800
of policy

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
interleaving between the hidden States

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,638
in a sort of open-ended way

142
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,520
um

143
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
but

144
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,039
what what do you mean Michael by

145
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,780
increasing the computational power

146
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,060
um I mean it it would be possible to

147
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,400
have the

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,100
uh dynamics of the Hidden States through

149
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,180
b

150
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,180
complex

151
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,180
but by removing pi and the action

152
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,280
selection apparatus

153
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,940
then if we only had the rake

154
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,099
down below

155
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,940
it would just be a passive inference

156
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,099
uh algorithm with a potentially complex

157
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,940
endogenous dynamic

158
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,440
well I I had the can I give an example

159
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,479
yeah oh yeah

160
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,840
so I I was thinking of so there is that

161
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,360
some kind of recursion possible for

162
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
instance I was thinking of the following

163
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,620
example assume that I want to

164
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,300
go and buy a bread

165
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,599
and then I go out and then on my way to

166
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,080
the bakery I see a haircut and I think

167
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,599
oh before buying this bed I could go to

168
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
the Hakata and then crossing the street

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,340
I see um

170
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,780
um uh

171
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,840
a shop with journals and then I think oh

172
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,360
when I sit there with a haircut I should

173
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
maybe buy a journal to read something

174
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,160
then I go to that journal I see a friend

175
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,259
and the friend tells me oh I have a new

176
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,379
car you want to come to see my car and

177
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,919
so I passed the half of the day going

178
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,099
forward and then eventually I backtrack

179
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:34,740
coming back from the car going by going

180
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,719
to the haircutter buying the bread and

181
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
in the evening I go home so this is a

182
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
kind of a recursive thing right so so

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,820
there is an action and then it there's

184
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,519
an intervention with another action but

185
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,580
then there is uh so it's a kind of a

186
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,040
recursive thing and each of those

187
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,100
actions maybe follows a policy but that

188
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,360
can be

189
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,880
there there can be another policy that

190
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,399
inter intervenes but then I backtrack

191
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,580
from there so that would actually be um

192
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,640
yes a recursive

193
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,459
a kind of a policy is is something like

194
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,700
this possible so this would really I

195
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,480
guess

196
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,779
um increase the computational power

197
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,560
um

198
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,839
with respect to just

199
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,500
completing one policy or one sequence of

200
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,200
actions and then going to the next where

201
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
you know where one iterates the stuff

202
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,700
instead off

203
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,339
the possibility to do that recursively

204
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,440
so there's something like this I was

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
thinking so is it possible to have some

206
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,899
recursive

207
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,320
policies there

208
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,080
one question I mean with no is to to

209
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,680
live stream 42 which was on Robotics and

210
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,500
the slam simultaneous localization and

211
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,580
mapping

212
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,880
there's a higher level policy selection

213
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,160
around what location the robot wants to

214
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,240
go and then a lower level tactical level

215
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,720
that is about the actual motor actuation

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,600
so in that example that you gave

217
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,459
there might be like a higher level model

218
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,820
of which location you want to go towards

219
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,920
and then there's a lower level footstep

220
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
model

221
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,600
and then this decision this shifting of

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,040
decision

223
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,420
could be modeled as policies on which

224
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,940
location one is seeking

225
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,580
so as with many features it's not

226
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,620
necessarily intrinsic to this figure 7.3

227
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,800
as the kernel but you can compose it in

228
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,600
order to capture some of those Dynamics

229
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
Ali and then Jacob

230
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,000
it

231
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,420
uh yeah well actually I think uh uh

232
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,300
described in those terms I mean uh

233
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,040
recursively updating uh the generative

234
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,959
model uh is just uh for the it can just

235
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,860
be for the purpose of building a

236
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,040
comprehensive uh generative model I mean

237
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,339
as comprehensively as we can but when we

238
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,640
include the policies

239
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,880
as the additional parameter in our

240
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,240
generative model uh actually this is a

241
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,980
kind of

242
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,600
um a technique used for bring the

243
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,880
elements of action selection uh two or

244
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,820
um within the the Bayesian belief

245
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
updating which is called the planning as

246
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,160
inference so in order to do that

247
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,459
uh policy selection or

248
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,360
I mean constructing a space of all

249
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,660
possible actions uh is a necessity a

250
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,839
requirement to do to do these uh kinds

251
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,760
of planning as inference but yeah it's

252
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,600
just a kind of uh mathematical uh trick

253
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,240
if you will uh to somehow bring together

254
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,880
uh the action selection into the

255
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,660
mechanism of uh Bayesian belief updating

256
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,380
but but this this possibility oh sorry

257
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,100
continue

258
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,640
yeah so so this possibility is not in

259
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,920
picture seven three right so because

260
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,279
these arrows go from PI

261
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,060
to the B Matrix but there's not a kind

262
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,899
of an error going back so

263
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,100
so if I are you saying the trick would

264
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,079
be that

265
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,000
one learns

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,480
a pie inside a pie

267
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,980
somehow

268
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,399
yeah you see this is just one policy a

269
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
picture a snapshot of a one policy uh

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,399
but uh in the more comprehensive models

271
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,399
we have uh the state of possible and I

272
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,399
mean uh we have policies and not just

273
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,480
one single policy to select from so yeah

274
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,560
that's just that picture just shows how

275
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,639
uh the uh I mean choosing a single

276
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,600
policy can affect uh the uh generative

277
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,579
model and how it can do the inference

278
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,260
via planning or action selection but in

279
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,620
reality or I mean uh when dealing with

280
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,339
more comprehensive uh models

281
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,120
we have uh not we don't necessarily have

282
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,720
just one single policy to do uh to uh

283
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
select from I mean uh it would be

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,700
tautological to have just one single

285
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,660
policy so we need a space of uh

286
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,519
possibility yes

287
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,459
if there was just one policy

288
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,160
and there is no agency around selecting

289
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,240
it

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,660
then it reverts to a passive inference

291
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,220
challenge

292
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,320
whereas the structure of the B Matrix

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,779
which you can explore from a Hands-On

294
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,579
perspective like by looking at the

295
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,839
dimensionality of it in piodp

296
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,300
the inference problem is set up such

297
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,480
that agents are deciding between pi 1

298
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,240
and Pi 2 which are evaluated according

299
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,760
to their expected free energy and Pi 1

300
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,940
and Pi 2 do different things

301
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,380
to be

302
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,839
so we can think of like a B1 and B2 not

303
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,720
time point one and two but variant or

304
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,339
slice one and two

305
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,720
that

306
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,880
change how hidden States change their

307
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,680
time so Jacob

308
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,300
um

309
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,180
I guess on the question of

310
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,279
um like recursion and

311
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,199
uh with your example of like going to

312
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:19,740
um

313
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,620
to a barber and then seeing oh

314
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,380
um I want to buy a magazine to read and

315
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,720
like going the policy changing

316
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,680
throughout

317
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,000
I guess

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,459
I'm not

319
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:35,579
uh I'm not really sure I see the

320
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,339
recursion there in in like an active

321
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,839
inference model because I think it's

322
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,680
more

323
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,360
I'd say it's more like a very high

324
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,300
dimensional model where you are perhaps

325
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,560
performing

326
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,560
uh where you're always like narrowing

327
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,459
down your policy search space

328
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,240
um

329
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,000
and with new observations you're like

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,820
adjusting that search base based on your

331
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,220
preferences in that particular

332
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,639
uh observational modality like you get

333
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,440
reminded that there are magazines and

334
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
that you can buy magazines to read

335
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
uh while you're at another place so it

336
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,459
kind of extends that computation but I

337
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,579
don't think it's necessarily

338
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,980
um recursive and also

339
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,480
I think the

340
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,060
the figure

341
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,260
um I think you mentioned something about

342
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,300
like uh

343
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,540
prediction errors or uh so something

344
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,860
like that I don't think that's

345
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,779
necessarily captivated in the figure

346
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,199
because that only shows well I I guess

347
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,940
it's not explicit but it we can assume

348
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,180
that the B There is static and you can

349
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,399
imagine

350
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,800
a lot of other things happening if you

351
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,660
would be learning the B major fix or

352
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,579
doing uh model selection as well

353
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,880
um and adjusting your policy based on

354
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,660
what observational modality has the

355
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,220
um

356
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,820
highest

357
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,959
um precision

358
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,619
and can I answer uh yeah to this so so I

359
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,520
think

360
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,179
well maybe you can represent this in a

361
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,119
in a way of an iteration or the way you

362
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,240
say but it it would be recursive in my

363
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,319
understanding of the these terms if if

364
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,799
if going for instance to the baker is is

365
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,400
a policy means it's a series of actions

366
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,520
right and so if this is a policy and

367
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,400
then in the middle of this there is

368
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
somehow another policy that pops up oh I

369
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,740
go first to the hair cutter or to the

370
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,020
barber whatever and then

371
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,440
this uh one policy still exists but

372
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,080
inside there's another kind of sequence

373
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,299
of actions another plan and so on

374
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,360
popping up and this if this could happen

375
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,539
recursive I mean in my understanding of

376
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,039
this term of um of these terms uh it it

377
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,960
would be kind of recursive

378
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,840
no

379
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,820
yeah yeah it can be through nested

380
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,260
modeling which is one canonical way that

381
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,260
recursion is implemented so it's it's

382
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,500
unfolding sequentially Through Time

383
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,059
but also like this higher level

384
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,740
um discrete time so that's again we're

385
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,380
chapter seven we're in discrete time

386
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,340
and so this might be a slower click

387
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,179
so maybe the footsteps are taking place

388
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,580
on a second to Second policy tick

389
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,440
timeline

390
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,440
whereas a policy in which location one

391
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,140
wants to go is being evaluated at a

392
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,059
slower level

393
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,960
and if the if this nested level

394
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,140
is playing out at at um a similar

395
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,580
frequency

396
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,320
to the lower level

397
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,660
than

398
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,940
um as a modeler you might be better off

399
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,640
just having it as a single level model

400
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,740
and as an organism you'd get into these

401
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,380
kind of like paralysis

402
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,419
cases where if you're actually switching

403
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,000
policies about where you want to go

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,299
then this would be incoherent down a

405
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,720
lower level

406
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,000
um

407
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,480
so just return to the initial question

408
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,940
is it possible to merge policy into the

409
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,460
hidden States as as a causal latent

410
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,880
factor well in a way policy intervenes

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,559
in how hidden States through change

412
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,700
their time so policy does influence

413
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,039
hidden States

414
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,240
without an action selection apparatus

415
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,419
it's not active inference it's not even

416
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,120
a control theory problem it's just a

417
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,200
question of identifying latent causes

418
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,179
from the unfolding of a hidden States

419
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,580
and observables that you can't control

420
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,419
and that's a classical SPM type

421
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,080
challenge like s might be the latent

422
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,100
unobserved neural activity and O might

423
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,000
be multi-sensor fusion with fmri EEG and

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,260
Meg

425
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,080
so this can still be very complex in its

426
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,400
unfolding through time with the

427
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,679
observations in the hidden States

428
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,660
what would make it an active inference

429
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,220
problem well if you weren't just

430
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,100
observing sensor modalities

431
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,620
but if the experimenter could take a

432
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,000
policy

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,320
that was intervening how neural Dynamics

434
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,660
change through time which is what

435
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,020
experimental design is which is why it's

436
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,620
so compatible with thinking about

437
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,940
um

438
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,980
the metabasian approach with the

439
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,940
behavioral researcher

440
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,600
so apply influences hidden States

441
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,419
but if we merely folded

442
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,419
into B we would lose the ability to do

443
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,100
actual action selection

444
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,960
but if it were a passive inference

445
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,580
problem

446
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,179
we still could use variational inference

447
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,659
we still could use a free energy

448
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,640
we still could even align outcomes with

449
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,620
our preferences we could still calculate

450
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,900
and bound surprise

451
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,220
the active embedding of active inference

452
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,220
is to include action as a parameter like

453
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,980
Ali mentioned within the Bayesian brain

454
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,720
context

455
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,600
to have a parameter that you do Bayesian

456
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,179
inference on

457
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,280
and then extend that not just from

458
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,679
perception and causal inference which is

459
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,600
what's happening on the bottom

460
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,840
like perception is the a

461
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
causal inference can be understood as B

462
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,419
but action selection does require an

463
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,380
additional apparatus

464
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,539
passive inference more like signal

465
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,220
processing

466
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,220
action more like control theory

467
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,559
unified imperative

468
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,440
so the G would then be predicting the

469
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,600
future of expectations developing of

470
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,059
expectations and so on

471
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,580
what would it be

472
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,179
what is g the G the pi

473
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,340
oh sorry oh

474
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,440
well pi

475
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,919
is the combinatorics of affordances over

476
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,900
a given time Horizon

477
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,460
so merely generating pi as a list

478
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,100
is not intrinsically difficult it's just

479
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,740
the search space of possible action

480
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,140
sequences over a given time Horizon

481
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,720
if there's two options and you're doing

482
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,400
a Time Horizon of three then it's two

483
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,840
cubed

484
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,620
um G is the expected free energy

485
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,400
which updates the policy prior

486
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,620
so take that list and it's your prior

487
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,559
probability of those policies

488
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,080
which could be either just a uniform

489
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,100
prior

490
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,480
or

491
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,340
could reflect habit

492
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,000
like a priori How likely are policies

493
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,620
and then G

494
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,960
sharpens or updates

495
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,720
that policy vector

496
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,440
into a policy posterior which then the

497
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,179
agent samples their actions from

498
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,039
and and how um how is this meant so I

499
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,140
assume that I'm so you're saying the

500
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,520
first is the past and then um so is this

501
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,960
um

502
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,700
is this re re-estimated at every state

503
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,600
so so the Spy would somehow

504
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,100
have um expectations of a future

505
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,600
affordances as you say right

506
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,659
but would say which which transitions

507
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,400
are more likely in the

508
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,240
uh to the right of this graph

509
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,840
and would that be re-estimated in at

510
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,000
each time

511
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,740
um

512
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,940
time step or okay how would that yeah

513
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,760
there's there's multiple possible levels

514
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,200
only go first then I'll give a thought

515
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,799
well basically Pi actually is just an

516
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,000
additional parameter uh multiplied to

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,200
the basic uh Bayes theorem formula we

518
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,020
had before so instead of just

519
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,320
multiplying likelihood and uh the priors

520
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,980
simply we also multiply the probability

521
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,720
of selecting a policy and that's just it

522
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,320
so Pi is just an additional parameter in

523
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,140
that equation from chapter back in

524
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,299
chapter two

525
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,620
yeah

526
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,080
equation 2.6

527
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,659
is where G is defined

528
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:27,000
so G is a a function of policies

529
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,140
so it takes in as arguments the vector

530
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,760
of policies

531
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,539
and then conditioning as we see in every

532
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,080
single of these phrasings

533
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,900
every single one is conditioned upon a

534
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,539
given policy

535
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,900
and then different policies

536
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,539
are compared

537
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,880
by their expected free energy

538
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,179
and then depending on the Precision on

539
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,860
the action posterior

540
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,640
which isn't shown in 7.3 you can have a

541
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,799
spectrum of behavior if you have

542
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,900
extremely high precision

543
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,179
like a um it could be thought of as low

544
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,860
temperature

545
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,720
in that case

546
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,960
one policy that's let's just say one is

547
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,340
um it's one percent better than the

548
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,159
other then under the low temperature

549
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,000
asymptote the high Precision asymptote

550
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,400
the policy that's even tiny tiny bit

551
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,460
better will always be selected

552
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,000
under the neutral temperature

553
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,500
Zone

554
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,020
policies are selected based upon their

555
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,200
posterior likelihood so if one of them

556
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,260
is 51 percent and the other is 49 when

557
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,020
you soft Max it then it's selected

558
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,960
51 and 49 of the time respectively and

559
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
then in the high temperature or low

560
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,460
Precision asymptote

561
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,039
also known as shaky hand

562
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,740
the differences amongst policies in

563
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,600
their expected free energy basically get

564
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,919
erased

565
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,779
and at that point

566
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,760
policies are selected

567
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,419
essentially without respect to their

568
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,679
posterior likelihood

569
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,779
this is one of the key pieces though

570
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,360
because again we're not calculating

571
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,059
different policies and asking well how

572
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,640
rewarding are they how much expected

573
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,100
reward do they have and then ranking or

574
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,779
selecting based on that

575
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,220
rather

576
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,500
there's a unified imperative expected

577
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,820
free energy

578
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,340
which under different decompositions can

579
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,900
be shown to have these different

580
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,720
interpretations

581
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,659
that is then used to generate a policy

582
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,419
posterior and then as just described

583
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,539
that policy posterior in the context of

584
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,140
a of a temperature or Precision variable

585
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,880
can exhibit behaviors ranging from

586
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,400
always selecting the slightly preferred

587
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,620
policy in the low temperature limit

588
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,200
neutral temperature selecting according

589
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,260
to the posterior high temperature

590
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,240
erasing differences in the posterior Ali

591
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,720
yeah uh sorry I just wanted to point out

592
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,679
that uh this G Matrix here is uh still

593
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,320
prior to learning so uh if we want to

594
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,700
add learning to uh to into the policies

595
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,419
uh things would get a little bit more uh

596
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,059
not to say complicated but more extended

597
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,960
equations would be needed so uh we

598
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,900
haven't included learning in this

599
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,320
specific formulation yet it's prior to

600
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,400
learning

601
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,360
yes thanks yeah I I um I also want to

602
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,580
highlight that like

603
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,400
in in the category of phenomena that we

604
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,580
can model but are not just simply in

605
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,620
this image

606
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,039
you mentioned like learning new policies

607
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,980
so it's like in the fixed fixed fixed

608
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,419
case

609
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,059
you're still able to do action selection

610
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,460
but you're not learning or changing

611
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,400
which policies you can enact you're not

612
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,020
changing what affordances you believe

613
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,860
you have nor are you updating B which is

614
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,380
to say you're not updating your beliefs

615
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,899
about how policies influence hidden

616
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,460
State changes

617
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,320
the next level of introduction of

618
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,960
novelty is learning on B

619
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,600
where you can learn about the different

620
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,899
consequences of policy and then another

621
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,600
level which is starting to approach into

622
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,460
like the structural learning because

623
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,140
you're actually changing not just

624
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,740
parameters within the model but

625
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,120
dimensionality of parameters within the

626
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,600
model is like well what if I take a

627
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,419
policy that opens up another set of

628
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,820
possible policies

629
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,020
so this is like see the cat run

630
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,120
of sentences

631
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,179
and to introduce recursive or

632
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,520
referential Clauses or learning it's a

633
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
more complex sentence so to speak

634
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,200
but this is the archetype that sets the

635
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
stage for what cognitive model

636
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,200
structures could exhibit that kind of a

637
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,100
phenomena Michael

638
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,140
yeah so

639
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,080
um a policy

640
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,159
would be a number of actions right would

641
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,760
be a sequence of States yeah is is that

642
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,640
am I understanding correct and if this

643
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,080
is the case then a policy would select a

644
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,299
number of states

645
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,659
and my question I guess is

646
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,500
um so then I come at the end or at what

647
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,840
point are these policies then uh

648
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,659
calculated so I come to the end of my uh

649
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,860
of a of an action and then only is the

650
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,940
uh it's the it's a new um policy uh a

651
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,640
computer or selected or is it constantly

652
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,299
the case

653
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,820
so if um if I decide to to go to buy a

654
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,340
bread for instance and then I go out and

655
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,080
I cross the street and do this and that

656
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,600
so there's a couple of actions involved

657
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,899
right and so my decision to buy a bread

658
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,980
was done before but on the way

659
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,159
um is that policy recalculated and maybe

660
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,659
on on the way I think oh I um

661
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,200
uh something else is is more reasonable

662
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,820
to do

663
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,919
um

664
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,380
okay so again that's it's a slightly

665
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,899
nested scenario with with multiple

666
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,480
levels of policy that you're

667
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,640
um looking at and then just to be clear

668
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,399
so policy it's a sequence of actions so

669
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,720
let's just say that the affordances

670
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,080
there's two affordances up or down

671
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,600
and then time Horizon is three

672
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,059
well let's just say it's two

673
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,559
there are four policies you you d d u d

674
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,700
d

675
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,020
so generating the state space of

676
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,159
policies

677
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,779
is trivial

678
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,779
it's just all of the strings of

679
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,700
affordances

680
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,480
now you ask where does policy inference

681
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,640
happen where and how does it happen and

682
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,740
there's a few different answers so first

683
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,899
off here's from our active inference and

684
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,419
modeling conflict paper here we chose to

685
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,360
show only a two-step model

686
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,059
so instead of the the three because we

687
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:54,539
were anticipating that

688
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,120
um ambiguity

689
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,700
where Pi is intervening twice when

690
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,399
actually control is only exerted at any

691
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,440
given moment but it's it's

692
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,299
anticipated

693
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,779
um and then we map this onto the UDA

694
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,899
observe Orient decide act this isn't a

695
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,320
formal mapping per se but it it helps

696
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,559
understand sequentially for example in a

697
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,039
reactive message passing paradigm

698
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,779
what different informally

699
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,760
categorized states of the perception

700
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,700
cognition Action Cycle how that maps

701
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,159
onto this basing graph so since States

702
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,659
come in

703
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,320
cognition on occurs

704
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
or one could also take a broader

705
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,539
perspective then but this updates one's

706
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,940
beliefs about the world

707
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,539
then there's an inference on action

708
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,360
so here are the antecedents of policy

709
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,279
selection which are

710
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,760
e what can be done the affordances

711
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,460
see what is preferred the preferences

712
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,740
preferred slash expected

713
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,860
and then with c and e

714
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
as it shows here

715
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,418
G is a function

716
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:21,480
of policies conditioned upon c and e

717
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,540
so with those antecedents taken care of

718
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,440
we can update our beliefs on pi

719
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,879
to move from a policy prior

720
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,879
to a policy posterior

721
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,760
those policy posteriors can then be

722
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,040
sampled from as discussed earlier at

723
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,080
high low or neutral temperature

724
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,839
and then the selected policy

725
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,879
intervenes and ends up choosing a slice

726
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,500
in b

727
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,699
and then the slice of B that's chosen

728
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,640
influences how the hidden States change

729
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,619
for example if there's two Paul if

730
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,260
there's two policies on a one-time step

731
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,540
basis so same as the affordances in this

732
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,900
case turn on the heater or do not turn

733
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,040
on the heater

734
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,740
so maybe if we don't turn on the heater

735
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,800
then the B Matrix just passes the hidden

736
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,660
State forward the temperature doesn't

737
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,800
change

738
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,020
if we do turn on the heater the

739
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,940
temperature increases immediately again

740
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,099
simple example

741
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,480
so

742
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,839
we looked at the thermometer oh

743
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,119
updated our belief given our priors

744
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,400
about the temperature of the room

745
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,880
then with respect to what we can do e

746
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,839
and what we expect slash prefers C

747
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,200
we updated our policy prior into a

748
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,119
policy posterior

749
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,060
we then selected the action

750
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,980
that's most likely

751
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,200
not the most rewarding action

752
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,480
the most likely action

753
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,540
and that influenced how the hidden

754
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,579
States changed their time

755
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,560
and then the UDA cycle begins again

756
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,020
so action intervenes

757
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,660
in the discrete time formalization which

758
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,780
is where we're in chapter seven

759
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:21,560
it intervenes in every time click

760
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
okay thank you so much

761
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,820
and and also um the pragmatic turn

762
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,540
is um it's a book co-edited by friston

763
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,540
but it discusses like

764
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,740
what

765
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,220
has happened in Neuroscience with people

766
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,740
embedding action and thinking about

767
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,980
action in neuroscience

768
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,440
and that's relatively recent which is

769
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,099
really exciting

770
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,420
okay but these are these are great

771
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,700
questions and then let's just also go to

772
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,020
the um

773
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,900
second question that you raised there

774
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,780
and then we'll scan through all of

775
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,980
chapter seven

776
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,940
so is the a matrix in figure 7.3

777
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,640
conditioned on one state or a series of

778
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,579
States so

779
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,560
yes

780
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,960
Jacob feel free to add any more details

781
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,140
on this one but as it's shown here from

782
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,000
a base graph perspective

783
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,440
it is O of T minus 1 is only conditioned

784
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,900
on S of T minus 1.

785
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,740
but when we think about across the

786
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,339
vector of observations

787
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,200
they can be understood as being

788
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,359
conditioned upon

789
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,098
the time series of hidden States

790
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,099
so each observation is only conditioned

791
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,859
upon its Associated hidden State that's

792
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,260
the partially observable and hidden

793
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,579
States

794
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,099
pass through the Markov needle of the

795
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,980
presence that's the markovian property

796
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,839
past only influences the future through

797
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,440
the present

798
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,099
which isn't to say that's how reality is

799
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,780
that just to say it's a simplifying

800
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,180
structural assumption

801
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,118
that one could vary if they chose

802
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,640
but it is a little ambiguous I I I can

803
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,560
see why somebody might think that

804
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,020
observation at a given t

805
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,020
let's say t plus one is can is a

806
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,960
function that's conditioned upon all the

807
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,359
previous types

808
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,920
but not directly

809
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,260
observations are like cul-de-sacs

810
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,020
and again a is The Tail of Two densities

811
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,079
the recognition density which is from

812
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,960
observations updating beliefs about

813
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
hidden States

814
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,579
Bayesian recognition model

815
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,300
and the generative density which is from

816
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,000
a hidden state

817
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,940
generating pseudo-observations

818
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,540
and the way that those two densities

819
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,400
can be alternated

820
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,640
is used and has been used for decades in

821
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,220
expectation maximization algorithms

822
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,839
okay

823
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,240
cool great

824
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,760
questions here

825
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,200
um

826
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,140
does anyone want to go to any

827
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,020
of the chapter 7 questions or should we

828
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,060
scan through in the last 15 minutes here

829
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,279
just like what happens in chapter seven

830
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,359
foreign

831
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,099
Let's scan

832
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,740
raise your hands when you want and I'll

833
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,480
immediately go to you

834
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,280
if you want to

835
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,020
um just add a note on like as we scan

836
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,880
through so we will scan through the

837
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,839
whole thing in the next 10 minutes okay

838
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,400
starting with a quote what I cannot

839
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,339
create I do not understand famous

840
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,140
quote

841
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,359
take it or leave it

842
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,400
but now we're into the building the

843
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,140
recipe has been disclosed in chapter six

844
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,180
the prerequisite knowledge has been

845
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,060
distributed in chapters one through five

846
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,720
ideally

847
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,540
they start with perceptual processing

848
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,359
this is very much like the step-by-step

849
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,339
paper

850
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,160
step by step starts even simpler with

851
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,339
starting with just a static inference

852
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,599
but here they go immediately to Dynamic

853
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,820
perceptual inference this is just the

854
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,220
bottom of the rake this is a passive

855
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,780
inference

856
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,700
but it is changing through time

857
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,980
they're going to be using a music

858
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,980
example

859
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,020
speaking to their target audience which

860
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,579
is Ali

861
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,820
um a musical example

862
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,420
so we're listening to some music

863
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,940
not necessarily playing

864
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,440
um the music

865
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,920
but the outcome is the note that's

866
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,740
actually intended I'm sorry the outcome

867
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,420
is what is actually played and the

868
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,480
hidden state is the intended note

869
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,480
and just from looking at this a matrix

870
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,839
we can see that like on the diagonals if

871
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,000
it was the identity Matrix

872
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,560
that would mean that there was a perfect

873
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,660
mapping between hidden State and

874
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,359
observations but this is not an identity

875
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,960
Matrix it has off diagonal values which

876
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,540
is to say it's like a blurry a matrix

877
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,359
and in the limit of a blurry a an

878
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,680
ambiguous a

879
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,780
you could imagine if it was all 2.5S

880
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,160
across

881
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,400
then there would be no information on

882
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,680
hidden State given the outcome

883
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,240
The Other Extreme would be perfect

884
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,700
information with the identity Matrix and

885
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,460
you can see that it's also rescaled so

886
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,320
the numbers can be shown kind of Simply

887
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,760
as integers

888
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,400
and then it's rescaled so that it's a

889
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,020
proper probability

890
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,940
so seventy percent of the time the

891
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,940
musician hits their intended note

892
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,040
Row one column one seven

893
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,060
B is the probability of transitions

894
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,520
so we can go if we go from Node 1 to

895
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,540
Note 2 with 97 so notice the diagonal

896
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,599
if that was the identity Matrix on B if

897
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,520
that was all B was

898
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,280
you would basically dwell wherever you

899
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,660
began

900
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,040
if b is all off diagonal you never stay

901
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,020
in the same spot twice

902
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,660
and so here is a sequence

903
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,839
of notes because one almost always moves

904
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,760
to two two almost always moves to three

905
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,160
three almost always moves to four and

906
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,720
four almost always moves to one

907
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:09,300
then D is the prior and so it's just

908
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,040
being taken as a noiseless estimate that

909
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,020
the first note is the beginning note

910
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,520
Michael

911
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,339
so is this a very boring tune that plays

912
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,520
Four notes in the in the round

913
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,319
eternally

914
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,839
exactly like this it's like Geb in

915
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,960
Eternal Golden Braid except it's like g

916
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,240
e b

917
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,460
x g e b x okay very boring yeah okay yes

918
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,680
it is a simple one

919
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,099
so 7.1 to 7.3 equations completely

920
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,680
specify the hmm note that it's a hidden

921
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,940
Markov model

922
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,220
because it has this partially observable

923
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,660
character but it's not a decision

924
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,099
process because there's no action

925
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,640
selection but all we needed to do was to

926
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,520
specify a b and d

927
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,420
so to totally specify the hmm was ABD we

928
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,500
didn't have to say which notes we

929
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,880
preferred we didn't have to say anything

930
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,660
about what we could do with C or E

931
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,980
okay

932
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,599
then there are some simulations shown

933
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,520
um there's a few things about this

934
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,160
simulation first as the earlier question

935
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,400
has raised why are there continuous

936
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,839
interpolations when we're in the

937
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:26,520
discrete time world

938
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,119
a general comment is these graphs with

939
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,099
multiple block lines

940
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:33,900
are a little hard to interpret because

941
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,020
of course we can't tell which line is

942
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,520
which

943
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,099
another issue with 7.2 figures

944
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:43,200
specifically is the bottom left quadrant

945
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,119
is empty

946
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,640
so just a few points but what's

947
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,160
basically happening is in this

948
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,680
simulation run which would only happen

949
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,839
this way

950
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,760
um several percent of the time but

951
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,380
they're showing it

952
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,540
um basically

953
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,560
um in the upper right

954
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,300
um

955
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,700
the retrospective beliefs are shown

956
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,099
so the retrospective beliefs

957
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,680
are shown with a correct song

958
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,440
even though the actual observations were

959
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,819
were note one two two four

960
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,760
so this observation

961
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,200
was recognized and it did increase the

962
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,660
posterior on Note 3 being played

963
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,079
however because the belief was so strong

964
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,839
that belief that Note 3 would be played

965
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,220
in this time

966
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,819
it did not move the needle far enough to

967
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,040
actually hear that note

968
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,200
so that's like when somebody hears

969
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,300
something that isn't said because it's

970
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,319
likely that it was set

971
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,780
okay so that's a fun model but it's not

972
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,060
action inference yet so that's where we

973
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,859
get to 7.3 where we've been spending a

974
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,160
lot of today's discussion

975
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,440
7.3 discusses the addition of an extra

976
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,180
variable on which transition

977
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,460
probabilities are conditioned so it's

978
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,980
like really when we think B we should

979
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,880
really think B vertical line pi

980
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,880
because the inference on action means

981
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,760
that if that we have actual options for

982
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,960
action

983
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,640
which is to say

984
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,400
there are multiple B's that can

985
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,980
influence how s unfolds

986
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,079
so we're really talking about B's

987
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,440
condition on on policy unless we're

988
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,760
talking about like the whole B

989
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,020
caterpillar the whole tensor of B

990
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,200
foreign

991
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,480
here's where

992
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,400
um expected free energy

993
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,640
and one of the partitionings is shown

994
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,079
which is discussed in chapter two

995
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,680
equation 2.6 and in chapter four so next

996
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,839
week when we're in chapter seven for the

997
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,520
second time let's can let's return talk

998
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,660
a little bit more about the technical

999
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,440
parts of like what exactly equation 7.4

1000
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,119
means

1001
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:06,960
um

1002
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,240
it's a decomposition

1003
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,500
that enables epistemic drive towards

1004
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,900
information gathering that's this first

1005
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,599
part of the right hand side and the

1006
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,220
pragmatic Drive

1007
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,079
which is about

1008
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,380
realizing prior beliefs

1009
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,839
reducing surprise about prior beliefs

1010
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,800
not maximizing a reward function

1011
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,780
reducing diversions between preferences

1012
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,180
and outcomes

1013
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,760
they're going to unpack the full

1014
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,440
7.3 figure

1015
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,560
in the context of a t mace which is a

1016
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,859
rat that's able to go left or right to

1017
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,380
find food or not

1018
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,780
or it's able to get a cue

1019
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,500
that's the Q location r

1020
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,160
there's four locations that it can be in

1021
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,800
and there's modular degrees of freedom

1022
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,180
in how different things are represented

1023
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,740
so this isn't even the only way to

1024
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,480
represent this

1025
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,579
toy example

1026
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,520
but this Matrix does a really good job

1027
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,440
of showing like

1028
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,260
what are the states what are the

1029
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,060
dimensionality

1030
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,000
of the difference variables which we can

1031
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,800
come to next week

1032
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,579
so here's context two here's context one

1033
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,619
here we have block on the right side

1034
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,300
white on the left

1035
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,280
here we have block on the left white on

1036
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,180
the right

1037
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,180
and there are some subtle differences

1038
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,040
which you can note like specifically

1039
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,140
with lines two and three here's a one

1040
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,460
here

1041
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,740
here's a one on the third line

1042
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,740
because the Q is suggesting that it's on

1043
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,760
the right

1044
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,980
here the queue is showing it's on the

1045
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,640
left and in model stream 7.2

1046
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,940
that example is like very Hands-On and

1047
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,400
in some ways even better than this one

1048
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,980
and it includes things like learning but

1049
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,260
it's a very similar task

1050
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,440
here is B2

1051
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,599
so they're showing the dimensionality of

1052
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,079
what those B slices look like for

1053
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,300
different policies

1054
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,700
this is representing the B tensor

1055
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,579
here are preferences

1056
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,900
this is what a preference Vector looks

1057
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,079
like and in step by step the paper and

1058
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,240
model stream one series and in model

1059
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,880
stream 7 Series there's some discussion

1060
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,720
on what does c mean is it being

1061
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,339
reflected as log probabilities

1062
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,619
why would one do six and negative 6

1063
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:56,760
versus 6 000 a negative 6000 or 0.6 and

1064
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,339
negative point six what if those values

1065
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,260
actually mean

1066
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,900
and the prior is provided

1067
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,420
so now that we've provided a

1068
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,740
controllable B

1069
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,560
which is the manifestation of policy

1070
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,640
options

1071
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,040
and provided a c

1072
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,339
we can do active inference because we

1073
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,759
have now

1074
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:22,020
what we need

1075
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,119
those two pieces really that's what

1076
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,700
brought us from the hmm to the pomdp was

1077
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,760
what we can do and what we prefer

1078
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,859
um section 7.4 goes into information

1079
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,119
seeking it unpacks the epistemic value

1080
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,180
into a few more sub decompositions

1081
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,960
and it talks about how that plays out

1082
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,780
there's some Nuance here again there's

1083
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,780
also some

1084
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,359
semi-confusing black and white graphs

1085
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,359
but other ones are clear

1086
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:57,780
we can talk about how epistemic value is

1087
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,420
being realized in this example

1088
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,400
box one

1089
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,780
is a a bit of a uh side note

1090
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,540
on uncertainty and precision

1091
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,059
and here's showing really the

1092
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,400
temperature or the Precision highest

1093
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,260
temperature

1094
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,640
lowest entropy most uniform distribution

1095
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,400
lowest temperature highest entropy most

1096
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,319
specific distribution

1097
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,359
here you're sharpening

1098
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,180
here you're blurring

1099
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,359
okay 7.9 as mentioned um

1100
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,839
two pages earlier is an icicate

1101
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,760
so

1102
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,900
um

1103
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,420
there are four locations

1104
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,359
and the eyes are cicading again one

1105
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,040
could ask about where are these

1106
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,780
continuous interpolations coming from

1107
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,660
since we're in chapter seven in a fully

1108
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,400
discrete situation

1109
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,660
but it's all good so isocating different

1110
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,200
sequences or traces of isocades across

1111
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,760
four locations

1112
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,800
driven by epistemic value

1113
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,579
in section 7.5

1114
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,359
learning and Novelty is introduced so as

1115
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:28,140
we were mentioning earlier learning with

1116
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,200
respect to the a or the B Matrix

1117
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,599
so far we've been talking about them as

1118
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,040
fixed

1119
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,660
here is where learning happens on a and

1120
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,760
b and just like you would do with any

1121
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,220
Bayesian inference whether on action or

1122
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,020
on the consequences of action or on

1123
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,280
perception

1124
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,599
learning is modeled as a hyper prior or

1125
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,480
a variable that governs a prior on

1126
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,880
another parameter so here is like a

1127
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,559
parameter

1128
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,140
um that is adding a layer

1129
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,079
to the rake we still see the core figure

1130
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,579
4.3 figure 7.3 Motif but there are these

1131
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,619
new little edges

1132
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,220
that are the learning edges so it's the

1133
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,099
same pumdp as figure 7.3

1134
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,900
but the priors for each hidden States

1135
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,180
now depend on the variables which

1136
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,700
themselves come with prior beliefs so

1137
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,660
the prior on the variables A and B

1138
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,300
is in the Bayesian Paradigm how we learn

1139
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,780
or update our values on a and b

1140
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,859
um

1141
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,440
brief discussion on College of priors

1142
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,260
some more equations

1143
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,200
that we can come to next week about

1144
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,078
updating and learning on a

1145
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,960
another look in equation 711

1146
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,000
on G

1147
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,040
which is very similar to what we saw in

1148
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,099
equation 2.6 different partitionings on

1149
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,780
expected free energy a policy

1150
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,599
then there's a final example that's now

1151
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,160
in a maze

1152
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,660
and so this is some maze seeking entity

1153
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,859
we can come to this next week

1154
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,140
um in hierarchical inference

1155
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,640
hierarchical or deep inference something

1156
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,260
we kind of mentioned today but we'll

1157
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,839
look more at next week

1158
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,000
is um well first there's a box on

1159
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,400
structure learning

1160
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,040
which as mentioned earlier is when we

1161
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,319
think about look regular non-structured

1162
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:38,640
learning as like fine-tuning

1163
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,579
quantitative parameters within a given

1164
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,280
dimensionally defined generative model

1165
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,079
structure learning and what you can do

1166
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,579
with structure learning like

1167
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,920
specifically Bayesian model reduction is

1168
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,240
when we're actually modifying the

1169
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,460
dimensionality of the generative model

1170
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,819
that's in box 7.3

1171
00:54:56,819 --> 00:55:01,079
here is a nested generative model which

1172
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:02,819
is almost exactly the form that we

1173
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:05,099
looked at from live stream 42

1174
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,260
where we see like the rake classical

1175
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,859
figure 4.3 figure 7.3 Paradigm and then

1176
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,900
there's like a meta break

1177
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,780
where here's another E downward facing

1178
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,420
and we have policy at a higher level and

1179
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,160
different generative models have taken

1180
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,500
different interpretations on what the

1181
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,599
lower and the higher level are like in

1182
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:27,119
live stream 42 the lower level was

1183
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,980
tactical movement of a robot and the

1184
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,420
