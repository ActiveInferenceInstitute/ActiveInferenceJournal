1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,200
so

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,600
okay hello everyone thanks for joining

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,559
this second meeting of the second cohort

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,639
of the active inference textbook group

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,480
where we're going to be discussing

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,840
chapter one

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,400
today is september 9th 2022

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,560
so i'll minimize this and you guys can

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
click on my screen and that will show

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
you the full screen of what i am

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
presenting

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
so what we'll do in the live meetings

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
here for the next two and a half months

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
or so is totally going to be driven by

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,360
the material that's in the chapters

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
and in the appendices

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
so we're going to go to the questions

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
page and we're going to look at the

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,879
questions that have been asked for that

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,680
week for that theme and we're just going

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
to start with the most upvoted questions

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
so here you can upload a question like

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,559
this by

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,239
clicking thumbs up

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,920
um so we will start with the most

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,879
upvoted questions and then we can take

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,320
notes here and the discourse in this

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,840
answers in this course and if you just

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,799
click on that it opens this page and

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
anybody is free to write here

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
and after addressing the questions which

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,799
is probably going to be most of the time

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040
and discussing them

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,080
then

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
we will

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,320
move on to maybe look at the ideas more

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
broadly

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
over here

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
so we don't really have too many

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,439
questions if anybody wants to jump in

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,880
and

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,240
write a question

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
we did send an email reminder that um

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,759
because this was pretty empty

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
over the course of the week but

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,920
hopefully thinking by writing in this

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,240
way will be a structure where we'll be

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,799
able to hear everyone's perspective and

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
leave the coda in a better place than we

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
found it so if anybody wants to jump in

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,119
and write additional questions in the

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
coda now would be a good time

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
and then after looking at the questions

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
we will pull back and focus a little bit

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,159
more broadly so maybe we'll go over here

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,560
to touch on the ideas and insights of

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
the chapter

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
and then ideas for that week and then in

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,239
the last minutes we can just see if

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,840
there's been any

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,920
changes to the project ideas and start

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,599
to see what people are excited about

63
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
applying active inference to

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
um

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
and then we will end at the top of the

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
hour

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,319
so let's just head over to the questions

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
the cohort 2 questions page and take a

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,560
couple minutes to put some questions in

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,360
here

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
um so just so you guys know control plus

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
and control minus are good ways to

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
scroll in and out to get like the right

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,080
view of the screen

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
and then you can hide this little

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
textbook bar over here so i'm going to

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
hide that and just give everybody maybe

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
like five minutes to

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
put in a question or something they

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
would maybe like to discuss from chapter

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
one of

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,519
the textbook

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,560
so

84
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:23,660
[Music]

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
foreign

86
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,520
so

87
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,490
[Music]

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
so

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
so maybe we could just take like one

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,479
more minute and wrap up these questions

91
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,300
[Music]

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,639
and just want to say like to everyone at

93
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
any point that there's always the

94
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,960
affordance of just listening and also of

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,759
just

96
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
re-watching this recording

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
there's also the affordance in gather to

98
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
raise your hand

99
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,479
um see if i can show where that is

100
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,039
um boy it's been a long time

101
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,240
over here there it is down at the bottom

102
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,199
so there's this raised hand feature

103
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,680
and lower hand

104
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
um

105
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,759
yeah okay

106
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,080
let's see

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
um

108
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
and then

109
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
if you would you can raise your hand if

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
you would like to share just on that um

111
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
particular question and we're going to

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
have them up in the coda

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
and you can also pull up the answers um

114
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
in the discourse and that will pull up

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,280
the focused view of the question

116
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
and everybody um is free to

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
collaboratively like edit the answers

118
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
here in the discourse

119
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,199
it's better to really add and be noisy

120
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
even if it's just like a bullet point

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,039
list or an incomplete thought or if

122
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,560
there's incoherence or if it's

123
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
contradictory those are all fine it just

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
adds information and perspective on the

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
question

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
um so yeah we're going to open up each

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
question the answers in the discourse

128
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,639
and read what has been read and already

129
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,280
contributed in the answers and then also

130
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
people want to share other thoughts that

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
they're having that's awesome and then

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,319
if anybody also just wants to be taking

133
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
notes just things that are coming to

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
mind or they don't want to share in a

135
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,639
speaking way or just taking some notes

136
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,440
on what other people are saying

137
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
so this is really a participatory uh

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,919
group and

139
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,680
so we it's just is what we make it here

140
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
um

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
okay cool i actually this little window

142
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,639
opener i won't see any raised hands and

143
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
gather

144
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
all right let's see

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,160
i need a double screen

146
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,199
all right let's see if i can do it in

147
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,720
this small way

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
okay

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
cool

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,280
um all right so let's get into it this

151
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,000
first question i'll pop it open

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,720
and it says

153
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
what is the difference between a

154
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,960
stimulus response mapping and a state

155
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
action policy

156
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
um

157
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,199
so i don't know does anybody have any

158
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
ideas here i'm not i think that they're

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
both um kind of like an if this then

160
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,039
that

161
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,760
but

162
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
they're specific i think to machine

163
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
learning so if anybody has um any of

164
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
like more depth or background

165
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
in this area that would be awesome to

166
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
hear

167
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
so i don't know the way i kind of think

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
about it oh is that uh arun did you

169
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,760
raise your hand

170
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,640
yeah

171
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
can you hear me yeah cool

172
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
i can give a very i can give an attempt

173
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
at an answer to that

174
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,519
um

175
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,480
which

176
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
from my understanding and please tell me

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
if i'm wrong um when you've got the

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
stimulus response mapping

179
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
you've you're con you've got 100

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
certainty on what the stimulus is

181
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,800
so with the states you're then factoring

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
in beliefs about

183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
you've got uncertainty so maybe you just

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
you know at a simple form you could be

185
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
chucking a gaussian distribution on

186
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
every stimulus and then a gaussian

187
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,839
distribution on

188
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
what your response is

189
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
to go from state to go from stimulus

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
response mapping to state action policy

191
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
that's my intuitive understanding of

192
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
what's going on but again please tell me

193
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
if i'm barking on

194
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
the wrong track

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
yeah that's awesome thanks for um

196
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
sharing and i kind of think about it in

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
the same way like i i don't know i mean

198
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
this is probably totally wrong but like

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
i think like about the roomba

200
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
like the little vacuum that cleans your

201
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
house um and so like if you turn it on

202
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
it turns on and moves like that's a

203
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
stimulus like you push the button and

204
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
then it turns on and then um like it

205
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
moves around because you pushed the

206
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
power button like it's a very clear

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
thing versus like the state action like

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,480
if it's it's full

209
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
like if the vacuum gets full then it

210
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
like dumps out but like that state of

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
fullness is like a right like a

212
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,399
distribution right like so it can be

213
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
like more or less full and it senses how

214
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
far it is away from the dump out bucket

215
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
or whatever so that's like the state

216
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,399
action like the state can be full but

217
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,480
like what like what is too full for the

218
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,839
roomba like is it a certain weight

219
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,920
that's in there or like a certain volume

220
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
or sensor i don't know

221
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
i have i have uncertainty about when the

222
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
room dumps itself out

223
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,839
cool awesome

224
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
so we can just write this in here so um

225
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
and anyone's free to take notes and type

226
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,640
in here

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
okay cool all right

228
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,040
so um yeah and anyone's free to just get

229
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,760
in here and

230
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,800
jump in and and do this

231
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
all right so

232
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
let's look

233
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,279
uh

234
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,720
let's look at this one

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,760
all right so this question says

236
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,720
is the brain trying to maximize qualia

237
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,440
divergence and minimize encoding length

238
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
ali

239
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
sorry i raised my hand before um i was

240
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
just wanted to add some comments about

241
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
the previous question uh because i think

242
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
it's a very important one um you see uh

243
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
as we go on uh

244
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,279
specifically specifically in the chapter

245
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
four when we encounter the concept of

246
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,560
markup blanket uh will i think

247
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,760
we can see uh kind of more uh granular

248
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
differences between those two concepts

249
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,639
between uh stimulus stimulus response

250
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,839
mapping and

251
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,279
state action policy but briefly states

252
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,399
are just representations of um

253
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,959
internal or external world

254
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,600
right and actions are

255
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,279
specifically uh goal-directed called

256
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
goal-oriented responses and

257
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,079
they

258
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,320
just try to

259
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
change the state

260
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,880
of the system or the agent but when

261
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
we're talking about uh just uh stimulus

262
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,639
response mapping i mean response uh

263
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
doesn't necessarily tries to change the

264
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
state of the agent uh as a as an example

265
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
uh if you touch a

266
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,279
hot object

267
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
the pain you feel is just a response

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,399
right but if you move away your hand

269
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,639
from that hot object it's an action

270
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
which tries to change

271
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,160
the stimulus and one other important

272
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,600
distinction here is

273
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
the term policy

274
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
is used in a different sense in active

275
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
inference literature as compared to

276
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,519
reinforcement learning literature

277
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,480
namely

278
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,160
in reinforcement learning this term

279
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,959
is often used to refer to

280
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
singular mappings or one-to-one mappings

281
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
from states to actions but in active

282
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,480
inference literature policy

283
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,959
usually refers to possible sequence of

284
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,959
actions not just a singular action so

285
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,079
that's i think one important

286
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,000
distinction we need to have in mind also

287
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
cool awesome thank you very much and i

288
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,959
looked that up actually

289
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,399
um

290
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,920
so here like i think that um

291
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
when they talked about state action

292
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,600
policies they were using it in the

293
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,839
machine learning case because it says

294
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,279
in the textbook the goal directed

295
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
character of action and active inference

296
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
is in keeping with early cybernetic

297
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,040
formulations but distinct from most

298
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,839
current theories that explain behavior

299
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
oh sorry someone's talking could you

300
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,079
please mute

301
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,519
thank you

302
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,800
um

303
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
so it says

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
uh

305
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
distinct from most current theories that

306
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,199
explain behavior in terms of stimulus

307
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,360
response mappings or state action

308
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,240
policies so i think that this here um

309
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
they're not talking about um the act of

310
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
inference state action policies but

311
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,839
they're using it in the reinforcement

312
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
learning way so it says also stimulus

313
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
response or habitual behavior then comes

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
a special case of a broader family of

315
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,839
policies in active inference so i think

316
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,920
that the the way that they were talking

317
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,079
about it in the textbook refers to the

318
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
reinforcement learning way as opposed to

319
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
the active inference way which only is

320
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,360
correct it's definitely um different

321
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
any other comments or thoughts on this

322
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
question

323
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
and thank you for whoever is taking

324
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,440
notes in the coda that's always super

325
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,440
helpful

326
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
okay

327
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,639
so we can move on and look at this

328
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,519
question is the brain trying to

329
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,639
maximize qualia divergence and minimize

330
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
encoding length

331
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,000
who has some thoughts here

332
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,519
just um

333
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,720
the idea of maximizing qualia divergence

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
seems like

335
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
at some point that's beyond

336
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,959
schizophrenic maybe um so there's like

337
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
some maybe

338
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,480
thresholded which

339
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
you would not want to go beyond

340
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,190
um

341
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,959
[Music]

342
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,680
and that has seems to have some to me

343
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,120
seems to have something to do with

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,839
epistemic value

345
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
you can't just maximize try to try to

346
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,839
maximize your epistemic value forever

347
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,199
you would

348
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,480
into a

349
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,800
pragmatic problem

350
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,559
that's encoding length

351
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,879
um

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,160
so i'm just i guess i'm wondering if uh

353
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
maybe a

354
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
a different framing of the question or

355
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,319
commensurate framing of the question is

356
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
what's the relationship between

357
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,520
epistemic value and pragmatic value like

358
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,959
are there trade-offs there

359
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
yeah i scanned through um chapter one

360
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
and really didn't see a

361
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,679
quality of divergence or encoding length

362
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,039
um

363
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,880
there in the chapter

364
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,200
so i'm not really um

365
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,919
yeah

366
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,440
does is this anyone's question do you

367
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,720
want to unpack this question a little

368
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,760
bit more for us maybe

369
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
no volunteers

370
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
awesome

371
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,360
daniel thanks for joining us i will i

372
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
can officially uh

373
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
pass the baton off to you and maybe you

374
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
have some comments about

375
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,960
maximizing qualia divergence or

376
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
minimizing encoding length here but we

377
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
got in and we wrote a few questions and

378
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
we went through the first one uh we

379
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
could also go back and touch on that if

380
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
you've got comments on on that as well

381
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,880
that

382
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
questions just makes me wonder

383
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
what is being minimized what is being

384
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,600
maximized

385
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
and when is it

386
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,400
some

387
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,480
particular value that's being minimized

388
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
or maximized and when is it the

389
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
divergence

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,440
between

391
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
which other

392
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,480
um differences and in chapter one there

393
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,360
aren't

394
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
any of the formalisms yet

395
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,960
but

396
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
we'll see a lot of

397
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,000
um

398
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,840
double lines

399
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,120
and kl divergences that will

400
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
cue us towards where a divergence is

401
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,720
being at least described

402
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
cool

403
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,919
if you're ready i can unshare my screen

404
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,280
and you can

405
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
take over but please please continue

406
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
okay

407
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,799
um

408
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,039
any more additional additional comments

409
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,039
here

410
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
i like this

411
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,919
is oh yeah i thought didn't get to write

412
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,120
this down

413
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,880
but brock had mentioned qualia

414
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
divergence

415
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,320
schizophrenia

416
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,400
beyond schizophrenia that was the term

417
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
diversity you can imagine is necessary

418
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
and some more might be really healthy

419
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,640
and useful

420
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,440
but at some point

421
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,880
i don't

422
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
then you're

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
you have multiple personalities or

424
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
something i don't

425
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
that makes me think of um

426
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,640
the sense of normalcy

427
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
and what is experienced as normal

428
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,679
and how much of a

429
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,760
um

430
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,240
how much of a deviation from normal is

431
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
perceived as

432
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
like

433
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
what what

434
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
what is perceived as normal

435
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
and where is it perceived as a creative

436
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
and maybe even enjoyable

437
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
novelty like a guitar solo

438
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,840
and then where is the quality of

439
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,200
divergence too high and maybe

440
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
uncomfortable

441
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
and then what's the view from the inside

442
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
with that actual experience like what

443
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,039
qualia brings in

444
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,559
and then where where is this being

445
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,280
modeled from the outside

446
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,480
with behavioral descriptions

447
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
where we we might not be able to

448
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
directly address

449
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
what the qualia are

450
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,919
and daniel that reminds me like some of

451
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,760
it might be you said some of it might be

452
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
normal and some of it might be

453
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,159
uncomfortable and or some of it might be

454
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
some divergence might be creative and

455
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
some might be uncomfortable and there's

456
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,000
actually like a huge degree of um

457
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
of like mental disorder associated with

458
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
creativity like i mean studies have been

459
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
done and it's like i mean you like i

460
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
mean there's the classic like you know

461
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,919
songwriter singer who commits suicide

462
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,520
and we hear this again and again but

463
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,280
there's actually like a great degree of

464
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,159
mapping between the creative type and

465
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,039
some kind of atypical mental state

466
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,640
so maybe both of those are the the same

467
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,600
okay cool anybody have any comments

468
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
i don't know if i can see everybody in

469
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
my tiny screen go ahead sorry hello hi

470
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
it's not clear to me what real what they

471
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
precisely means equality diver

472
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,880
divergence because

473
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,280
divergence with respect to what

474
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,559
i mean usually a kl divergence is a

475
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,679
divergence of um like a measure of the

476
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,480
difference between two distribution so

477
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
here

478
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
what does exactly mean maybe the person

479
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
asking the question

480
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,520
and clarify

481
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
i'll also just know that they'll go bro

482
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,400
sorry i was just i don't

483
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,159
i don't know if they're here because we

484
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,000
already asked but

485
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,720
to me it just seems like uh internal

486
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,080
kind of

487
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
population of one qualia set another

488
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
qualia set

489
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,280
that are differentiable like

490
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,799
you can have divergence certainly of

491
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,919
qualia

492
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,159
uh in your own experience if you just

493
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,400
consider you know the various sensory

494
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,919
[Music]

495
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,799
kind of experiential states that you

496
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,760
you occupy like okay so that means that

497
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
would mean um

498
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000
like expanding the range of uh

499
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
of your

500
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
phenomenology something like that

501
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
obviously

502
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
yeah so um

503
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,720
yeah so you could imagine a sense of

504
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,880
space and self

505
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,840
you know that's kind of

506
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
uh frequent and normative that if that

507
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,799
starts to

508
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,600
um

509
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,280
maybe in a religious or spiritual

510
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,799
setting or

511
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,039
other kind of group team settings it's

512
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,559
you know you kind of get a group flow

513
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,559
going maybe like that that starts to

514
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,520
change

515
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,279
but but maybe

516
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,279
if those two things greatly diverge that

517
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
wouldn't be great

518
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
so that maybe is related to the

519
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
complexity of that part of the model

520
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
that encodes

521
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,600
um a representation of the self

522
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
so that would increase the complexity of

523
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
the

524
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,520
of the model which is one part

525
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,080
one part of

526
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
of the free energy minimization scheme

527
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,480
so the

528
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,159
i guess i mean with each increase in the

529
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,520
epistemic

530
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,320
uh import of uh

531
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,919
of the

532
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,840
of

533
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,520
observation then

534
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
also complexity of the model though

535
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,720
needs to be kept at bm

536
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,679
within

537
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,720
within some limit

538
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,559
so

539
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,120
inside your blanket so it yeah so it's

540
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,200
probably it's a trade-off between

541
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
increasing the complexity of the model

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
for what concerns

543
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,799
the range of possible experiential

544
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
qualia

545
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,760
and their epistemic value i guess

546
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,320
also just mention out of uh fairness

547
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
that qualia is not mentioned in the

548
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
textbook

549
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,559
but it's totally awesome to consider

550
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
what the formalisms entail for

551
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
philosophy and many papers and many

552
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
discussions do and it's like an

553
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,279
important area to explore

554
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,240
but it's also not what is um

555
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
addressed and i i think it's probably

556
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
even though these authors in other

557
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
settings

558
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,559
tackle the problem

559
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,559
head on

560
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,320
the textbook

561
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
is

562
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
seemingly crafted

563
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
to enable some discussions that might

564
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
not

565
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
require

566
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,559
the consideration of the view from the

567
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,200
inside or the phenomenology

568
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,279
that qualia entail

569
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,720
and that helps the generality

570
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
of the

571
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,080
and the applications across different

572
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,559
systems

573
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
and so understanding how they map onto

574
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,760
our

575
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,400
undeniable experience is a great

576
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,279
area to explore

577
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,919
[Music]

578
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,159
no no i was saying that overall the book

579
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,279
doesn't

580
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,400
doesn't expand too much on the on the

581
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,679
part of the model that represents the

582
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
the agent itself

583
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,720
as a

584
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
you know

585
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,320
as an entity like you know our own

586
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
self-representation

587
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
that

588
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,080
it it mentions it but does not really

589
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,279
does not really dwell onto it

590
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,520
more about that is probably in the book

591
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,960
of uh jacob hoey

592
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,640
there's a little bit more on that but

593
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
in this one not so much

594
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,799
well perhaps this connects to the um

595
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,880
following question

596
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,400
on self-evidencing

597
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,360
so before we jump forward um

598
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,880
i like i just want to stay on this

599
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,960
question for one second so i i looked up

600
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,279
the definition of qualia here um and

601
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,840
it's the the individual instances of

602
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
subjective conscious experience and i

603
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,159
don't know maybe

604
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,919
in the question which let's read it

605
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,159
again it says is the brain trying to

606
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,880
maximize qualia divergence and minimize

607
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,039
encoding length

608
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,840
um

609
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,240
so i was wondering if this maybe is

610
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
meant for a question like in an

611
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
evolutionary sense like is this what the

612
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,559
the brain is trying to do

613
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,080
um across time like in deep time

614
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
from you know

615
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,679
prehistory to now

616
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,840
so

617
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
um yeah we can move on though because

618
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
maybe um self-evidencing is

619
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,159
is uh more addressed in the book than

620
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,799
qualia divergence

621
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,880
um

622
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
yeah

623
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
so what does self-evidence and

624
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
inactivism really mean does anyone want

625
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,159
to take a stab here

626
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,919
yeah i ask the question because um when

627
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,039
i read

628
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,760
up

629
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,440
uh

630
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,679
my eyes just glaze over when i i hit

631
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,360
these words i i can read them in

632
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,440
sentences and i just

633
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
just doesn't stick in my

634
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,080
my head what what is really meant

635
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
self-evidencing just

636
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,080
it just turns into something

637
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
tautological

638
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
um

639
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,240
i don't have any sort of

640
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
real grasp but what is what is being

641
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,760
said in these sentences

642
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,360
i can take a step at that

643
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,399
because

644
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,960
really it's a it's a it's quite a simple

645
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,080
concept

646
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,600
so if we think about the agent

647
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
not as having

648
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
a model of the world

649
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,200
but being itself a model of its own

650
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,159
environmental niche

651
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,960
then minimizing free energy basically

652
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,580
means uh

653
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,480
[Music]

654
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,320
working acting

655
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,720
so as to

656
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
collect the

657
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
the observation

658
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,039
that it expects that is minimizing

659
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,240
surprise

660
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,960
so since

661
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,240
you can say

662
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,000
finding the evidence

663
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,799
for its model of the world

664
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,679
but since the agent is

665
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,039
a model of the world that becomes

666
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,679
self-evidencing

667
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
so basically

668
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,279
you could also see it

669
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,799
as trying to find the

670
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,840
sensory

671
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,799
stimulation that is um

672
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,000
that makes your phenotype your organism

673
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,520
viable

674
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,559
that sustains you so that's that's

675
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,880
evidencing me finding the observation

676
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,799
the sensory evidence

677
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
that is more coherent

678
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,679
with your

679
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,120
makeup as an organism

680
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,159
thanks

681
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,679
i'll add a few

682
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,320
notes so an activism is a

683
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,760
long-lived thread in cognitive sciences

684
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,039
that is

685
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,559
long existing before active inference

686
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,720
and it is describing

687
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,480
that systems with bodies

688
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,760
real particular things existing in the

689
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,960
world

690
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,399
ought to be

691
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,200
um having their cognition modeled

692
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,399
as bodies engaging with the world rather

693
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,720
than like them taking

694
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
like a view from the outside

695
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,240
or um

696
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
necessarily needing everything to be

697
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
like symbolic communication

698
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,120
whereas in digital systems or kind of

699
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,000
abstractions of cognitive systems it's

700
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,799
very easy to get into some information

701
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,960
and symbol passing

702
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
discussions

703
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,440
whereas

704
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,240
for

705
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,799
real systems with biomechanics

706
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,440
and embodiment inactivism brought

707
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
attention to the requirement of

708
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,399
considering like the active engagement

709
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
of an entity with its niche

710
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,279
so

711
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,880
maybe it's not um a term that provides a

712
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,799
huge cognitive model update because for

713
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,880
many people it's very natural

714
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,159
to consider

715
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,240
cognitive systems as inactive and

716
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,519
embodied

717
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,360
embedded and cultured et cetera et

718
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,519
cetera and sometimes that's called 4e

719
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,720
cognition

720
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
and those are all like in allegiance

721
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,279
together but that's what inactive points

722
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,240
towards

723
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,640
and self-evidencing

724
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,000
is describing that the imperative of

725
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,320
systems as modeled under active

726
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,679
inference

727
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,640
is for them to accrue consistent

728
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,240
observations

729
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,480
and find evidence for the kind of thing

730
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
that they

731
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,760
expect and prefer themselves to be

732
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,480
and

733
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
in the coming weeks we'll explore this

734
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,279
like expect and prefer and how can

735
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,279
expectations be preferences and what

736
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,799
about when we expect bad things to

737
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,799
happen and uncertainty about

738
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,799
expectations but

739
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,120
we can contrast this imperative for

740
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,799
finding consistent

741
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,720
self-consistent or self-evidencing

742
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,399
observations

743
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,960
rather than pursuing rewarding

744
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,559
observations

745
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,600
so one can say i expect and prefer to be

746
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,519
at room temperature

747
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,440
and then moving around the space or

748
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
putting the jacket on or off

749
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,000
to reduce surprise

750
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,279
about what observations one is receiving

751
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,600
as opposed to needing to construct a

752
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
reward framework

753
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,640
in which room temperature is rewarding

754
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
and then it gets less rewarding

755
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,279
and then what is being maximized is the

756
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,399
reward

757
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,640
of the cognitive system

758
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
and again in contrast self-evidencing

759
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
puts the imperative on

760
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
the system's self-model

761
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,840
and reducing surprise about its own

762
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,200
observations

763
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,679
rather than seeing those observations as

764
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,120
just proxy

765
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,200
of reward states that have to be

766
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
maximized

767
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,039
aaron

768
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,960
uh i found both of those answers really

769
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,679
interesting and i have a question to

770
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,280
each of those

771
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,239
um

772
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,320
so on the self evidencing

773
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
we have so maybe this is fast forwarding

774
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,679
a little bit in the book but they talk

775
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,199
about both generative models and

776
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
generative processes and those are

777
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,320
distinct

778
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
ideas so when we're talking about

779
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,560
an organism as a model in its niche

780
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,000
it's still distinct from the generative

781
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
process right so that's something that

782
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,839
i'm not 100 sure on and i also find the

783
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,918
self-evidencing part a little bit

784
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,000
circular and i don't quite have a good

785
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
understanding of that um

786
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,359
so

787
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,719
in my mind the gender model and the

788
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,199
gender process are very distinct and yes

789
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,879
you're looking for

790
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,239
you're an organism and you're in your

791
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,960
niche and you want to succeed and

792
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,040
by natural selection or whatever we only

793
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,359
really see organisms that succeed

794
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,400
um

795
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,839
they're going to look for things that

796
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,000
meet their priors such as you know a

797
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
nice

798
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,680
homeostasis food reproduction all of

799
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,119
that sort of stuff that's sort of my

800
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,359
understanding of that part but it's

801
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,280
still an organism using a model to

802
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,680
navigate the world rather than

803
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,400
it is a model itself

804
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
um and then also on the idea of the

805
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,560
minimizing free energy but also you know

806
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
it's not a reward

807
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
to me it sort of is a reward it's just a

808
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,920
reward with respect to a prior

809
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,280
distribution

810
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,160
so

811
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,640
yes you're minimizing free energy and

812
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
it's not and

813
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,839
you know you have a prior preference of

814
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,400
being at room temperature that's great

815
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,079
but you're still you still have an

816
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,400
object what an objective function

817
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,079
or functional i think as the book calls

818
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,960
it

819
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
you're just subtracting the prior

820
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,079
distribution of temperatures that your

821
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,520
body likes

822
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,640
um

823
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
so i still see that as like it's

824
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,480
fundamentally an optimization problem

825
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,079
it's just the units are a bit different

826
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,760
and it's all statistical distributions

827
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
and the differences between them rather

828
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,880
than

829
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
i don't know

830
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,079
x minus x bar squared

831
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,720
that sort of thing um so those are my

832
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,400
those are the areas i'm not very clear

833
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,160
on um so i don't know if anybody could

834
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,280
clear those up

835
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,359
thank you

836
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,160
thanks

837
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,599
so can i follow up on that then so on

838
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,440
the inactivism

839
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,359
i think the the problem is knowing what

840
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,560
the

841
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,599
the specific meaning of it is compared

842
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,440
with embodied

843
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,160
and embedded because those those e's are

844
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,440
so often used together

845
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,560
what is

846
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
where would you say an activism rather

847
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,920
than

848
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,480
embodied and i i think you touched on it

849
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,200
by saying about it involving him having

850
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
a model

851
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,560
maybe whereas being embodied

852
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
doesn't

853
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,720
i would suggest that inactive

854
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,800
calls the action

855
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,280
into focused whereas the embodiment in

856
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,359
the embedded refer to just the

857
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,040
materiality but the reason why they are

858
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,440
allegianced as 4e eeee etc

859
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
they're just fingers pointing at the

860
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,599
moon they're just fingers pointing at

861
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,079
real embodied organisms

862
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,160
and some of the complexities of modeling

863
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,560
them and framing them

864
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
in

865
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,720
contrast to disembodied approaches

866
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,599
so

867
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,119
um

868
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
they're pointing at organisms

869
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
and they're different theoretical

870
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,359
vectors that have been taken

871
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,200
and some of the synthesis amongst them

872
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,960
has already been carried out

873
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,650
yeah the an activism was

874
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,720
[Music]

875
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,359
became popularized the notion with the

876
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,240
francisco varela by francisco varela

877
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,800
actually and

878
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
i think

879
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,040
he was not he was not too fond of the

880
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,640
term actually but

881
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,599
anyway

882
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,960
he

883
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,520
the thing is that you wanted to stress

884
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,720
the

885
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,440
the fact that cognition and

886
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,960
consciousness emerges in the circularity

887
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,280
between

888
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,680
sensation and action

889
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,880
so

890
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,480
that was uh it was was enacted in the

891
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,560
circularity continuous circularity

892
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,599
of

893
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,000
action and sensation so

894
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,280
also feel it's

895
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,520
really close to

896
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
the free energy approach and active

897
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,520
imprint and so although there are some

898
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
of the

899
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
early uh

900
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,720
champions of an activism like um

901
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,000
evan thompson and and some other

902
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
scholars that

903
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,720
argue that there are actually crucial

904
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,839
differences but

905
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
anyway for what concerns the the

906
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,440
[Music]

907
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,520
the difference between the generative

908
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,760
process and the generative model the

909
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,480
generative process is basically

910
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,440
the actual physical processes that turns

911
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,119
causes into

912
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
stimuli into

913
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,920
that that impinge on our sensory

914
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,560
surfaces

915
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,320
the generative model is the best gas

916
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,440
that an organism

917
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,040
can make about that so they're not

918
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,119
[Music]

919
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,560
identical of course

920
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,160
[Music]

921
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
the the organism

922
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,960
tries to learn

923
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,599
at its best the

924
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,839
generative process but

925
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,960
you know it's just a model

926
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,400
um

927
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
ali

928
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,599
yes and i also wanted to mention um

929
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,280
jacob howie's

930
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,599
well-known paper the self-evidence in

931
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,800
the brain

932
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,280
which i believe is the seminal paper

933
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,200
which introduced this concept of

934
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
self-evidencing to active inference

935
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,400
literature

936
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,440
and uh in that paper he also contrasts

937
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,920
this term with inactivism in activists

938
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
and all the other

939
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,680
four e-cognition

940
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,000
[Music]

941
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,520
frameworks and theories but uh briefly

942
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,920
he believes that the self-evidencing

943
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,040
brain

944
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,480
by putting a boundary namely the markup

945
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,560
blanket

946
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,440
as

947
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,960
one of its essential components in order

948
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,640
for it to be able to infer

949
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,280
the states of the environment

950
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
it can

951
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,240
retain

952
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,800
its cognition within its inner

953
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,520
statistical or generative model

954
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,720
so

955
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
that's one of the reason uh the

956
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,839
self-evidencing concept was deemed

957
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,319
necessary to introduce

958
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,000
at the first place

959
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
so

960
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,800
and self-evidencing uh is something that

961
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,040
just uh is beyond uh

962
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,640
beyond the biological brain and it it

963
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,960
can refer more generally and more

964
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,560
broadly to

965
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,160
any agent

966
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,280
which

967
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,599
tries to learn about

968
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,200
its environment

969
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
as a

970
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
as a one dynamical system which tries to

971
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,920
perform inference about

972
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
the other dynamical system which is the

973
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,200
outside world

974
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,960
but with a

975
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,359
particular aim of trying towards

976
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,720
the minimizing the error or performing

977
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,920
the allostasis so to speak so

978
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,599
that's one of the main differences

979
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,400
between an activism and self-evidence in

980
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,119
concept here

981
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,599
it's also a very thank you um all for

982
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,240
sharing it's very illustrative to look

983
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,880
at figure 1.2

984
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,160
and see where these terms are used in

985
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,480
the context of the low road and the high

986
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
road to active inference

987
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,760
which is one of the key

988
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,400
concepts in this chapter

989
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
and it's describing how the following

990
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,960
chapters are going to be structured

991
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,640
so we see self-evidencing on this upper

992
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,680
branch

993
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,160
of the subway system

994
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,119
coming down from the high road

995
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,720
and we see some of these other terms

996
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,480
that people have been mentioning like

997
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,319
generative model

998
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,359
coming up from the low road and then in

999
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,560
the um

1000
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,640
in the same page that we were just

1001
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,839
discussing

1002
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,200
i copied some sections from the text

1003
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,880
that are describing these high and low

1004
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,160
road

1005
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,040
um

1006
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,520
they described that the high road

1007
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,119
is starting from the question of how

1008
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,119
living systems persist and act

1009
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,040
adaptively in the world

1010
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,480
and so that is very resonant with

1011
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,440
self-organization which is the first

1012
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,680
stop on that subway system from the high

1013
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,480
road

1014
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,720
and also um varela's work autopoesis a

1015
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,599
lot of questions about how

1016
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,119
cognizant sentient systems persist

1017
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,200
the high road perspective perspective is

1018
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,960
useful to understand

1019
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,920
what living organisms must do

1020
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,280
and why

1021
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,160
why

1022
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,640
to be persistent

1023
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,000
via surprise minimization not via reward

1024
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,599
maximization

1025
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,400
and then

1026
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,960
what they have to do so it's the what

1027
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,480
and the why

1028
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
in response to the broader question of

1029
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,880
how complex systems persist

1030
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,079
that's the high road and we've had many

1031
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,880
discussions and fun for every person to

1032
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,160
also

1033
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,920
think about this high road low road

1034
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,599
distinction but the high road is

1035
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,119
starting from

1036
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,000
a

1037
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
complex system

1038
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,240
thriving or persisting

1039
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,280
in a complex niche we can think of

1040
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,119
and then the low road

1041
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,000
is starting from bayes theorem

1042
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,760
and continues up through the bayesian

1043
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,040
brain

1044
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,880
also motivating active inference from a

1045
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,960
different direction

1046
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,200
and it is describing the low road

1047
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,359
perspective is useful to illustrate how

1048
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,359
active inference agents minimize their

1049
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,720
free energy

1050
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,520
well they're not necessarily doing

1051
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
frequentist statistics

1052
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,200
they're doing something that we can

1053
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,440
describe as bayesian

1054
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,480
and

1055
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,079
this textbook is going to introduce

1056
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,520
bayes theorem

1057
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,079
briefly in a box and it's a

1058
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,839
big area and some people will be

1059
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,960
familiar

1060
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
with thinking about priors and updating

1061
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
priors and the ways that that's

1062
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,520
discussed in bayesian statistics

1063
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,359
some will be familiar for some it might

1064
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,960
be novel

1065
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,720
but this is describing kind of the

1066
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,000
atomic

1067
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,119
computational or statistical

1068
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,520
uh nucleus

1069
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,720
that is going to describe how

1070
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,760
different

1071
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,560
systems can fulfill that imperative that

1072
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,280
we saw traced out by the high road and

1073
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
ali i know you'll have a lot to add on

1074
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,119
that

1075
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,400
uh i've also put a pdf to

1076
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,640
carver stream's essay beyond the desert

1077
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
landscape on

1078
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,119
resources and resources page and also on

1079
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,560
the chapter one

1080
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,680
uh questions and notes page uh

1081
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,400
i believe this essay is

1082
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,040
the most comprehensively articulated and

1083
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,599
in my opinion very beautifully even

1084
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,680
poetically articulated

1085
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,760
account of the high road and lower

1086
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,520
distinctions and the

1087
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,319
philosophical distinctions between them

1088
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,800
uh if you scroll down i think you can

1089
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,599
find the paper i've

1090
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,359
attached there

1091
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,319
yeah right at the bottom of the page

1092
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,720
and i've also inclu appended yeah that's

1093
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,560
it the

1094
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,830
carl for instance no

1095
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,040
[Music]

1096
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,640
below that yeah

1097
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,680
beyond the

1098
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,760
desert landscape uh and i've also

1099
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,880
appended uh andy clark's

1100
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,280
reply to this essay because uh this

1101
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,760
chapter comes from this book called andy

1102
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
clark and its critics

1103
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,520
which uh i think can uh help to

1104
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,800
understand

1105
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,040
uh the real differences between those

1106
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,920
two um concepts and

1107
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,160
why it's important

1108
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,280
to distinguish between them

1109
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
when we want to

1110
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,359
discuss and understand any

1111
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,319
uh

1112
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,079
active inference related concepts

1113
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,760
thank you awesome thanks i'm gonna just

1114
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,480
make note of that in here

1115
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,640
maybe

1116
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,240
just a comment on the why

1117
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,600
if you

1118
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,839
[Music]

1119
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,480
daniel uh

1120
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,359
like talking about the the high road

1121
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,280
that

1122
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,640
is it is it why really because

1123
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,839
my understanding really is uh

1124
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,839
the

1125
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,359
the perspective

1126
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,599
or the nature of the free energy

1127
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,280
principle is really a scar says is more

1128
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,160
tautological than teleological and why

1129
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,240
seems to point to

1130
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,440
some sort of teleology so it's

1131
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,319
go ahead go ahead

1132
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,040
yes

1133
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,000
scientific or formal addressments of

1134
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,640
teleology or end or goal directedness

1135
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,480
are very interesting

1136
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,240
and another

1137
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,599
framework or

1138
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,839
theory which is evolution

1139
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,200
has also

1140
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,800
threaded the needle

1141
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,319
with tautology and teleology

1142
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,480
and so there's a lot to be said there um

1143
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,640
about how

1144
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,040
those two categories aren't necessarily

1145
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,759
disjoint

1146
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,319
do you believe they have to be disjoint

1147
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,000
or are you expecting or preferring that

1148
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,280
they are

1149
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,280
um if the if the imperative is to

1150
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,040
persist and survive

1151
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,359
and we simply don't observe systems that

1152
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,119
don't

1153
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,400
then

1154
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,040
that phenomena can be both

1155
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,119
taught logical in the sense that it's

1156
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,359
self-describing

1157
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,559
as well as teleological in that from a

1158
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,800
perspective's view

1159
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,880
not speaking for the system itself but

1160
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,599
from our view on the system

1161
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,079
it is acting as if it is trying to

1162
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,040
survive

1163
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,800
the bubble is acting as if it's trying

1164
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,640
to get to the surface of the water

1165
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,160
in the sense that it's not acting like

1166
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,920
it's trying to go deeper

1167
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,240
we don't need to entail any qualia or

1168
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,280
any sort of broader theological reason

1169
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,720
for that to occur

1170
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,480
we can describe something that is both

1171
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,240
teleological and tautological

1172
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,559
yes well i i think i think i agree

1173
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,400
i think that

1174
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,599
uh

1175
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,200
from what

1176
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,000
what car or often says that it's you

1177
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,960
know deflationary accounts

1178
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
is that basically

1179
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,800
the

1180
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,680
uh

1181
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,520
the free energy principle

1182
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,400
basically basically describes

1183
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,880
a

1184
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,000
self-organizing system

1185
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,920
uh just because it persists and so

1186
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,720
what characteristics

1187
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,319
does it need in order to persist

1188
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,440
and so in in that sense is uh

1189
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,760
topological so

1190
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,880
it's just uh you know if it persists in

1191
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,559
it must behave like that

1192
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,599
so

1193
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,240
you don't even need to

1194
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,839
put in any imperative to survive if it

1195
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,319
survives it must behave like that but of

1196
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,319
course as you said you can

1197
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,359
frame this

1198
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,280
self-organizing drive in a sense as some

1199
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,400
sort of imperative to to maintain its

1200
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,559
form and function of the organism so

1201
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,960
there's a lot of interesting things to

1202
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,559
say about that and

1203
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,319
uh also

1204
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,680
one note is

1205
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,000
sometimes we speak in a mode of like

1206
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,520
what the imperative is for the system

1207
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,119
as itself

1208
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,160
in terms of what it normatively should

1209
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,880
or imperatively must be doing

1210
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,800
but also we can just speak from

1211
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,319
ourselves as modelers of other things

1212
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,720
as what our modeling imperatives are

1213
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,480
and that is a slightly different

1214
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,760
question

1215
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,359
and that's sometimes known as

1216
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,400
instrumentalism which can be compatible

1217
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,960
with realism of various flavors and it's

1218
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,000
been explored broadly

1219
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,359
however

1220
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,640
from our perspective as observers things

1221
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,200
that are not acting

1222
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,160
as to minimize their surprise relative

1223
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,119
to some area in space

1224
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,040
that makes us say it's that kind of a

1225
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,079
thing

1226
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,240
if it's not staying in that space which

1227
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,720
we're defining as that kind of thing

1228
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,440
it's not that thing

1229
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,319
if the tornado were not staying in some

1230
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,559
range of phase space that we call

1231
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,760
tornado

1232
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,640
it wouldn't be a tornado to us

1233
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,040
and so sometimes that can be a more

1234
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,119
empirically grounded

1235
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,599
and less speculative stance to have two

1236
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,680
feet as us

1237
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,079
as modeling systems

1238
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,319
which is going to be um consistent with

1239
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,079
the meta bayesian approach that's

1240
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,240
discussed later in the book

1241
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,359
and it

1242
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,839
sidesteps or it preempts a lot of very

1243
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,839
thorny questions

1244
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,319
around speaking for what systems like

1245
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,680
actually are or actually are doing

1246
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,280
and it's the difference between saying

1247
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,000
this the the thing is a model of its

1248
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,760
niche

1249
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
you know big if true

1250
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,960
we're going to model it as if it's

1251
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,920
a model of its niche

1252
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
it's irrefutable that's just a choice

1253
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,520
that we're taking and someone could say

1254
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,640
well i would have taken a different

1255
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,240
choice in modeling

1256
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,760
and you can say great what would your

1257
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,880
choice have been

1258
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,040
and there's actually a starting point

1259
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,200
instead of just this endless speculation

1260
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,079
around what is the system really

1261
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,599
and especially when we think about our

1262
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,319
markov blankets

1263
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,800
and our inability to make direct contact

1264
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,079
to hidden states

1265
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,520
it it bolsters the the

1266
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,960
justification of speaking as a modeler

1267
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,680
very cool

1268
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,920
um anybody else with comments on this uh

1269
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,720
question this self-evidencing and an

1270
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,400
activism which we could talk i'm sure

1271
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,960
all day about

1272
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,599
so if we just finish off that i think

1273
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,839
possibly this it's the language that's

1274
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,400
the problem with self-evidencing it just

1275
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,839
sounds as though it's

1276
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,200
self confirmatory

1277
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,280
all it's doing is looking for support

1278
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,319
bricks existence

1279
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,160
which is not a good strategy for

1280
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,720
survival

1281
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,640
uh why you say that

1282
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,720
well if if i only look for evidence of

1283
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,280
my existence rather than

1284
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,880
uh

1285
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,079
things that are a challenge to that

1286
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,160
uh

1287
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,399
then

1288
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,280
it i mean is possibly related to the

1289
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,559
dark room

1290
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,599
problem yes um exactly yeah

1291
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,400
so

1292
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,680
so

1293
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,680
in the for the sake of long-term

1294
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,559
uh persistence

1295
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,040
it may be necessary

1296
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,920
to

1297
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,440
incur

1298
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,760
sometimes transiently

1299
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,920
into states that are surprising so

1300
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,359
there is no

1301
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,680
real

1302
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,200
there's no real uh incoherence there i

1303
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,880
think

1304
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,640
no i i agree

1305
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,839
i'm just uh

1306
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,400
challenging it it's as a

1307
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,920
language

1308
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,359
a bit of a language barrier

1309
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,640
yeah great great point and indeed the

1310
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,800
natural language

1311
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,119
is often heavily shading interpretations

1312
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,520
and people's conceptions

1313
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,640
of different terms like around surprise

1314
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,520
belief expectation preference all these

1315
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,040
everyday terms

1316
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
which are core in the act of inference

1317
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,920
ontology it's really important to

1318
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,640
interrogate our understanding of them

1319
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,160
and check their alignment with

1320
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,440
formalisms

1321
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,340
and um

1322
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,520
[Music]

1323
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,799
this book

1324
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,240
is going to a large extent focus on the

1325
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,280
kernel

1326
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,040
of the active inference action

1327
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,720
perception loop

1328
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,359
single agent single level

1329
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,240
kernel

1330
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,319
and in that way it's very analogous to

1331
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,359
like a single linear regression now in

1332
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,480
practice

1333
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,040
linear aggression on large data sets

1334
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,599
does sweeps across families of models

1335
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,960
and there's all kinds of things that

1336
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,240
come into play just for the linear

1337
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,280
aggression

1338
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,440
that's the kernel and so

1339
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,000
in a nested model one could

1340
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,119
reduce

1341
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,000
um

1342
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,720
surprise and find confirmatory evidence

1343
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,480
i'm the kind of thing that seeks out

1344
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,200
novel information sources

1345
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,240
and

1346
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,319
therefore seeking out novel information

1347
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,200
sources is confirmatory evidence of that

1348
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,799
so once we step into multi-layer models

1349
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,319
many of the absolutely valid limitations

1350
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,280
of the kernel in and of itself

1351
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,960
are addressed

1352
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,799
so those are like all the directions

1353
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,040
that people's questions on

1354
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,040
and written down

1355
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,280
are super important

1356
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,799
they're all the things that that are

1357
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,119
direct adjacencies and relevant for

1358
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,280
applications

1359
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,040
and there's going to be things about

1360
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,440
real complex systems

1361
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,920
that the kernel does not describe

1362
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,119
totally

1363
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,280
so this isn't like

1364
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,559
the end of the active inference modeling

1365
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,599
of complex systems total book

1366
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,240
it really is just describing like the

1367
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,919
essence of the loop

1368
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,799
so i want to just give aaron the last um

1369
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,960
comment because it's the top of the hour

1370
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,440
now so

1371
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,200
yeah i just wanted to

1372
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,680
add to neil's question again like i

1373
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,799
fully understand where you're coming

1374
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,040
from neil uh when i first read about the

1375
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,559
self-evidencing thing i was like that

1376
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,640
makes zero sense and exactly what you

1377
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,799
described like oh okay you're not gonna

1378
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,880
look for predators like as a basic thing

1379
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,000
that's not evidence for my existence

1380
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,400
that's evidence for my death um but i

1381
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,839
think the way i've sort of come around

1382
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,200
to it is

1383
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,440
it's all about the prior preferences and

1384
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,280
what you expect to see

1385
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,960
um and

1386
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,319
yeah these this

1387
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,839
occupation of face space i think is

1388
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,400
quite important of you you sort of get

1389
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,000
attracted to particular states where

1390
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,359
you're comfortable

1391
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,680
but you do need to know about the rest

1392
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,319
of the world anyway and you have to plan

1393
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,040
for not being in those states sometimes

1394
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,680
um and so looking for evidence of your

1395
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,440
existence

1396
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,760
is all about matching those priors and

1397
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,000
those priors can be pretty flexible

1398
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,920
um so

1399
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
yeah that's i think that will

1400
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,760
in my mind like that comes through a bit

1401
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,400
later on in the book i think so

1402
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,319
i would say my advice do is stick with

1403
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,640
it um but it is it was very

1404
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,079
counter-intuitive to me as well when i

1405
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,960
first came across it
