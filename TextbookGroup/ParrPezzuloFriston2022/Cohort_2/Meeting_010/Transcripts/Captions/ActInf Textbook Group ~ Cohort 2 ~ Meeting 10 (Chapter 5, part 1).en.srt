1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,120
hello

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,779
this is active inference textbook group

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,700
cohort 2

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,019
we're in meeting 10 on November 4th 22.

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,660
and we're having our first discussion on

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,359
chapter five message passing and

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,580
neurobiology

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,160
so to begin

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,500
does anyone want to share

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,359
any general thoughts or remarks

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,960
on chapter five just

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,200
any experiences they had reading it

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
any topics that they thought they want

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,760
to discuss a little bit today just

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,340
anything about their reading of chapter

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,640
five

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,379
yes Ali

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,299
well I think in chapter five uh since

19
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,200
the authors decided to go uh pretty deep

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,180
into

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,979
neuroanatomical

22
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,860
structures or neuroanatomical uh

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,200
substrates of most of the active

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,420
inference Concepts uh well

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,600
having a kind of basic understanding of

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,759
neural neuroanatomy uh in my view is an

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
essential prerequisite to understanding

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,140
the contents of this chapter

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,939
uh but otherwise it provides some

30
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,259
empirical evidence for why active

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,439
inference modeling Works uh or

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,280
to put it this way it explains uh the

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,180
some of the testable

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,240
predictions we can get from applying uh

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,180
from seeing active inference from a

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,920
neuroanatomical perspective

37
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,520
awesome

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
thank you

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
anyone else want to share a general

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,180
thought on chapter five

41
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,660
yeah as Ali stated that chapter is going

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,620
to provide a host of examples which are

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,860
going to be discussed separately and

44
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,120
then synthesized together

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,519
regarding neurobiology specifically

46
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,920
mammalian neurobiology

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,099
which is one of the most important

48
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,980
systems of interest of us as humans and

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,680
also it's one of the most studied

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
in terms of different

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
um zones where active inference models

52
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,340
have been applied ranging from

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,280
as we'll see in this chapter the micro

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,019
circuit level

55
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,819
so the connectivity patterns of small

56
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,120
numbers of computational elements which

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,420
might be like neurons or it could be

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,679
brain regions

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,659
then there's a discussion of motor

60
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,099
commands

61
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,620
in terms of continuous time active

62
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,580
inference

63
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,220
and how motor

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,700
uh behaviors in the periphery are

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,099
coordinated

66
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,519
there are then several discussions about

67
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,220
decision making

68
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,659
neuromodulation and learning

69
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,060
and then there's a hierarchical hybrid

70
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,420
model that's presented which integrates

71
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,280
The Continuous and the discrete cases of

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,139
active inference in a unified generative

73
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,180
model and that's what brings it all

74
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,000
together in the summary

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,460
and also just one note maybe we've

76
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,320
mentioned before

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,820
um

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,160
chapter one provides an overview of the

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
book much like chapter 10.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,979
chapter 2 and 3 are the roads to active

81
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,960
inference but not active inference

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,919
itself

83
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,440
though it also kind of is

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,320
chapter 4 we learned about the essence

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,759
of specifying an active inference entity

86
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,440
which is its definition in terms of a

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,699
generative model

88
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,660
and now immediately we're moving to the

89
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,840
area with the most empirical support

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,780
and popular interest which is

91
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,580
understanding active inference in the

92
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,820
context of mammalian neuroanatomy and

93
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,440
that will conclude the first half of the

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,919
book which is the epistemic component

95
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,720
the second half of the book chapter six

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,540
through ten heads into some of the

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,960
step by step and recipes around

98
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
designing active inference models but in

99
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,440
some ways as we complete this last

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,320
chapter in the first half of our cohort

101
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,660
it's just good to keep in mind that like

102
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,960
we spent 60 percent of the time

103
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,240
getting into the game

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,699
then where the low and the high road

105
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,160
intersected was in the generative model

106
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,440
and now we're immediately going to be

107
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,120
talking about topics related to

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,020
applications

109
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,539
and specific generative models applied

110
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,199
to neurobiological phenomena in health

111
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,460
and in disease

112
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,139
okay

113
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,300
does anyone else want to add a comment

114
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,940
on chapter 5 before we start

115
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,960
moving through it

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,100
all right

117
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,880
chapter 4 described the generative model

118
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,740
in this chapter there's a focus on the

119
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,419
process theories arising from those

120
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,940
Dynamics theories that explain how the

121
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,860
brain May Implement variational

122
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,060
inference

123
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,840
so as per classical scientific Criterion

124
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,620
the goal of a theory or a contribution

125
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,740
is to variously explain predict design

126
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,000
control

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,759
these are the criteria that active

128
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,520
inference can and should be compared and

129
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,759
juxtaposed with other competing theories

130
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,639
and so many of these aspects are going

131
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,979
to be touched upon

132
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,500
explain and predict

133
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,900
and ultimately to design and control but

134
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,020
initially in this setting to explain and

135
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,060
predict so we'll be keeping an eye out

136
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,660
for unique and valuable explanations and

137
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,160
predictions

138
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,319
that active inference modeling of a

139
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,720
given system of Interest provides

140
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,660
in comparison with some other approach

141
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,680
that could be taken

142
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,479
let us take a step back from the

143
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,940
technical material of chapter four The

144
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,380
generative model

145
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,120
and turn our attention to the process

146
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,599
theories accompanying active inference

147
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,979
it's important to draw a distinction

148
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,960
between a principle like the free energy

149
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,099
principle

150
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,840
and a process theory about how the

151
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,819
principle may be implemented in a

152
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,919
certain kind of system such as the brain

153
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,360
the latter lets us develop hypotheses

154
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,539
that are answerable to empirical data so

155
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,000
quite commonly we hear about the

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,860
non-falsification or the

157
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,780
non-falcifability of the free energy

158
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,340
principle

159
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,400
as a principal akin to a principle of

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,720
least action

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,599
and one can see

162
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,339
that

163
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,820
comment addressed at the beginning of

164
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,740
this chapter which is sure whatever you

165
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,899
think about whether free energy

166
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,920
principle is tautological or it can it

167
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,480
can't be falsified

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
when we develop specific hypotheses

169
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,339
embodied as models of given systems of

170
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,640
Interest then we're certainly in the

171
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,100
space of being able to find unique

172
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,500
explanations and predictions to falsify

173
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,860
or not like we could have one model that

174
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,620
says that two brain regions are

175
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,140
connected in some way and then there

176
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,480
could be an experimental study that

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,680
falsifies or adds or removes evidence

178
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,740
to support that claim so this is where

179
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,380
we actually get into the last mile of

180
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,420
scientific modeling

181
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,880
where we're going to be saying specific

182
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,339
things about specific

183
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,180
systems

184
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,399
um

185
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
the Dual aim of this chapter is to

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,640
introduce readers with a technical

187
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,100
background to the neurobiology of active

188
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,860
inference so that's people coming from a

189
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,820
math

190
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,880
and modeling perspective to learn about

191
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,399
some of the importance neurobiological

192
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,720
substrates

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
where active inference models have been

194
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,420
constructed over the last 10 or so years

195
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,300
and to highlight to biologists the

196
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,860
relevance of theory to practical

197
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,480
neuroscience

198
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,580
so for those who are coming from more of

199
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,940
uh embodied or biological angle here

200
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,339
why does it matter that we're adding

201
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,760
this mathematical layer on top of the

202
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,480
raw anatomical observations like the

203
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,459
structural connectivity of different

204
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,959
brain regions

205
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
is an empirical measurement about the

206
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:28,620
world

207
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,019
so what are we doing that goes beyond

208
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,700
saying

209
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,880
this is connected to that

210
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,300
and the chapter is not the final word

211
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,339
it is simply some interpretations that

212
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,959
seem most consistent with the currently

213
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,399
available evidence

214
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,980
here they describe how in the following

215
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,180
sections

216
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,500
they're going to uh bring up first as

217
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,540
mentioned briefly before

218
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,240
the role of the micro circuit as a

219
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,459
computational component

220
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,500
which is very common to computational

221
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,880
neuroscience

222
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,620
then moving through motor and cortical

223
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,100
regions of the mammalian neuroscience

224
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,060
to understand first modularly and then

225
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,440
in composition how decisions around

226
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,459
motor behaviors can be seen as the

227
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,399
coordination among multiple active

228
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,980
inference generative models

229
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,620
anyone want to give a general thought or

230
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,440
just like something that's interesting

231
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
or exciting about

232
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,100
this framing

233
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,700
okay

234
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,300
section 5.2 micro circuits and messages

235
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,060
so in chapter four there was a

236
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,700
discussion about belief updating which

237
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,680
we spoke a little bit about in terms of

238
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,019
message passing and belief propagation

239
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,560
in Bayesian graphical Networks

240
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,800
and here they provide some written

241
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
overview

242
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,640
of the layered structure of the

243
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,820
mammalian cortex so does anyone want to

244
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,579
give a note on the mammalian cortex or

245
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,220
the layer structure the so-called

246
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,839
six-layer structure of the mammalian

247
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,380
cortex

248
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,720
so just for context this is like

249
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,459
um let's see where where it's actually

250
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,620
sliced through

251
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,220
here we have a prototypical mammalian

252
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,920
brain I'm always emphasizing mammalian

253
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,160
because this is not some general

254
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,500
um property of brains like invertebrate

255
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,180
brains have a very different layout they

256
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,680
don't have cortical layers in the same

257
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,300
way

258
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,200
um and so these cortical regions

259
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,959
near the top of the head

260
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,079
if one slices through them

261
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,459
they reveal a very specific pattern of

262
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,660
cells

263
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,899
that are arranged in these laminar or

264
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,000
layer like ways

265
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,519
and so there are these

266
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,139
um

267
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,760
six

268
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,160
areas

269
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,600
six layers one two three four five

270
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
um

271
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,680
maybe that should be six

272
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,180
um or maybe there's some other thing

273
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,040
happening here but this is representing

274
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,480
like a slice

275
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,000
through cortex

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,519
and so this has been modeled as a column

277
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,000
because as you go across

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,220
the cortical surface

279
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,620
there are these repeating units that

280
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,440
have this kind of laminar structure

281
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,980
it's like six layers of Locker

282
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,040
across the cortical surface

283
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,079
once it's unfolded and then sliced

284
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,339
through

285
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,860
and that's represented

286
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,600
from a

287
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,060
Bayesian computational

288
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,480
view in figure 5.1

289
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
canonical cortical microcircuits

290
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,959
illustrating relationship between

291
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,300
inferential message passing and the

292
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,099
architecture of the cerebral cortex

293
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,760
on the left

294
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,600
is a schematic of some Anatomy

295
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,579
where the different connections

296
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,019
represent

297
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,339
inhibitory or excitatory

298
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,300
synapses

299
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,240
so in high inhibitory synapses

300
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,600
reduce the likelihood of the downstream

301
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,480
neuron firing when activated and up and

302
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,519
excitatory synapses increase the

303
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,740
likelihood of the downstream neuron

304
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,800
firing when activated so the left is not

305
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,220
a base graph it's actually a summary of

306
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,720
structural

307
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,660
anatomical histological that means

308
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,800
tissue level Anatomy connectivity

309
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,199
in the middle

310
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,779
is a message passing architecture

311
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,500
so like a scheme for variables and their

312
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,600
connectivity within a hierarchical

313
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,540
predictive processing architecture

314
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,240
and on the right side is a message

315
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,300
passing scheme that's described to solve

316
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,040
a partially observable Markov decision

317
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,019
process pomdp

318
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,880
now on the left is an empirical

319
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,440
neuroanatomical

320
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,940
structural map

321
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,199
on the right we see two computational

322
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,260
implementations of inference and action

323
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,120
and they're being kind of laid out they

324
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,040
could be laid out in any way they could

325
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,500
look like um the Big Dipper

326
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
graphically

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
but they're being

328
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,120
juxtaposed with the cortical layers

329
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,279
so that we can start to see some

330
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,899
concordances

331
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,380
and resonances between the location of a

332
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,940
given variable

333
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,339
in a statistical model of inference and

334
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,220
action and the neurobiological

335
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,720
substrates

336
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,180
who with plausible biological

337
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,440
connectivity

338
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,740
might be implementing or doing something

339
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,040
like the computational role that the

340
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,740
variables play

341
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,500
in the abstract models

342
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,600
so that's going to be the path towards

343
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
or the template of the path towards

344
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,139
unique explanations and predictions

345
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,860
from using computational modeling of the

346
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,040
structural neural Anatomy

347
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
does anyone have any thoughts or

348
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,119
questions on

349
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,780
um figure five one or like

350
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,799
how a structural anatomical empirical

351
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,839
map

352
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,439
might be juxtaposed with

353
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,059
statistical models

354
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,700
um maybe a good thing to think about our

355
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,539
question answer here is like

356
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,419
what connections or what

357
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,080
um

358
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,880
structure

359
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,820
reflects something like a a belief in

360
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,280
the statistical sense

361
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,399
um

362
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,960
or what connection could be made there

363
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,699
so what

364
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,340
neurobiological structures can reflect

365
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,360
or represent beliefs

366
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
sure yeah

367
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,480
that's fair

368
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
when what way are they different or yeah

369
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,100
what what's not a belief here

370
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,740
does anyone have any a lot of arrows

371
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,380
thoughts yeah

372
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,000
and the quarterback

373
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,700
he's gonna sit here

374
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,919
yeah

375
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,960
one thing I notice immediately in this

376
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,520
uh previously is just the cortical

377
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,200
layers there and the there's this two on

378
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,700
the

379
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
right hand side of that for layer three

380
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,240
and layer four so I'm not sure what

381
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,200
exactly

382
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:08,340
yeah yes oh okay yep yep

383
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,740
um one important thing to note

384
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
about the cortical layers which is

385
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,200
almost

386
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,660
um

387
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,039
obtrusively under discussed

388
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,539
is the cortical column performs as one

389
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,520
integrated unit

390
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,440
the fact that it's six layers doesn't

391
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,059
mean that there's like a little octave

392
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,039
Loop and then a second active Loop and

393
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,900
then a third active Loop so it's not

394
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,179
like a six if someone said I'm looking

395
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,520
at a six layer predictive processing

396
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,140
hierarchy

397
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,539
one might think that there's like six

398
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,299
cleanly separated layers of a wedding

399
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,559
cake

400
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,660
but actually the cortical column has six

401
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,860
arbitrarily defined

402
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,720
not to say that there's no grounding but

403
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
there's finer scale differences and

404
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,500
there's coursing and there's overlapping

405
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,240
zones

406
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,640
and it's behaving with connections that

407
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,700
span across multiple layers

408
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,460
so this isn't like a clean six layer

409
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,100
predictive processing model

410
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,220
this is like one integrated architecture

411
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,059
that functions with this connectivity

412
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,740
and importantly this is the basis of

413
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,280
like the Thousand brains hypothesis and

414
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,520
numenta Ai and people who have been

415
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,240
pursuing the cortical architecture as

416
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,620
the or a basis for intelligence in

417
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,720
natural and artificial systems

418
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,960
and it's long been hypothesized when

419
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,760
comparing the brains of different

420
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,299
mammals like what neuroanatomical

421
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,179
features are associated with differences

422
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,820
in perceived intelligence or learning

423
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,020
capacity

424
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,260
and one of the features is the

425
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,520
prevalence in the primates and in humans

426
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,520
of higher cortical regions so-called

427
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,860
higher cortical regions with this

428
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,140
specific architecture

429
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,559
whereas other brain regions maybe have

430
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,340
not

431
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,120
had so much evolution in their

432
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,799
um size

433
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,039
or in their circuitry

434
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,679
that doesn't mean that they're

435
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,740
unimplicated in intelligence it just

436
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,960
means that people have looked for where

437
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,659
there are more differences

438
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:31,440
um

439
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,860
to this question that Brock asked about

440
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,380
like where might beliefs be

441
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,940
embodied

442
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,299
So within the Bayesian setting the

443
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,740
statistical setting

444
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,520
a belief is just any parameterization

445
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,260
can be said to be a belief about a

446
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,179
variable so we're not

447
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,120
talking about experienced or personally

448
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,000
held or verbally stateable beliefs we're

449
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,520
talking about statistical

450
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,679
parameterization of a given variable

451
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,260
and there's at least two ways one can

452
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,780
think about beliefs being represented or

453
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,360
embodied in a structure of this

454
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,640
and we're going through this in slow

455
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,280
time because like this kind of general

456
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,620
questions about what is the structural

457
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,100
neuroanatomy and how does it relate to

458
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,440
statistical modeling thereof

459
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,020
is going to be at the heart of the

460
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,179
following examples

461
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,940
as well not just this cortical

462
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,039
um case

463
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,220
um one can see the firing rate of a

464
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,179
neuron

465
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,919
in like an artificial neural network

466
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,120
setting or just the value that a

467
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,100
statistical variable takes on

468
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,740
as representing a belief about that

469
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,720
variable

470
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
then one can think about the presence or

471
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,559
absence or the waiting or the type like

472
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,020
inhibitory excitatory of a connection

473
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,299
between two variables

474
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,059
as embodying

475
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,780
a hypothesis about

476
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,659
the structure of how those variables are

477
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,200
connected

478
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,299
under the implicit assumption that we're

479
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,039
developing models that actually do

480
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
functional things

481
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
of course one could just connect all of

482
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,640
the variables and have an all by all

483
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,260
model

484
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,039
however as we sparsify the relationships

485
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
amongst variables which is to say remove

486
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,419
edges from the all by all

487
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,700
the model becomes computationally easier

488
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,380
to fit

489
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,860
and we talk about that in terms of the

490
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,419
factorizability

491
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,580
of the variational Bayesian approach

492
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,140
so if none of the variables were

493
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,419
connected they're all independently fit

494
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,000
that's like the simplest it can be

495
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,720
to fit n variables

496
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,480
if all the variables were interacting in

497
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,220
combinatoric ways

498
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,140
that would be increasingly

499
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,900
computationally complex and for a given

500
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,820
amount of data we would have less and

501
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,580
less statistical power to resolve any

502
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,440
given variable or combination of

503
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
variables because the same amount of

504
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
information from our observations

505
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,940
is now being like partitioned and spread

506
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,100
out over

507
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,200
fitting estimates for more and more

508
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
variables

509
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
and so

510
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,440
what biological systems do and what

511
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,299
statistical models do

512
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,600
is enforce either just through physical

513
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,120
constraints or through

514
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,740
design

515
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,320
sparsity conditions

516
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,280
on functional statistical modules

517
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,659
such that the models are more computable

518
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,940
though they only may be exploring a

519
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,220
subset of the space of total possible

520
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,100
models

521
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,659
exploring well

522
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,220
a subset

523
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,159
whose sparsity embodies certain aspects

524
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,659
of the world

525
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,200
maybe a more appropriate

526
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,000
um model to fit situationally

527
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,299
figure 5.2

528
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,980
simplified version of the predictive

529
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,840
coding scheme shown in the middle of

530
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,199
five one

531
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,600
so does anyone want to give a thought on

532
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
5-2

533
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,700
foreign

534
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,279
so here's message passing between three

535
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,840
cortical regions so here's three

536
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
cortical columns each consisting of like

537
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,059
one through six layers

538
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,500
and

539
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,600
um there's going to be message passing

540
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,158
happening laterally

541
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,720
dotted lines show ascending messages

542
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,240
prediction errors and solid lines show

543
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,580
descending messages or predictions

544
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,700
so in this setting

545
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,159
um this rightmost region

546
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,340
is like the quote top most but left

547
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,200
right top down bottom up those are all

548
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,299
just spatial metaphors

549
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,700
but we'll continue to use this higher

550
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,179
and lower in the hierarchical modeling

551
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,460
where the lower levels of the

552
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,900
hierarchical model

553
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,500
are more close to where the rubber hits

554
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,020
the road in terms of like the perceptual

555
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,960
machinery and the action effectors

556
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,140
and higher levels of a hierarchy are

557
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,299
associated with more and more abstract

558
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,960
or general or deeper or slower features

559
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,039
of the world

560
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,360
so

561
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,940
this figure

562
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,760
is representing how

563
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,120
um there is a uh

564
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,140
within cortical column relationship

565
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,900
between predictions

566
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
and prediction errors

567
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,340
between a superficial and the Deep

568
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,620
levels

569
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,860
using the concordance between variables

570
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,279
and cortical layers established in 5.1

571
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,260
and then

572
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,900
the um

573
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,919
outcome of one cortical layer

574
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,299
can also be engaged in this prediction

575
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,960
and prediction error relationship

576
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,520
with

577
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,600
an anatomically lateral cortical column

578
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,559
however from a computational perspective

579
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,659
this is like the top the middle and the

580
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,100
bottom

581
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,740
of a three layer cognitive model

582
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,760
the superscripts are describing the

583
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,840
level so here's like I I plus 1 and I

584
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,000
minus 1.

585
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,679
so this is just describing that this is

586
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,840
a scheme that can be

587
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,360
computationally extended to many levels

588
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,340
of hierarchical modeling

589
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,940
and it's being embodied by the lateral

590
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,640
juxtaposition

591
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,779
neuroanatomically of cortical columns

592
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,020
Ali did you have something you wanted to

593
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,379
add there

594
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,100
uh well yeah I I just wanted to

595
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,080
mention friston's uh recent paper from a

596
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,679
couple of months ago uh in which

597
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,400
uh the neurobiological substrate of uh

598
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,799
prediction errors are explained uh in in

599
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,900
detail namely the computational

600
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,500
Psychiatry which is a great

601
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,360
overview paper of

602
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,279
the whole field of computation

603
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
Psychiatry through the lens of active

604
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,760
inference and especially

605
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,179
in on the matter of

606
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,640
prediction error I'm sorry a matter of

607
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,039
prediction error I just wanted to uh

608
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,760
point the section uh let me

609
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,860
sorry yeah

610
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,799
You're The Importance of Being precise I

611
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,860
I just wanted to quote a couple of

612
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,799
sentences from this paper which says

613
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,200
and predicting or estimating uh

614
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,179
Precision is a universal requisite for

615
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,100
making sense of data from estimating the

616
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,440
signal to noise ratio in some sensory

617
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,320
apparatus through to estimating standard

618
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,080
error when making inference bison nyman

619
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,840
Pearson statistic affording certain

620
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,880
prediction errors greater Precision

621
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,700
increases their influence on belief

622
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,860
updating and has all the Hallmarks of

623
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,140
attentional selection physiologically

624
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,140
this simply entails an increase in the

625
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,600
excitability or post-synaptic gain of

626
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,539
neuronal populations broadcasting

627
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,159
prediction errors

628
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,260
on this view there is an intimate

629
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,600
relationship between attention and the

630
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,760
modulation of synaptic efficacy by

631
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,940
classical neuromodulators and non-linear

632
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,640
postsynaptic responses responsible for

633
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,220
mediating the exchange between fast

634
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,740
fighting spiking inhibitory interneurons

635
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,559
and superficial pyramidal cells so

636
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,080
it's basically the arguments from the

637
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,760
book but in a much more concise and a

638
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,399
little bit well-structured argument in

639
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:52,399
my opinion so if anyone wants to

640
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,980
um just look at this paper I think it

641
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,679
might be helpful in grasping uh the

642
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,399
material uh which is I'm posting the

643
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,460
link here in the chat

644
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,720
awesome

645
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,179
yeah thank you for sharing it just to

646
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:10,320
kind of

647
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,600
again as we walk towards unique

648
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,240
explanations and predictions for active

649
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,059
inference models of

650
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,240
empirical neural Anatomy we can think

651
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,419
about at least a few areas of alignment

652
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,460
between these models so there's

653
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,120
structural alignment where realized

654
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,520
anatomical connections

655
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,380
have

656
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,820
parallels

657
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,700
to statistical Connections in a Bayesian

658
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,080
graph

659
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,419
they are not one and the same but it's

660
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,520
just an area of alignment that can be

661
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,500
used to explore predictions and

662
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,059
explanations

663
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,279
then also there's two areas that are

664
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,919
mentioned by what Ali just read which

665
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,820
are some of the functional components

666
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,480
for example neural firing rates or

667
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,600
um synchronizations and other sorts of

668
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,120
dynamical

669
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,039
functional relationships

670
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,260
like when this variable is high that one

671
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,720
is lower whether they're connected or

672
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,240
not structurally

673
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,980
and chemical features like

674
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,360
neuromodulation or the presence or

675
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,020
absence of an excitatory or inhibitory

676
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,299
neuromodulator at a given synapse or

677
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,140
even

678
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,320
taking us into synaptic plasticity

679
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,679
and the neuromodulation of hebeian

680
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,899
associative learning

681
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,539
all of these areas

682
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,880
when brought together

683
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,059
in a total fabric of evidence

684
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,059
help us strengthen the relationship

685
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,100
between the computational models and the

686
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,039
neural anatomical empirical findings

687
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,899
and then they suggest things to each

688
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,080
other

689
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,419
so that was heavily on the cortical

690
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,880
architecture of the column

691
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,659
and then how laterally linked columns

692
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,240
which again is their empirical

693
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,539
structural connectivity patterns can be

694
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,539
thought of in terms of hierarchical

695
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,519
Bayesian modeling

696
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,240
then they move into motor commands

697
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,679
so

698
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,820
let's think about the layer V of the

699
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,080
cortex

700
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,720
projecting as a projection

701
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,279
so layer V of the column here is this DP

702
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,140
deep criminal cell that's just the name

703
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,220
of the cell it has a certain

704
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,539
architecture that makes it called

705
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,240
perimetable terminal

706
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,460
um this is like classic Santiago

707
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,740
romanica Hall stuff

708
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,679
and um it has this Arrow coming out

709
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,919
going to motor neurons so here's like a

710
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,360
motor output

711
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,700
from this cortical column

712
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,679
not all cortical columns are involved in

713
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,940
motor outputs but some are

714
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,339
so we're going to be receiving

715
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:13,500
inputs from those pyramidal neurons

716
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,219
and it's going to be projecting onto a

717
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,040
butterfly no this is a cross section of

718
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,260
the neural cord the spinal cord of a

719
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,619
mammal

720
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,719
figure five three

721
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,560
neuroanatomy associated with active

722
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,780
inference in modulating spinal motor

723
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,540
reflexes

724
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,239
coming in to the system from the proprio

725
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,918
sensors

726
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,918
afferent meaning like

727
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,219
um away from the sensor as opposed to

728
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,219
efferent

729
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,080
the proprioceptive afferent signal

730
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,160
is being compared in an error-like

731
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,760
fashion with an Epsilon

732
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,200
with

733
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,780
the descending taught down predictions

734
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,500
coming from that cortical column that we

735
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,020
just looked at

736
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,220
the output of this comparison is

737
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,640
a motor message or command or signal to

738
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,099
a motor actuator

739
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,320
so one can imagine that where

740
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,420
proprioception

741
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,680
exactly matches expectations around

742
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,660
proprioception

743
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,220
no

744
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,880
motor movement might be passed forward

745
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,940
I'm trying to hold my hand on the table

746
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,000
all signals are suggesting that the

747
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,460
expectation is being realized

748
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,180
and no movement is enacted

749
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,240
in comparison if one expects

750
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,119
to be receiving different proprioceptive

751
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,359
afferent information which is to say to

752
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,960
be in a different postural position

753
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,760
then motor commands can be enacted to

754
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,720
reduce that Divergence

755
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,940
so different proprio receptors for

756
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,800
example are in your elbow

757
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,880
such that there's a different

758
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,980
proprioceptive afferent coming in when

759
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,780
your elbow is extended

760
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,960
and when it's completely closed

761
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
and then

762
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,099
expectations

763
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,920
in the head

764
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,780
the brain

765
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,640
can change

766
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,859
such that different motor commands are

767
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:41,760
enacted to open and or close the elbow

768
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,859
dynamically

769
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,359
as

770
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,099
authentic proprioceptive information

771
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,940
comes in

772
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,440
so broadly that is this neural Anatomy

773
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,579
any thoughts or questions on it

774
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,780
uh actually there's

775
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,540
um I think it was in the beginning of

776
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,579
section

777
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:24,300
5.3 uh there's a sentence which might uh

778
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,880
result in some uh misunderstanding your

779
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,220
confusions which says the schematic on

780
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,740
the left in figure 5.1 shows that layer

781
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,660
5 of the cortex projects with spinal

782
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,060
pyramidal neurons and that this can be

783
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,060
interpreted as a prediction but if we

784
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,180
look at figure 5.2 I'm sorry 5.1

785
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,339
we we won't see

786
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,200
um

787
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,820
this explicitly

788
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,660
um I mean anything labeled as a spinal

789
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,680
pyramidal neurons because uh

790
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,200
because the primary citation neural cell

791
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,599
types in corticospinal tract is

792
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,180
pyramidal Neuron spinal motor neurons

793
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,220
and spinal parameter neurons are

794
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,640
sometimes used interchangeably so in

795
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,800
this figure actually what we see is an

796
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,380
excited worry connection which is drawn

797
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,800
from layer 5 to spinal motor neurons and

798
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,260
not spinal pyramidal neurons but they're

799
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,740
basically the same things so I just

800
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,400
wanted to clear up that uh

801
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,640
if anyone has that misunderstanding

802
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,040
thank you the pyramidal neuron

803
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,820
there's a large diversity of structure

804
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,680
but

805
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,420
if you like squiggles that look like

806
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,440
this

807
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,180
you'll love cellular neuroscience

808
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,119
all right

809
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,320
um there's an extremely interesting

810
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,160
discussion around sensory attenuation

811
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,119
in the context of motor initiation and

812
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,380
completion

813
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,420
so

814
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,240
we need a way when we want to make a

815
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,640
move so to speak we need a way to

816
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,619
preclude sensory data from updating our

817
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,260
expectations so that we can entertain

818
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,480
the initially false belief that we are

819
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,880
moving so this belief can be realized

820
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,320
through action

821
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,500
so let's just imagine that we're in a

822
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,380
case where we are expecting the elbow to

823
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,900
be closed but the proprioceptive

824
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,880
information is suggesting that it's

825
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,099
extended

826
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,900
if

827
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,980
um you know

828
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,800
the cortical hierarchy simply changes

829
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,420
its belief

830
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,800
to it I believe that it is closed

831
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,160
that will immediately be overwritten by

832
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,020
the vertical proprioceptive information

833
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,300
coming in

834
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,820
and so as we know there's two ways to

835
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,460
update the generative model and to

836
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,200
minimize free energy changing the world

837
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,720
and changing your mind so here it's like

838
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,000
change the body or change the mind

839
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,780
and under high Precision information

840
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,420
coming in

841
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,000
changing one's Minds will be brought

842
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,640
back into alignment with the high

843
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,560
attention which is to say high Precision

844
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,720
to the sensory information coming back

845
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,859
in

846
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,859
and so the computational strategy

847
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,720
implemented

848
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,280
is

849
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,680
that the descending motor tracks predict

850
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,720
not just the data but the Precision or

851
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,820
the confidence placed in those data so

852
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,700
high Precision high confidence High

853
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,980
attention that means you snap to

854
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,380
whatever that is being

855
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,720
uh whatever that high attention high

856
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,400
confidence High attention variable is

857
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,780
saying

858
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,880
in the extreme just whatever it said in

859
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,200
the last time Point becomes your

860
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,060
estimate

861
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,820
the opposite extreme is low confidence

862
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,900
low Precision low attention

863
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,240
and in that case no matter what that

864
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,520
signal says you don't change your mind

865
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,500
at all

866
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,440
and so what happens is

867
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,000
previously we're talking about the

868
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,800
elbows prediction around being like open

869
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,200
or closed but now let's think about it

870
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,839
as providing a

871
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,520
um

872
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,520
uh expectation and a variance

873
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,240
coming down

874
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,660
um so initially the confidence placed in

875
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,560
those data are decreased

876
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,740
that allows movement to be initiated

877
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,900
this is known as sensory attenuation and

878
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,520
can be thought of as the complement to

879
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,339
sensory attention so attenuation just is

880
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,780
low attention

881
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,660
diminishing increasing of attention

882
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,760
equipping us with the capacity to ignore

883
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,200
certain prediction errors such as

884
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,119
generated by psychatic eye movements

885
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,579
where sensory attenuation is known as

886
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,680
psychotic suppression

887
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,640
so other than the blind spot and so on

888
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,540
cycatic suppression is one of the most

889
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,119
interesting examples of kind of embodied

890
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,220
Precision modulation

891
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,619
like when you do an isocade which can

892
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,720
happen multiple times per seconds

893
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,020
there's no nausea or vertigo except when

894
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,760
it's pathological

895
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,980
because

896
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,079
during that motor movement

897
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,140
there's a reduced attention to the

898
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,000
bottom-up visual input and this is

899
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
highly highly empirically demonstrated

900
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,400
in multiple areas of the visual

901
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,220
processing neurobiology

902
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,660
so that like when the eye is still

903
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,720
there's an increased attention to the

904
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,079
incoming raw bottom-up information

905
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:57,660
when the eye is moving there's a

906
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,119
decreased attention to the bottom-up

907
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,579
information and an increased Reliance on

908
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,680
the generative model during those

909
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,740
transients of cicada

910
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,940
and so similarly to initiate a movement

911
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,300
requires an initial suppression of

912
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,819
precision

913
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:19,140
alongside a change in expected

914
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,260
expectation of proprioception

915
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,359
and that's what allows one to believe

916
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,619
like okay I'm going to get out of the

917
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,180
chair

918
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,980
I believe that I'm out of the chair and

919
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,900
then that shifts the balance of

920
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,540
minimizing free energy towards changing

921
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,940
your body AKA changing the world through

922
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,900
action

923
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,940
rather than immediately just getting

924
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,940
your change your mind

925
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,280
knocked back into place

926
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,099
and interestingly this is absolutely

927
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,540
Concordance

928
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,440
with many healthy neurodiversity and

929
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,839
pathological scenarios

930
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,819
involving

931
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:00,720
um the neurobiology of failure to

932
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,779
initiate continue or terminate movement

933
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,839
so like there's scenarios where somebody

934
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,480
may have trouble beginning movements but

935
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,220
once they've begun movement they can

936
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,880
walk normally

937
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,819
alternatively there are motor

938
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:25,740
behaviors where somebody may have

939
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,579
trouble terminating Behavior

940
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,440
and so these can be modeled from a

941
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,839
computational perspective so that not

942
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,520
only are we able to say well this

943
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,500
chemical is higher in this condition or

944
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,420
people with this diagnosis tend to have

945
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,859
this comorbidity

946
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,319
but we can actually think about the

947
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,540
parameterization of these computational

948
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,980
models

949
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,680
and have some more Nuance around well

950
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
should we be increasing what or

951
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,319
modulating what Ollie

952
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:01,619
actually there's an interesting argument

953
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,680
in Mark's home's uh book The Hidden

954
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,460
Spring which says that

955
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,140
because

956
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,480
Consciousness I mean it says that

957
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,000
Consciousness is only required to

958
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,460
mediate mismatches between internal and

959
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,160
external States the more adaptively and

960
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,839
predictively reliable our model becomes

961
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,680
the more our Behavior becomes automated

962
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,020
operating below the level of conscious

963
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,200
experience so basically it says that

964
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,660
Consciousness is needed in situations

965
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,720
where surprisal needs to be minimized

966
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,880
when there's no surprisal there's not

967
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,099
much need for Consciousness or in other

968
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:44,839
words

969
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,980
Consciousness is a process that somehow

970
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,260
seeks to overcome itself

971
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,099
um

972
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:58,579
well very deep

973
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:03,020
thank you for sharing it

974
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,400
okay

975
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,599
just to peer ahead into where we're

976
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,000
going in the second half of five and

977
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,040
then people can think about some

978
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,520
questions hopefully write them down as

979
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,940
they see fit so now we're coming back

980
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,420
into the brain into the subcortical

981
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,040
structures

982
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,579
so beneath the layer of Cortex

983
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:33,180
that has the histology described by the

984
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,640
columnar architecture are the

985
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,980
subcortical structures sometimes

986
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,400
referred to as being in the midbrain

987
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
specifically there's going to be a

988
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,680
discussion of the basal ganglia

989
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,720
and colleagues

990
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,540
this is one of the regions in the brain

991
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,420
that has been implicated through many

992
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,599
neuroimaging and disease related and all

993
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,480
kinds of different studies

994
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,839
in decision making and learning and it's

995
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,000
known to have some dopaminergic

996
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,099
characteristics

997
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,140
expression of signaling related to

998
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,720
dopamine and actually only a very small

999
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,060
fraction of cells in the in the

1000
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,880
mammalian or invertebrate neuroanatomy

1001
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,880
are dopaminergic in this way

1002
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,680
it's not like every neuron is responsive

1003
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,260
to to dopamine

1004
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,920
um

1005
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,119
some of the details are described

1006
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,819
some of the mathematical parallels are

1007
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,339
drawn and here

1008
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,240
it culminates in

1009
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,140
a uh indirect pathway and direct pathway

1010
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,098
of decision making

1011
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,560
that are Which choice between these two

1012
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,599
Pathways is favored

1013
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,060
is going to be computationally assigned

1014
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,300
to the role of this gamma variable

1015
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,240
and these two pathways

1016
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,459
can be thought of as sort of like

1017
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,859
deliberative decision making

1018
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,960
in the direct pathway

1019
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,440
and instinctual or habitual decision

1020
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,740
making in the indirect pathway

1021
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,380
how do we see that playing out

1022
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,960
observations are coming in

1023
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,740
and in both cases policy pie are coming

1024
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,240
out

1025
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,760
so this neuroanatomy

1026
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,880
is implementing a computation that takes

1027
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,920
in some type of input from the cerebral

1028
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,660
cortex which again might be a prediction

1029
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,900
about something else and results in

1030
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,800
policy evaluation and selection

1031
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,260
e is the variable representing

1032
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,420
affordances and it can be thought of as

1033
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,819
like a habit Vector because it

1034
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,619
characterizes not just what can be done

1035
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,140
but the Baseline frequencies or

1036
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,420
probabilities of those actions to be

1037
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,260
done

1038
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,859
whereas G is expected free energy and

1039
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,099
that relies not on the past

1040
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,619
habits and ratios of performance of

1041
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,119
different behaviors

1042
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,220
without consideration to the impact of

1043
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,720
those behaviors but rather the expected

1044
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,540
free energy calculations around

1045
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,099
different policies that could be

1046
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,619
undertaken

1047
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,079
so here we can start to see differences

1048
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:26,940
in decision making

1049
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,240
where sometimes this is sort of a type 1

1050
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,500
type 2

1051
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,740
manifolds in terms of like quick simple

1052
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,440
decisions that don't even need to

1053
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,880
reference the future

1054
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,760
on the indirect pathway and

1055
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,640
deliberative potentially planning like

1056
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,460
operations involving expected free

1057
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,200
energy calculations and a dopaminergic

1058
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,280
neuromodulatory feature

1059
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,280
that balances the relative contributions

1060
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,160
of these two decision-making Pathways

1061
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,319
with respect to their influence on

1062
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,859
policy

1063
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,060
table 5.1

1064
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,020
describes neurotransmitters

1065
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,720
they're Associated computational role

1066
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,540
even though they all play many roles

1067
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,599
this is just a coarse draining and a

1068
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,240
sort of starting point

1069
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,720
and then empirical evidence

1070
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,380
around the role of that neurotransmitter

1071
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,200
in that computational way

1072
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,859
many work by first and at all many work

1073
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:42,200
just in the normal Neuroscience route

1074
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,640
5.6

1075
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,640
is going to move us towards it's a short

1076
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,800
section

1077
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,400
um

1078
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,619
moving us towards

1079
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,960
thinking about stitching and composing

1080
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,099
together

1081
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,800
hierarchical active inference generative

1082
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,339
models that have continuous and discrete

1083
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,260
State spaces together

1084
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,960
because as they write

1085
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,240
our interface in the world around us in

1086
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,920
the Contin is in the continuous domain

1087
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,540
the implication of which is at the

1088
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,160
lowest level of any hierarchy in the

1089
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,079
brain must be continuous

1090
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,780
however as decision making becomes more

1091
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,460
and more abstracted

1092
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,920
it can be seen increasingly in certain

1093
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,819
cases as symbolic or discrete

1094
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,500
so from the perspective of a generative

1095
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,960
model that means associating alternative

1096
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,260
discrete hypotheses about the world

1097
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,300
with continuous Dynamics entailed by

1098
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,540
those hypotheses turn left or turn right

1099
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,220
bring an umbrella don't bring an

1100
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,220
umbrella is it raining or not friend or

1101
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,759
enemy

1102
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:52,319
juxtaposed with the continuous

1103
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,160
information arising from the body

1104
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,260
and in summary

1105
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,599
with a short section again

1106
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,579
they are now going to link together the

1107
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:04,619
three neuroanatomical systems that are

1108
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:06,420
described in the chapter

1109
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,059
under the spirit of this type of

1110
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,920
continuous discrete hybrid generative

1111
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,359
modeling approach

1112
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:15,480
specifically we see this cortical

1113
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,940
hierarchy

1114
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,980
that is engaged in a relationship

1115
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,040
in with a subcortical structures

1116
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,900
a biologically plausible relationship

1117
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,420
which reflects the actual structural

1118
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,339
anatomical connectivity between cortical

1119
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,079
and subcortical structures

1120
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,240
and of appropriate computational

1121
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,240
parallelisms

1122
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,800
#explanations and predictions

1123
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,980
and in the brain

1124
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,660
the cortical and subcortical

1125
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,819
architectures

1126
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,720
are ultimately resulting in this study

1127
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,599
with outputs that then engage the spinal

1128
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,940
column in the reflex arc that was

1129
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,800
described earlier

1130
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,500
so policies might be discrete throw the

1131
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,720
baseball or don't

1132
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,099
and that can be using complex cortical

1133
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:10,740
predictive processing like decision

1134
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,979
making

1135
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,800
facilitated by this dopaminergically

1136
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,960
mediated handoff between more

1137
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,079
instinctual habitual like behavior and

1138
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,760
more deliberative like expected free

1139
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,859
energy comparisons

1140
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:29,339
and that can be enacted

1141
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,660
through

1142
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,200
a prediction minimizing approach

1143
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,740
carried out in the spinal column

1144
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,740
this is continuous whereas policies can

1145
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,520
be discretized

1146
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:50,280
that's a short chapter there's no

1147
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,780
equations there's some variables in the

1148
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,740
figures but there aren't really

1149
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,339
equations

1150
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,079
this

1151
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,460
chapter

1152
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,440
over the years will be fractally

1153
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,480
unpacked

1154
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,319
to the most incredible level of detail

1155
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:11,339
they are just raising some key points

1156
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:15,780
and pointing some initial steps Ollie

1157
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,960
foreign

1158
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,559
as I uh mentioned in the previous cohort

1159
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,819
I just wanted to recommend this talk uh

1160
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:29,700
from Thomas Parr which summarizes most

1161
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,480
of the points in this chapter and some

1162
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,599
more uh and uh I highly highly recommend

1163
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,859
it for anyone uh reading this chapter

1164
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:43,920
because it really helps understanding

1165
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,119
some of the more obscure Concepts here

1166
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,700
thank you excellent okay any final

1167
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,740
thoughts or we will close this session

1168
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,460
okay

1169
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,599
thank you cohort too
