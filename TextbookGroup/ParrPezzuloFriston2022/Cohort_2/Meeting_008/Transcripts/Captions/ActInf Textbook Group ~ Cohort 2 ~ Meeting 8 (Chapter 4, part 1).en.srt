1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,280
greetings everyone

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,199
it is uh October 21st 2022.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,320
we're in textbook group number 50.1 no I

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,780
just have a slight typo

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,699
in my OBS it's cohort 2 and meeting

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,440
eight

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,560
we're discussing chapter four in our

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,060
first discussion of chapter four

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,900
we're going to

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,500
as we did not have any chapter or for

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,200
specific questions from cohort two today

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,660
largely we're going to be reviewing and

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,980
revising

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,140
questions that were initially addressed

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,480
in cohort one

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,059
taking a second pass and seeing where we

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,200
can like add some context and simple or

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,620
complex or however questions that we can

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,579
add so you can be adding in the chat

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,199
or in the questions tables directly or

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,719
like just unmuting and um

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,580
addressing them

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,860
so that we can have high quality and

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,060
quantity

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,299
of a large diversity of questions on the

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,320
material

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,420
that people are curious about when

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,740
they're reviewing the text

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,659
before we go to the questions table does

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,659
anyone have any general thoughts or

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,040
comments on chapter four

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,200
yes please Ollie

33
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,579
as we discussed in the previous cohort

34
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,560
this chapter is probably the most

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
technical one

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
in the whole book so

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
uh as people go through the formalism

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,619
here in this chapter uh I think it's

39
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,420
quite normal to not fully understand

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,020
every single equation there so uh in

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,560
case uh there are some difficulties in

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,760
getting uh in getting the content of

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,879
this chapter I think some of these

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
difficulties not all of them would be

45
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,980
unpacked in the later chapters

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,739
thank you very much totally agreed

47
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,300
anyone else want to make a general

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,739
chapter 4 comment

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,980
yeah there's such an interesting

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,959
rhythm

51
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,760
chapter one

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,060
being largely contextualizing and

53
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,379
framing

54
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,560
the chapter 2 3 dialectic

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,900
the low road and the high road

56
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,480
chapter four with a focus on the

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,980
generative model

58
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,459
and it is a very technical chapter

59
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,160
five

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,800
whiplashing over to neurobiology

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,260
and less on the fundamental formalisms

62
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,540
more on the neuroviological

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,580
relationships

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,220
that constitutes the epistemic first

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,440
half of the book

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,260
the second half of the book has kind of

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,540
a rhyming pattern

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,760
but less focused on epistemic and more

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,000
on pragmatic although the pragma of

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,140
epistem

71
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,599
whereas chapter 6

72
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,659
is focusing more on the recipe

73
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,239
for making the model and less of the

74
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,780
contextualizing then there's another

75
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,180
chapter pair

76
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,340
seven and eight discrete and continuous

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,420
time

78
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,980
and then chapter nine which is where

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,180
we're heading into in just um 50 minutes

80
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,760
in the first cohort with model based

81
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,220
data analysis and then chapter 10 as

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,400
sort of like the symmetry of chapter one

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,720
and the three appendices

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,519
okay

85
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
if anyone has comments of course just

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,299
like raise your hand

87
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,639
or speak up or put it in the chat or

88
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,000
however

89
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,500
all

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,840
on upvote these so we can upload them

91
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,340
when we've gone through them today

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,919
okay

93
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,340
well

94
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,199
let's scroll through the chapter before

95
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,880
we go to the questions just to get a

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,360
view of it

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,639
this chapter complements the preceding

98
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,380
chapters conceptual treatment of active

99
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,240
with a more formal treatment

100
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
it sets out the relationship between

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,139
free energy Bayesian inference form of

102
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,759
generative models and the Dynamics

103
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,520
obtained from minimizing free energy the

104
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,560
key focus is on how time is represented

105
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,000
4.2 Bayesian inference to free energy

106
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,940
equation four one recalls Bayes theorem

107
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,800
figure four one describes Jensen

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
inequality

109
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,860
which is related to the tonicity of the

110
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,840
natural log or just the logarithm

111
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,960
function in general

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,199
and it's uh pretty fundamental

113
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,580
point

114
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,620
and it speaks to the advantage of using

115
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,919
for example log probabilities

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,740
and the different kinds of operations

117
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,100
that are possible on logged values

118
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,800
here is an application of Jensen's

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,380
inequality

120
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,180
to derive a free energy value

121
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,580
as a bounded

122
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,960
um

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,859
is it bounding

124
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,500
foreign

125
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,860
ments amongst Bayes theorem and free

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,100
energy

127
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,319
generative models

128
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,940
to calculate the free energy we need

129
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,400
three things data a family of

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,900
variational distributions and a

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,699
generative Model comprising A prior and

132
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,240
likelihood

133
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,340
the section has two types of generative

134
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,180
model

135
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,100
the first is dealing with categorical

136
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,319
variables the second deals with

137
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,340
continuous variables

138
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,479
bigger 4.2

139
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,020
is helping gain some familiarity

140
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,660
with like nodes and edges

141
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,240
in a Bayesian graph

142
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,080
so here in a base graph

143
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,500
nodes are variables circular nodes are

144
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,639
variables

145
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,160
and edges which are like labeled with

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,900
the with a box

147
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,199
reflect their relationships

148
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
so

149
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
one can imagine and we'll return to this

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,479
in the questions

151
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
these map onto situations where like

152
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,940
there's a hidden cause and an

153
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,740
observation you know temperature in the

154
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,759
room

155
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,220
thermometer reading

156
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,919
two things that influence one outcome

157
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,080
one hidden thing that influences two

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,120
outcomes

159
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,580
a hierarchical model where something

160
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,860
changes something that results in an

161
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,680
outcome and so on

162
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,340
and then the boxes are labeled according

163
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,340
to the way that we might see that in a

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,300
more

165
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,319
uh

166
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,880
formulaic conditional likelihood

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,440
expression

168
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,440
vertical line means conditional upon

169
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
so like

170
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,639
box too is the probability distribution

171
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,160
of Y conditioned upon X

172
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,419
because of the directedness of this

173
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,840
error

174
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,200
figure 4 3 is a very central figure in

175
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,820
the textbook

176
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,179
and it

177
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,659
sets up the similarities and differences

178
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,820
largely

179
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,040
between the discrete time and the

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,620
continuous time formulations of active

181
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,320
inference generative models in terms of

182
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,300
partially observable Markov decision

183
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
processes through discrete time

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,100
and for the um more uh Taylor series

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,800
expansion-like approach used for

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,180
continuous time

187
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,740
does anyone want to like give a thought

188
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,779
or an overview on what is happening in

189
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,500
figure four three

190
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,120
yes Ali and then anyone else

191
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,940
well the top figure is

192
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,980
um what happens when we

193
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,320
uh uh when we want to model uh discrete

194
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,800
time uh discrete Time Event and the

195
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,820
bottom one is more

196
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,459
conducive to modeling The Continuous

197
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,140
time phenomena so as we see you see

198
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,500
they're quite parallel and

199
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,560
the only difference or at least the most

200
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
important difference here is the role

201
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,399
that policies play in the discrete time

202
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,580
case and the V play and the continuous

203
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,620
time case and the policy is denoted with

204
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,580
the pi and the top figure and it relates

205
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,600
to the top figure relates to the Palm DP

206
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,459
approach to modeling the discrete time

207
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,540
phenomena as we'll see at length in

208
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,240
chapter seven and the bottom one is

209
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,300
unpacked in more I mean in chapter 8 I

210
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,459
guess

211
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,180
excellent

212
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,940
again anyone can uh raise their hand and

213
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,040
go for it but just to kind of

214
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,959
describe what the nodes and edges are

215
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,300
here we'll be thinking about like the

216
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,920
temperature in the room is the hidden

217
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
State and the thermometer is the

218
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
observation

219
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,820
so in the discrete time formulation this

220
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,220
is the temperature in the room

221
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,740
through time it's the hidden State it's

222
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,959
in the generative process

223
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,899
then there's an a matrix

224
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,360
here labeled as 2 which is the

225
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,339
distribution of observations on the

226
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,740
thermometer conditioned upon the

227
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,660
temperature at that time

228
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,120
so the a matrix can be used as a

229
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,760
recognition density to do inference on

230
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,700
the hidden State given the observation

231
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,140
or it can be used in a generative

232
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,339
capacity

233
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,459
given a temperature to emit

234
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,140
distributions of thermometer

235
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,360
observations

236
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,079
the 3 corresponds to the B Matrix

237
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,240
which is the distribution of the state

238
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,640
at the next time conditioned upon the

239
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,860
state at the given time and the policy

240
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,000
pie

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,920
so 3 or B

242
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,260
escribes how the temperature is changing

243
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,279
Through Time

244
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,339
so this kind of through line of hidden

245
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,860
State and then a b Matrix or three and

246
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,240
then a hidden State this is something

247
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,360
changing through time and then Pi is

248
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,680
policy which is uh a function of the

249
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,899
decision making of the entity

250
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,060
and it influences how States change

251
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,700
their time that's the discrete time

252
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,240
formulation time Point negative one zero

253
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,920
and one

254
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,040
or however and

255
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,700
often you see a d or a prior which is uh

256
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,180
how the first hidden State value gets

257
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,100
initialized

258
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,800
that's the discrete time formulation

259
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,420
in the continuous time formulation

260
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,579
they're being laid out side by side

261
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,360
because the isomorphy of the models

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,500
is apparent they have the same

263
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,660
topological structure

264
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,760
however there are some really important

265
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,260
differences

266
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,300
rather than describing

267
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,880
how a hidden State changes through time

268
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,639
at explicitly demarcated time points

269
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,860
like

270
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,180
minute 12 minute 13 minute 14.

271
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,040
um what's Happening Here

272
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
is that

273
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,500
the the value of the Hidden State at the

274
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,620
focal time is still in an a matrix

275
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,040
relationship with observables so the

276
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,380
probability of Y given X

277
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,820
is exactly analogous to this one

278
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,740
of the observations conditioned on the

279
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,220
hidden state

280
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,980
however taking the place of the B Matrix

281
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,899
three above here which describes how

282
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,760
hidden States change their time in the

283
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
discrete time formulation

284
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
is actually a edge that describes the

285
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,180
derivative of x

286
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,600
conditioned upon X and V

287
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,180
which relates to slowly changing causes

288
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,120
in the world analogous to policy

289
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,339
and so this is actually not doing

290
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,860
explicit prediction of future explicit

291
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,540
time points

292
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,940
but rather it's doing something like a

293
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,980
Taylor series expansion

294
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,899
where as you take more and more

295
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,600
derivatives further and further away

296
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
from a focal point

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,300
you gain better and better approximation

298
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,760
through Power series expansion

299
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,560
from a focal point

300
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,479
using higher and higher derivatives

301
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,620
so here's like an example

302
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,880
here's a sine wave

303
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,699
and the first derivative

304
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,160
just gives you this locally linearizable

305
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,899
range

306
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,420
but there's a well-defined computational

307
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,820
complexity for a Taylor series

308
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,040
you can say the zeroth order is just

309
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,860
zero in the first order just a linear

310
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,120
regression

311
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,240
and then there's just a quadratic and

312
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,459
then there's just a third power

313
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,399
relationship and so on and so as you get

314
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,660
more and more

315
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,699
getting into the blue and the purple and

316
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,839
so on

317
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,540
you get better and better fit and you

318
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,240
extend the range of fit further and

319
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,740
further out

320
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,660
and it always gets strictly better

321
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
this is going to come back in chapter

322
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,420
seven and eight which are going to focus

323
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,160
more directly on the discrete and

324
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,620
continuous time formulations

325
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,800
but for here and four

326
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
they're just being introduced as

327
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,399
different ways that we can have a

328
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,480
generative model in active

329
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,000
so now figure four or section four four

330
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,279
is gonna

331
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,420
come to the top of four three

332
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,380
there's some formalisms related to

333
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,019
categorical distributions that are

334
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,000
compatible with partially observable

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Markov decision processes

336
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,620
here's an expected free energy G

337
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,120
that describes some different

338
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,880
partitionings

339
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,660
on as a function of policies

340
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,300
evaluating policies based upon their

341
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,800
impact on the pomdp

342
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,040
four key ingredients for the discrete

343
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
time generative model

344
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,160
a b c d

345
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
then moving to continuous time

346
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,820
but first there is a kind of a technical

347
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,320
interlude

348
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,199
on Markov blankets previously there was

349
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,120
a box defining the markout blanket and

350
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,800
here it's discussed in the context of

351
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,020
message passing yes GSF anywhere if you

352
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,959
want to call attention to

353
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,540
yeah

354
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,720
[Music]

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,439
um I was going back to the figure four

356
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,540
three

357
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,599
so in looking at the at the parallel

358
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,299
between the top and the bottom figure so

359
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,980
in the in the top figure Pi that is the

360
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,480
policy

361
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,780
is obviously something that is selected

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,799
by the agent right

363
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,660
what about new in the like I mean

364
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,740
the the Greek letter that that is uh

365
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,179
that is paralleled to Pi in the bottom

366
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,100
figure

367
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,780
uh new is it um because he said slowly

368
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,059
slowly varying causes in in the

369
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,460
environment or something like that but

370
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,059
is that something emitted or selected by

371
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,460
the agent or is it something because

372
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,740
yeah

373
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,380
does anyone have a thought on this the

374
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,660
distinction is just between discrete and

375
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,880
continuous is not between like something

376
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,660
that that it's a autonomous autonomously

377
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,760
selected by the agent or something that

378
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,799
is you know happening in the environment

379
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,340
right

380
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,620
huh Ali

381
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,220
uh actually in continuous

382
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,880
um in continuous time situation uh the

383
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,360
new here can also be

384
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
um

385
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,700
related to uh the non-cognitive aspects

386
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,919
of the system such as the attractors of

387
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,059
the system so that's why it's described

388
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,320
in terms of the slowly varying causes

389
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,860
for instance in chapter 8 we will see

390
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,240
that uh well we have some static

391
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,480
variables According to which the system

392
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,360
behaves so that's not exactly something

393
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,340
that the system will choose per se

394
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,500
it's some some

395
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,320
some variables or some states towards

396
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,100
which the system that will approach so

397
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,280
that's yeah that's why uh they've termed

398
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,760
it in battery so for instance when

399
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,280
applying to to movements

400
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,940
that can be some sort of

401
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,500
um

402
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,080
anatomical constraint of the movement

403
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,700
something like that

404
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,660
exactly yeah I see okay thank you

405
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,640
yeah

406
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,160
thank you for um

407
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,080
sharing that Ali

408
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,360
it reminds me of the question

409
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,340
that

410
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,740
came later

411
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
action is part of in this is chapter

412
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,280
eight action is part of the generative

413
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,940
process not the generative model

414
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,260
and so the actual

415
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,940
um

416
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,480
interpretation of slowly varying causes

417
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,179
and the mapping of slowly varying causes

418
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,660
to real world phenomena

419
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,580
is

420
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,960
one

421
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,460
interesting

422
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,799
area

423
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,740
another

424
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,860
General point

425
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,140
is that uh if we look to the figures

426
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,539
we'll see that the first figure

427
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,059
is the action perception

428
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,820
Loop

429
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,559
and initially

430
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,700
there's some usage of the base graph

431
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,240
in terms of elaboration on the action

432
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,200
perception Loop

433
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,500
and so on

434
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,780
but when we get to chapter four and the

435
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,059
generative model

436
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,600
we don't see the action perception Loop

437
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,200
represented the same way

438
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,260
and so it's an interesting question to

439
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,419
ask

440
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,600
where these variables

441
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,000
map onto for example The Entity model

442
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,039
this isn't simply an entity model

443
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,299
okay so it's completing our our quick

444
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,240
scan before we go to the questions

445
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,940
message passing and Mark all blankets

446
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,720
this is definitely an area that we could

447
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,980
um

448
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,659
learn a lot more

449
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,520
about

450
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,340
and this is also an area where software

451
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,140
packages exist

452
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,600
with the work of the bias lab

453
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,419
and therefore knee

454
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,140
package

455
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,919
okay

456
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,600
figure four four Bayesian message

457
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
passing

458
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,100
does anyone want to describe this figure

459
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,240
Just one thought well the overall

460
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,220
thought is is this supposed to be

461
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,799
something that we're supposed to in

462
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,059
detail

463
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,980
understand

464
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,059
or is it more like an illustrative

465
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,020
representation

466
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,500
I was thinking exactly the same when I

467
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,559
saw it it's like here's the kind of food

468
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,679
you could make or is this like here's

469
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
how you make this one dish

470
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,879
um there are uh

471
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,659
also it's not red from left to right per

472
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,980
se

473
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,440
at the level of the figure the caption

474
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,360
begins with a right

475
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
so starting with the left the scheme

476
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,340
could be expanded hierarchically

477
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,200
collapsing over time steps and policies

478
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,419
for Simplicity so just looking at the

479
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,380
left one

480
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,440
here the subscripts have I

481
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,260
on the bottom then the subscripts have I

482
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,640
plus one

483
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,940
but you see the same squiggle Pi s

484
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,380
Epsilon

485
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,159
so this is showing that within the

486
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,860
context of a hierarchical model

487
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,760
you can have recurring patterns

488
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,240
of topological relationships of a base

489
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,200
graph

490
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
to enable for example hierarchical

491
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,100
predictive processing active

492
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,820
Bayesian action selection Etc models

493
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,940
and then that is collapsed over time

494
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,640
steps and policies

495
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,380
so what's happening here

496
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,419
so this is going to be unpacking within

497
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,740
one layer

498
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,720
on the right side

499
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,559
and we see like so here there's no

500
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,419
superscript but we can just take that to

501
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,720
be like Pi I so this is going to be this

502
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,820
quartet

503
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,780
being expanded out so here's o tilde

504
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,539
like o Through Time coming in

505
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,080
and here's like the actual discrete time

506
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,699
observations coming in

507
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,260
here's Epsilon

508
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,539
and S

509
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,760
in a um

510
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,120
uh predictive processing capacity

511
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,000
and these are illustrating with labeled

512
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,179
edges some of them

513
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,820
the relationships

514
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,000
between these different variables

515
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,440
squiggle in this case

516
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,779
that's funny when you search for this

517
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,559
wiggle it finds this the it finds the

518
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,120
other Sigma as well

519
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,740
squiggle sub Pi t

520
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,340
is not two natural logs being

521
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,860
subtracted a natural log subtracting

522
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,440
another natural log so what happens when

523
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,700
you subtract what's log a minus log B

524
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,640
it's the same as log a divided by B log

525
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,279
open parenthesis a divided by B

526
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,360
so this is Computing a ratio

527
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,919
between

528
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,159
the observation and the preference

529
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,900
if that is one

530
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,059
then

531
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,299
the incoming observations are exactly

532
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,980
the preferences

533
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,240
the preference distribution

534
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,620
if there's a surplus then the

535
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,600
observation is higher

536
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,880
if there's a deficit below one then it

537
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,220
means that it's lower

538
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,900
I hope that is

539
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,159
correct way to say it

540
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,419
um

541
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,000
so here's message passing and

542
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,039
relationships amongst variables

543
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,980
and we we see that kind of like

544
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,640
with an Epsilon intermediating

545
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,760
we see the S relating to the O at a

546
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,100
given time so this is a lot like the a

547
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,520
matrix

548
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,480
and here's the role of policy

549
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,700
now we're in the um continuous time 4.5

550
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,480
Ali please

551
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,320
I think this figure can be usefully

552
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
compared with figure

553
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,140
7.12 because uh I believe uh the figure

554
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,640
we'll see in chapter 7

555
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,279
7.12 I guess yes that's it is the

556
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,080
uh I mean hierarchy the other

557
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,380
interpretation of this uh figure from

558
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,700
chapter four uh in terms of its uh

559
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,820
hierarchical relationships but uh from

560
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,340
graphical probabilistic modeling point

561
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,700
of view and the other thing is uh that

562
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,340
uh I mean the final position Sigma uh I

563
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,340
don't think it's defined explicitly in

564
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,279
the uh text but

565
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,059
it's been defined as the expected

566
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,039
prediction error in the actor in The

567
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,600
step-by-step tutorial paper so uh yes

568
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,620
that's also

569
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,500
I wanted to

570
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,720
mention that definition as well

571
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,380
thank you

572
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,400
this step-by-step tutorial

573
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,900
which is also a four-part model stream

574
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,840
is very very useful

575
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,179
in some ways it is almost textbook

576
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,179
length

577
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,419
whereas in chapter four

578
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,720
there was first the general discussion

579
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
of Bayes graphs like again

580
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,360
one cause one observation one cause two

581
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,299
observations two to one one to one to

582
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,140
one

583
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,179
and then

584
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,460
instantly into the juxtaposition between

585
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,860
discrete and continuous time

586
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,559
as we've looked through today

587
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,919
in contrast the approach taken in step

588
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,200
by step first off is to only focus on

589
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,080
the discrete time formulation

590
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,460
but then they walk through a sequence

591
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,520
of graphs

592
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,620
and connect them to like increasing

593
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,980
levels of complexity building towards

594
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,380
the one that we see in 4.3

595
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,340
it's a little later than one might

596
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,600
expect in the paper

597
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,760
sorry about that here it is

598
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,480
starting

599
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,559
with just

600
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
a simple graph

601
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,480
that is exactly analogous

602
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,179
to the one on the top left

603
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,220
so they start with a static perception

604
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,299
then

605
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,520
in the step by step

606
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,659
they introduced this kind of e motif

607
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,179
by showing a prior and three time points

608
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,080
two changes observations mediated by the

609
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,460
a

610
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,320
this is corresponding to the music

611
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,240
listening example

612
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,860
so it's going to come up later in the

613
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,219
textbook

614
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
then policy

615
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,700
as a way to influence state transition

616
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,020
matrixes is introduced on the top right

617
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,159
and free energy as an objective function

618
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,480
Guided by preferences

619
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,140
to do policy selection as inference

620
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,480
and then finally on the bottom right

621
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,960
there is some Precision on policies

622
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,659
which is just a bringing in another

623
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:20,640
variable beta and gamma which have like

624
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,980
a inverse relationship to each other

625
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,500
so that you can talk about like

626
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,399
um

627
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,260
High precision

628
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,520
as

629
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,200
low ambiguity and vice versa

630
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,140
so it's different

631
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,559
ordering of talking about generative

632
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:42,539
models okay

633
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,520
we're in the continuous time

634
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,179
branch

635
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,020
I'm just copying a link that Ali sent

636
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,279
because I I just sorry I just wanted to

637
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,279
mention that uh The Continuous time

638
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,940
counter counter part 4 that's

639
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,820
step-by-step paper might be this one

640
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,679
from uh 2017 by Rafael bogach because in

641
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,260
this paper uh it almost exclusively

642
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,899
deals with the continuous time active in

643
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,379
prints

644
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,178
great

645
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,659
generalized coordinates motion

646
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,059
this is again bringing back this idea of

647
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,460
the Taylor series if this block line is

648
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,860
the function that has to be approximated

649
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,600
if you only have one parameter to

650
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,580
approximate it and you want to do it at

651
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,159
this line your first

652
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,500
is just the actual value of the function

653
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,899
at T equals zero

654
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,840
Tau equals zero then the first

655
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,700
derivative

656
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,640
value at the time x of o

657
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,799
and the first derivative

658
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,600
then

659
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,459
the adding in the second derivative

660
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,019
and so on so as you add more and more

661
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,600
and more derivatives you'll get better

662
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,380
and better approximation to arbitrary

663
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,140
functions

664
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,480
and you'll get that with a totally known

665
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,100
form

666
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,480
that can be represented in a vector

667
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,299
as the generalized coordinates of motion

668
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,260
and in physics

669
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,919
it's it's

670
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,399
um used in engineering it's used in PID

671
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,580
control this has come up in many live

672
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,539
streams and discussions

673
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,860
because you can say whatever function

674
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,720
I'm approximating

675
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,200
I want the first five derivatives

676
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,940
and then you know that your data

677
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,460
structure is only going to have five

678
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,960
coefficients for example

679
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,359
and they've joked

680
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,399
many times like six generalized

681
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,560
coordinates are sufficient

682
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,780
six layers of the brain

683
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,540
cortex regions

684
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,480
though in some ways that's kind of

685
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
that makes it seem like the six layers

686
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,940
of the cortex are like this

687
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,980
but actually the cortical column is not

688
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,820
like little six floors where each one is

689
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,339
its own predictive Loop actually the

690
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:42,560
layers are connected differently

691
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,339
more

692
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,080
formalisms in the continuous time

693
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,820
setting

694
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,080
with

695
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,599
generalized coordinates of motion

696
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,780
tilde over a variable is representing

697
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,440
trajectories

698
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,460
one footnote is that this is still in

699
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,780
the um

700
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,480
date based

701
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,180
base of Bayesian mechanics

702
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,880
Ollie or anyone else please

703
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,460
correct if this is not the case so the

704
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,660
tilde here

705
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,920
is

706
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,800
a summary notation helping us represent

707
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,180
trajectories of states

708
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,800
which is moving us towards the path

709
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,280
formulation of Bayesian mechanics

710
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,560
but is not the same as a true path

711
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,279
formulation

712
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,419
hope that is fair to say

713
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,740
the LaPlace approximation

714
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,400
is this yes just help me please yeah so

715
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,000
in that in the till the formalism now

716
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,280
when we are talking about generalized

717
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,440
coordinates if we were talking about

718
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,220
standard coordinates uh X tilde would be

719
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,619
X still there would be X at time T

720
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:10,380
comma X at time t plus 1 x at time t

721
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,859
plus two Etc now in the generalized

722
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:19,339
coordinates the X tilde would be X comma

723
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:22,740
first derivative of x comma second

724
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,380
derivative of x is that correct

725
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,599
yes

726
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,240
so oh tilde

727
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,000
with just a location coordinate would be

728
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,599
either a list or a vector depending on

729
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,859
whether you want to you know think about

730
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,800
it in terms of like a list with comma or

731
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,839
in terms of like a vector going down

732
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,320
that time yeah yeah then with

733
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,280
generalized coordinates

734
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,240
it is a matrix

735
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,300
so just it it could be represented

736
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,000
differently but here let's just say that

737
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,740
we're going to be working with it as a

738
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,950
list like you said

739
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,260
[Music]

740
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,400
so in this case columns

741
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,880
correspond to the list above

742
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,540
those are the time points

743
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,579
rows going down

744
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,440
are the generalized coordinates of

745
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,579
motions

746
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,160
so for each time point one two three

747
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,280
four five we have a vector which is

748
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,640
describing the location the first

749
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,440
derivative the second derivative and so

750
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,920
on I see I see so there would be six

751
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,000
rows

752
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,480
mm-hmm cool if we had six generalized

753
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,320
coordinates of motion

754
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,260
and

755
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,740
um this is used and discussed in um

756
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,540
live stream 26

757
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,640
particularly

758
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,160
and several other places

759
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,380
generalized coordinates

760
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,339
um

761
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,060
are like

762
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,960
they're kind of a uh a little not not

763
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,079
like a a trick or anything to get

764
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,680
Dynamics into a static representation

765
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,079
like if you just take a picture of a car

766
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,320
you can't tell if it's moving or not

767
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,480
but if you said this is a generalized

768
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,099
picture of a car

769
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,480
it's at

770
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,000
um it's at 12 on the number line

771
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,920
and its velocity is 10 this way

772
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,839
and its acceleration it's slowing down

773
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,880
and it's going to the right and the way

774
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,880
that it's slowing down is speeding up

775
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,339
then you can start to say a lot more

776
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,900
about the next steps of the car

777
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,300
exactly and that is representable in a

778
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,440
static

779
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,880
um snapshot

780
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,480
Ollie

781
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,359
uh and another way to looking at uh the

782
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:09,380
generalized coordinates is to see it as

783
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,420
a a dimensional reduction technique

784
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,160
because uh when we want to describe as a

785
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,839
very simple case

786
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,440
a trajectory in a Cartesian coordinates

787
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,619
uh well uh we'll definitely need at

788
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:26,400
least

789
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,680
um for example in a two-dimensional

790
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,740
trajectory we'll need two Dimensions but

791
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,500
if we look at it from a generalized

792
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,440
coordinates perspective we can just put

793
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,180
it into the Riemann manifold and

794
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,460
jettison one of the dimensions which

795
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,040
encapsulates that trajectory through a

796
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,500
specific time so one of the dimensions

797
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,680
would be reduced and then we can just

798
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,579
look at it trajectory directly look at

799
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,440
the behavior of the trajectory directly

800
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,640
from the consecutive derivatives we take

801
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,240
so that's a dimension reduction

802
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,200
technique as well

803
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,460
nice point

804
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,320
yeah when you said uh

805
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,359
you said on the remaining Romanian ring

806
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,060
onion manifold he said

807
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,280
can you

808
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,619
yeah yeah

809
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:37,500
because in the uh Punk array or Romanian

810
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,880
manifold uh we're dealing with uh not

811
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,599
exactly the Cartesian coordinates but uh

812
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,380
it's just the state space

813
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,880
defined as these kind of General

814
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,180
generalized coordinates

815
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,720
so it is already a

816
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,500
one dimension reduced coordinate so to

817
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,520
speak so that's the whole point behind

818
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,339
uh this I mean encompassing the state

819
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:13,740
space in that Romanian manifold not in

820
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,619
the Cartesian coordinates

821
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,720
because Cartesian coordinates need some

822
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,200
global coordinates to define the states

823
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,839
of the space but in generalized

824
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,480
coordinates it's more like a kind of

825
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,220
localized uh coordinates not Global ones

826
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,020
boom

827
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,839
yes this is a very well I don't know I

828
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,599
don't know much about the Romanian or or

829
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,579
the point manifold so yes I have some

830
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:47,760
readings to to do to understand that but

831
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,460
yeah this is very

832
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,619
deep and Powerful

833
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,380
um analytical Insight one other way to

834
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,300
think about generalized coordinates as a

835
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,460
dimensionality reduction technique from

836
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,339
a more computational applied perspective

837
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,960
is

838
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,839
if you want five coordinates of motion

839
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,320
you know exactly the size of that data

840
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,359
object if you say I'm going to consider

841
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,300
20 time points and five generalized

842
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,140
coordinates of motion you know exactly

843
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,780
the shape of that parameter or that

844
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,339
variable

845
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,980
now whether that captures whether that

846
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,540
manifold

847
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,500
or Subspace captures 10 or 90 or 100

848
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,540
percent of the variance

849
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,720
in the original space

850
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,520
is situational

851
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,500
but

852
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,000
um you will capture some variants

853
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,680
just like every principal component

854
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,680
analysis will capture some variance

855
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,500
in the space

856
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,060
and whether it captures enough is

857
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,140
situational

858
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,400
but

859
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,920
you know you get some and you know that

860
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,380
you've reduced the dimensionality to a

861
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,960
well-defined amount

862
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,940
which in many cases is essential

863
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,520
versus having like an unbounded number

864
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,980
of of unbounded size

865
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,920
um the motor reflex case has been

866
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,260
especially studied from The Continuous

867
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,880
time perspective

868
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,500
that's going to come up in the second

869
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,200
half of the book it comes up in a lot of

870
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,819
different other cases and in chapter

871
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:33,720
five

872
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,740
motor reflexes

873
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,560
box fortree describes the LaPlace

874
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,780
approximation

875
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,700
oh

876
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,780
there's no again as frequently that last

877
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,060
names don't really reduce uncertainty

878
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,520
about what something is talking about

879
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,020
much of the time

880
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,819
and so there'd be ways to describe some

881
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,560
of these things that wouldn't rely as

882
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,480
much on specific last names because

883
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,180
there's like a many-to-many mapping

884
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,819
between the technique and different last

885
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:07,920
names and so on and

886
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,920
um but just working with what we have

887
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,260
LaPlace approximation

888
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,640
is a quadratic approximator

889
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,520
that is an expansion around the mode of

890
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,200
a distribution

891
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,780
so the procedure for generating a

892
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,119
laplacian approximation is you find the

893
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,220
mode of a distribution which is the

894
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,160
tallest point on the distribution

895
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,660
then

896
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,800
an upside down Parabola is like fit to

897
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,940
that mode

898
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,040
the tip of the parabola is going to be

899
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,599
the the mode

900
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,319
of the distribution

901
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,099
the width of the parabola is going to

902
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,099
reflect a second parameter a variance

903
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,420
parameter

904
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,200
that captures as much as possible

905
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,000
of the original distribution

906
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:03,540
um

907
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,660
so this is kind of like

908
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,359
created if um a good thing about LaPlace

909
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,760
approximation is that no matter what

910
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,940
shape the original distribution has

911
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,400
you know your LaPlace approximation is

912
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,380
only going to need two parameters

913
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,560
the mode and the variants and so in that

914
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,880
way it's a lot like a gaussian

915
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,619
approximator although the gaussian

916
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,200
function is different than the quadratic

917
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,740
approximator

918
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,720
um they're similar because they both are

919
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,700
um have two parameters

920
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,520
the location of the midpoint and how

921
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,400
wide the function should be stretched

922
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,619
so

923
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,140
for empirical distributions which might

924
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,560
not fit cleanly to any specific

925
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,480
analytical family

926
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,780
this can be very helpful

927
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,319
because again you know that some density

928
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,839
of the target distribution will be

929
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:01,980
captured

930
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,540
now if you're dealing with like a super

931
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,359
tricky distribution where there's four

932
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:07,920
humps

933
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,859
all of very similar height

934
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,079
then the LaPlace approximation is going

935
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,880
to get tricked because it's only going

936
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,980
to capture like at best 25 percent of

937
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,140
the variance and it's gonna you're gonna

938
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,839
be very much um like unaware of these

939
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,960
other three big Peaks

940
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,560
however four distributions that have a

941
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,780
central tendency

942
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,180
broadly speaking the LaPlace

943
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,359
approximation does extremely well

944
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,000
some of these subtleties between like

945
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,839
LaPlace approximation variational Bays

946
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,359
and non-parametric bootstrap based

947
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,819
sampling techniques are explored in the

948
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:51,680
SPM textbook especially

949
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,079
all of this

950
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,720
was still inferential

951
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,720
but not action including

952
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,300
and that is very analogous to the

953
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,780
approach taken in the paper discussed in

954
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,900
uh live stream 43

955
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,619
which is on predictive processing itself

956
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,060
predictive coding a theoretical

957
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,220
experimental review

958
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,020
in this one eighty percent or something

959
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,119
in the paper is about hierarchical

960
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,579
predictive processing architectures and

961
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,859
then they go all right now we're just

962
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:31,940
going to slip in action

963
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,560
and it turns out to play very well

964
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,880
here we see a figure that's kind of

965
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,940
resonant with this one

966
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,640
we have a discrete time formulation here

967
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,440
we know that because we see like an

968
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,960
explicit time variable and like a time

969
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,359
minus one and time plus one

970
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:55,859
so that's how one knows that they're

971
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,440
dealing with a discrete time formulation

972
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,020
even if the variables were like called

973
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,619
different things

974
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,020
um in contrast

975
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,579
we see

976
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,700
a hierarchical architecture again

977
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,619
but

978
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,380
everything has been transposed into the

979
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,260
notation of the continuous time

980
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,079
where we saw like

981
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,460
why

982
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,180
coming in

983
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,200
whereas we saw

984
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,879
o coming in here

985
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,920
and that was

986
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,160
what we saw in four three o coming in to

987
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,740
discrete time y coming into continuous

988
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,979
time

989
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,579
so this figure four six is like related

990
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:50,040
to the previous message passing figure

991
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,599
and then there's a summary

992
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,579
so

993
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,040
chapter four as Ali mentioned at the

994
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,839
beginning

995
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,119
is

996
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,740
relatively technical

997
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,079
there's a lot of

998
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,000
techniques and notation

999
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,220
and forays into more General topics

1000
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,440
ranging from Jensen's inequality at the

1001
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,060
beginning of the chapter to generalize

1002
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,460
coordinates of motion message passing in

1003
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,940
the context of Markov blankets

1004
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,579
evidence lower bound and free energy

1005
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:35,040
calculations

1006
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,500
and all of that is being done

1007
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,500
in this side-by-side way

1008
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,599
between discrete and continuous time

1009
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,680
and that is um

1010
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,020
broadly what chapter four

1011
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,920
describes all of that is being done

1012
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,260
because we're exploring

1013
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,420
generative models in active inference

1014
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,880
okay in our final minutes what are some

1015
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,640
thoughts or ideas that people have that

1016
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,319
we can come to next week

1017
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,599
uh Yvonne

1018
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:37,880
I'm past now

1019
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,040
what does it mean to understand chapter

1020
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,380
four what are we looking to get out of

1021
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,859
chapter four

1022
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,180
foreign

1023
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,740
the discrete and continuous time

1024
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,200
distinction is like

1025
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,280
in my opinion the essence of of what is

1026
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,680
in chapter four

1027
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,359
um but I would like to like understand

1028
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,819
more about the message passing because I

1029
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,460
don't really get it all the way

1030
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,660
um

1031
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,940
as I would also love to like pick apart

1032
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,540
and understand the the larger paper on

1033
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,180
message passing by Kristen and some

1034
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,940
colleagues that I don't remember

1035
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,599
um

1036
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,140
yeah yeah

1037
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,440
but for me the greatest challenge is

1038
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,319
that you know even though you you're

1039
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,900
beginning to to grasp the theoretical uh

1040
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,660
details the the moving from there to

1041
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,599
actually implementing something is

1042
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,440
is still uh still quite difficult

1043
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,040
um and uh

1044
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,460
you know Freestone says a quartz a lot

1045
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,800
of time fine man saying you can only

1046
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,599
understand when you start when you can

1047
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,559
do it

1048
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,540
uh but still it's uh that passage in

1049
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,599
active inference is uh is still quite uh

1050
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,300
challenging for me I mean

1051
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,119
even after after having read the whole

1052
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,579
book and you know and a few of the other

1053
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:42,900
papers

1054
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,440
uh so this is the

1055
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,960
even though you know you you understand

1056
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,740
this this for chapter four which is a

1057
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,200
lot of the theory but still going from

1058
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,260
there to implementing a model it's a

1059
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,880
not easy I don't know if there's

1060
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,760
something that uh affects everybody it

1061
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,780
does

1062
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,359
affect me for sure

1063
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,680
well

1064
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,040
certainly it does it's the fractal state

1065
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,119
of play

1066
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,700
at this moment that's why people aren't

1067
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,280
just like blasting out active models

1068
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,579
because there's like a lot of uh trails

1069
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,079
to blaze

1070
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,079
and also just as always compare it with

1071
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,319
a linear regression you could read a 100

1072
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,800
500 10 000 page textbook on linear

1073
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,059
regression

1074
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,859
and then you would sit down in front of

1075
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:36,420
your programming language and you may

1076
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,760
not specifically know how to quote apply

1077
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,500
linear regression

1078
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,119
linear regression has had a hundred

1079
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,520
years of empirically focused development

1080
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,900
on data input output visualization

1081
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,740
training model adequacy model selection

1082
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,319
there are just whole areas of Applied

1083
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,880
statistics

1084
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,420
women haven't turned their attention to

1085
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,300
this area which is why we're doing it

1086
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,220
so the most ancient comparator is linear

1087
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,700
regression then to get one step closer

1088
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,859
to seeing what the theory practice

1089
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:16,859
synthesis looks like the SPM textbook

1090
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:20,520
documentation and literature help us see

1091
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,300
what it could look like and then

1092
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,980
it'll have aspects of both of those and

1093
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,700
some novelties

1094
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,280
all right

1095
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,640
very well thank you all for this fun

1096
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,819
meeting thank you see you next week

1097
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:42,140
thank you bye-bye
