1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,200
all right greetings thanks for joining

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,639
all it's March 29th 2023 we're in cohort

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,780
II

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,040
in our first discussion on chapter 10.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,360
so

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,600
let's head over to chapter 10.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,760
and um

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,920
begin with any

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
comments

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,740
really about anything within the active

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,140
area

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,420
several were voiced before we beat God

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,579
so perhaps Terry

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,700
feel free to begin with um what you

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,680
wanted to point towards and let's just

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,879
see where that goes thank you

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,280
uh

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,440
in in essence my my question is about

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,340
the concept of a

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,920
[Music]

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,120
um

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,399
a system of volitional Consciousness

23
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,720
behind that sits behind the uh nodal

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,870
active inference model and creating

25
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,580
[Music]

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,580
um

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,720
uh I suppose uh

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,759
making decisions about about the

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,759
Strategic direction of the organism and

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,060
um I I find just repeatedly within this

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,759
chapter there seems to be this reference

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,140
to you you know a a conscious entity

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,479
behind the algorithm and my sense from

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,439
to trying to understand this material is

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,320
that it's almost like um

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,079
in meditation where you know the the the

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,180
the the the

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,159
experiences the experience that that

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,360
that almost there is no I behind the

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,720
experience and that

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,159
um

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,979
it just jars with me when we're

43
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,380
presented with a

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,500
almost complete uh active inference

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,860
model or that that where where our our

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,540
actions in the world are actually

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,200
experiments to gain information about

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
the external state to

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,340
um up up ultimately update the model and

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,800
what Consciousness is as you said at the

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
start is is a difficult concept but

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,340
um it seems strange to me within the

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,099
context of this model that we refer back

54
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,599
to some sort of uh underpinning

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,180
strategic conscious

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,900
experiential driver of action when that

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,879
seems out with this model

58
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,519
thank you

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,379
are unnecessary for this model

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,260
um

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,519
Michael Raleigh want to give any

62
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,599
first thoughts on this

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,519
yeah Ollie go for it

64
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,459
yeah uh well

65
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,200
actually I don't think uh they

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
necessarily uh somehow

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,060
uh I mean the active inference framework

68
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,220
doesn't require any

69
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,379
conscious entity in the sense of our

70
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,819
anthropic sense of this word

71
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,000
Consciousness because

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,400
what FTP actually tries to model is a

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
kind of uh quote-unquote as if

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
epistemology

75
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,239
still by uh as if epistemology it

76
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,140
doesn't mean that everything that uh can

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,340
can be modeled with fpp formulation uh

78
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,200
necessarily

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
um has

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,720
anthropic uh this sense of anthropic

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
Consciousness but

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,620
it's a kind of a kind of uh

83
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,040
self-referential way of talking about uh

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,840
the perspective of being modeled so I'm

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
sure you've encountered this word

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,419
self-evidencing throughout this book

87
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,400
which refers to the same concept of as

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,680
if epistemology so

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,419
it's or

90
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,199
um one of I'm sure Daniel's favorite

91
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,400
figures

92
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,139
um in the book figure yeah 9.1 also

93
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,300
captures this sense of uh perspectival

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,240
uh view view of

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
uh kind of

96
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,520
the nature of this modeling is not that

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,840
we have this sense of uh omniscience

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,520
that that can be applied uh to the

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,860
environment or that can be uh

100
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,539
reasoned through uh with uh I mean

101
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,620
reason through

102
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,380
um

103
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,220
and uh that can also be

104
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,620
applied to our sensorium or perceptorium

105
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,199
but it's like we have this uh model

106
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,820
inside a kind of

107
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,020
apparatus that can see Its Behavior as

108
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,560
if uh following through a kind of

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,460
trajectory in the probability density of

110
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,419
space so by volition

111
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,940
uh that you're referring to

112
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,419
it's my understanding that

113
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,240
it's also another term that they've also

114
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,720
used that's related to this

115
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,320
self-evidencing is uh they is the object

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,259
or the agent tries to infer its

117
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,960
environment

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,819
uh through a kind of uh what was this

119
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,100
term in it was

120
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,220
um something like indirect pers no it

121
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,660
wasn't

122
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,560
um

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,979
Daniel can you help me find the term for

124
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,759
uh the indirect perception of the

125
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,620
specific term that's used in the

126
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,660
literature to refer to indirect

127
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,940
perception

128
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,120
uh sorry just a second I don't exactly

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
remember

130
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,840
okay I'll find it and I'll get back to

131
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,159
you in just one second

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,940
okay and I mean I I I I I stop me if I'm

133
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,060
going down some unnecessary Rabbit Hole

134
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,220
um uh

135
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,520
but it's almost as if uh this

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,080
um

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,680
system

138
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,259
active inference represents a model by

139
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,440
which one could uh create a

140
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,960
psychological zombie

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,300
um in in that you know by active

142
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,280
inference without any

143
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,180
um

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,340
yeah

145
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,919
extensive internal self one could behave

146
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,860
in the world uh by um you know

147
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,419
minimizing

148
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:39,960
um

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,919
uh variational free energy

150
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,139
in the way that we behave in the world

151
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,400
and

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,060
um

153
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,240
Daniel then it seemed to him one of his

154
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,060
books sort of talk about that

155
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,780
um uh the RR you know that we have

156
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,020
active won't rather than active

157
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,720
um uh that that than rather than free

158
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,639
will you know and

159
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,840
um I I suppose the the implication of

160
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,860
that is that we um

161
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,900
that that our conscious reality is is

162
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,599
like a a story We Tell ourselves almost

163
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,060
uh shortly after the event

164
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,819
and yet in this

165
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,340
book there is this reference to uh

166
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,279
uh a conscious will within the within

167
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,679
the framework or is certainly within

168
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,200
that last chapter uh chapter

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
um uh five that we're isn't it chapter

170
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,219
five we're on today

171
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,420
so I I don't I I I I I mean I don't have

172
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,140
this worked out of my head but um I'm

173
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,899
just interested it's entirely possible

174
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,959
that um one could say active inference

175
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,420
isn't about what it it doesn't speak to

176
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,100
Consciousness Consciousness is another

177
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,920
thing active influence just off uh gives

178
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,940
another is a potential model that uh

179
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,920
drives

180
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,160
um decision making within the organism

181
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,640
almost

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,500
and that's okay

183
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,680
um but I'm just in I I'm just interested

184
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
in other people's thoughts on this

185
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,380
it's it's it's great

186
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,160
topics so just a few notes

187
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,260
um

188
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,000
broadly

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,339
there are perspectives on Consciousness

190
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,779
well first I'll just note Consciousness

191
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,240
appears to be only used once in the book

192
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
so while it is true that um it's an area

193
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,720
of interest and was the live stream with

194
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
uh vanja Visa

195
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,519
this morning I mean and the authors all

196
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,740
explore elsewhere but

197
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,100
any interpretation of consciousness

198
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,880
I I don't even think it's within the

199
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,640
it's not a pillar of the framework it's

200
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,380
something that is like inferred towards

201
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,760
so I think that will always leave a

202
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,839
fundamental

203
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,060
um uncertainty in pluralism

204
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,760
and then we can think about at least a

205
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,339
gradient of um accounts of Consciousness

206
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,620
in some accounts

207
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,660
Consciousness is um

208
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,940
after the fact

209
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,100
in some way that it could still be

210
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,720
anticipatory

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,760
from a predictive processing sense but

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,480
it does not have a causal power it's

213
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
it's a narrative told

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,760
to um let's say minimize variational

215
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,380
free energy to make sense of memories

216
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,080
and so that kind of narrative

217
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,019
expositional self as epiphenomena and

218
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,660
experience without causal impact

219
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,060
and then that is of course contrasted

220
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,060
with causal accounts of consciousness

221
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,220
and that's where whether you come from

222
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,320
some philosophical tradition or certain

223
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,140
folks psychological Traditions

224
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,200
um which both can arise during

225
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,079
scientific writing as well

226
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,320
things like emotions or awareness

227
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,660
or even attention

228
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,240
are actually described as causally

229
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Upstream of other phenomena

230
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,920
and that

231
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,200
puts one of course squarely in the kind

232
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,779
of Cartesian dualism

233
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,480
area of philosophy like how does

234
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,640
something that is not physical

235
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,319
influence something that is physical

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,279
um so

237
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,399
the the the the dominant

238
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,279
mode to me on that question

239
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,980
is Consciousness is something we can

240
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,740
model about and around with active

241
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,040
inference but no perspective on

242
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Consciousness seems fundamental to using

243
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,100
statistics in this way

244
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
and so I expect and already find

245
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,560
confirmatory evidence that some people

246
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,959
take a more Epi phenomenal approach to

247
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,700
Consciousness and some people taking a

248
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,800
more causal approach for example

249
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
treating it like a hidden latent factor

250
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,079
that does have a causal impact in a

251
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,360
causal Bayesian sense

252
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
and then also just recognizing yeah we

253
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,560
don't know exactly what it is

254
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
that's how we do active modeling we

255
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,959
propose latent clauses

256
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,000
and those become our generative model

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,060
so in some ways there may be more

258
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,680
similarities between these two

259
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,399
than their hyperbolic forms suggest

260
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,860
and in either case I feel like it's a

261
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,120
Continuum that's accommodated

262
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,700
methodologically

263
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,980
by what Ali referred to as the as if

264
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,019
epistemology

265
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,579
and that I think connects to Daniel

266
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,040
dennett's intentional stance like I'm

267
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,320
going to play this chess computer like

268
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
it's trying to beat me if it's not if

269
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,620
it's to try then I then I want to win

270
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,440
so if it wants me to win two then that's

271
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,940
going to be great

272
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,980
but I'm gonna hedge my bets and play

273
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,899
like it's trying to win

274
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,540
and I think that kind of um intentional

275
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,800
stance

276
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,680
is not just warranted it's actually

277
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,600
supported

278
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,760
by these methodological tools

279
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,620
Terry or Michael

280
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,240
well in some ways and we're getting way

281
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,100
off topic and then I will be quiet oh no

282
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,740
this is we're technically in chapter 10.

283
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,260
so we're we're totally on just recap and

284
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,019
meme status

285
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,339
oh okay but we but it's like but you

286
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,279
would say that wouldn't you you know I I

287
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,839
I if Consciousness isn't after the fact

288
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,320
um uh Story We Tell ourselves

289
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,380
um you know it it's at the model

290
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,240
if the world is probably more likely

291
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,760
that one finds oneself in front of a

292
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,940
computer play playing chess uh because

293
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,300
of the you know all of the previous

294
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,980
events that have occurred during your

295
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,500
your life and that you are now playing

296
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,260
chess so the story you tell yourself is

297
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,240
that I'm going to play to win but

298
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,880
actually that it wasn't the it wasn't

299
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,620
the conscious decision that got you

300
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,200
there if Consciousness is and after the

301
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,100
fact

302
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,680
uh

303
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
uh you know hallucination or or story

304
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,579
that we that we create to

305
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:39,560
um

306
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,139
justify the things that are happening in

307
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,880
the external in the on the One external

308
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
State you know because the computer is

309
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,320
in the unknown external State it's it's

310
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,600
a it's something that we have internally

311
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,920
created

312
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,880
um uh as our model based on the

313
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,560
information we're getting across our

314
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,060
Markov blanket am I getting too mad I'll

315
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,360
give a short note and then Ali so

316
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,180
um one answer from a biological

317
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,120
perspective is especially over

318
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,639
evolutionary time but also within a

319
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,720
generation

320
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,839
you will only repeatedly observe

321
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,579
things that are

322
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,579
fighting to live and persisting amidst

323
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,699
challenging and adversarial settings so

324
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,980
if we just say oh well just the person

325
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,839
in front of the computer what would be

326
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,519
subconsciously leading them to want to

327
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,220
win but if we say we're in a chess

328
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,380
tournament series

329
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,959
and only people who have won previous

330
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,760
chess tournaments

331
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,000
defined by winning in this arbitrary way

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,920
only they are persisting in this

333
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,060
tournament

334
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,680
well then

335
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,180
over time

336
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,240
you will come to find that those agents

337
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
are acting as if they want to win at

338
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,480
chess

339
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,720
now then there's the debate well what if

340
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,279
they're just acting like they want to

341
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,139
win at chess but they don't really want

342
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,440
to win they're they're chess zombies

343
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,019
they're just acting like it and then

344
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,880
that's the pluralism

345
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,199
some people look at that chess

346
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,180
tournament sequence and they go yeah I

347
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,980
actually have like reasons to think that

348
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,240
people don't have experience or

349
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,100
intentions or that Consciousness is just

350
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,139
a narrative told after the fact and so

351
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,519
they're just acting like they want to

352
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,360
win

353
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,639
and the other person tells us extremely

354
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,740
intimate causal story

355
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,959
about how the the motivation of the

356
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,000
person

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,940
drives their action selection

358
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,339
but in the end they're unified by this

359
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,620
as if epistemology which is to say the

360
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,199
intentional stance

361
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,740
Ali

362
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,740
uh yeah also this uh kind of as if

363
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,560
epistemology

364
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,860
comes from at least partially comes from

365
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,920
uh kantian transcendental idealism so

366
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,899
for uh Concepts do not

367
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,480
apply to reality in the form in which we

368
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,939
can only think them but

369
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:09,720
um

370
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,319
it is also urgently required for any

371
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,839
theoretical practice to think and

372
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,179
investigate

373
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,939
objects uh with the help of the concepts

374
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,679
as if they were given or determined

375
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,880
um in a specific way so this kind of as

376
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,780
if epistemology

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
um

378
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,720
is it you see uh Concepts have to

379
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,760
um acknowledge that a reality is

380
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,120
presuppose independently of the choice

381
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,539
of uh its semantics or its meanings on

382
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,240
the other hand in their self-reference

383
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,500
and self similarity uh they work with

384
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,280
this heuristic of as if

385
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,240
so that uh it can be constructed in this

386
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,700
way as if reality and concept would

387
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,059
actually coincide with each other but

388
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,120
some recent philosophers such as Karen

389
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,240
broad attempts to overcome this kind of

390
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,600
as if epistemology uh for example in her

391
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,500
agent of realism agential realism and by

392
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,280
means of construction of interactive

393
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,679
discursive in which both epistemology

394
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,940
and and ontology can be seen as the very

395
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,080
same thing and we wouldn't be required

396
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,179
to

397
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,520
draw a boundary between the perception

398
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,120
on the one hand and the thing that we're

399
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,340
trying to percept or model on the other

400
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,840
hand so through this uh intraction not

401
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,140
interaction but interaction uh or

402
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,039
constructive interaction uh

403
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,880
they constitute each other so as they

404
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,160
give rise to their very existence and uh

405
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,780
also I think in some View

406
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,160
FTP is perfectly compatible with this

407
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,559
more

408
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,120
loose sense of onto epistemology because

409
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
one of the requirements of the fpp is if

410
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,500
things exist

411
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,600
how they should behave right so it's

412
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,020
somehow presupposes this kind of

413
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,940
interactive

414
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,740
discourse

415
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,960
by

416
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,360
basically eliminating the boundary

417
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,900
between the thing that we're trying to

418
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,360
model and

419
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,080
um I mean the the model the model or the

420
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,140
map so that's basically uh the argument

421
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,380
behind that map territory fallacy

422
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,480
fallacy uh so uh yeah this is a bit uh

423
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,020
more complicated uh in in this sense

424
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,080
that uh if we want to get to the bottom

425
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,140
of this kind of epistemology uh we will

426
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,260
hit a dead end if we just

427
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,480
um

428
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,600
if we just uh go through this more

429
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,559
traditional epistemology of uh of

430
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,320
Western epistemology of uh

431
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,320
distinguishing between the thing that

432
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,120
what we're trying to perceive and the

433
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,080
perception itself uh but as I said fep

434
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,460
somehow tries to overcome this problem

435
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,419
in the first place

436
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,020
hmm

437
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,740
that's that's beautifully

438
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,340
um uh described

439
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
um

440
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,980
and nicely closed down

441
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,960
um

442
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,880
and that the thing that I was thinking

443
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,500
initially was

444
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,559
um the assumption that in the external

445
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,260
State there's actually AHS competition

446
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,120
happening

447
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,260
um is assuming almost this uh car you

448
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
know uh that that that are

449
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,700
um internal state representation is an

450
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,820
accurate or a true likeness of what the

451
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,059
external status which I think Holly was

452
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:41,039
kind of saying but um I I my my sense is

453
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,620
that it clearly can't be because all of

454
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,179
our

455
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,020
um all of our all of our qualia are

456
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,880
um uh

457
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,220
Endeavors that the the the the the the

458
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,919
the the central nervous system uh makes

459
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,900
to interpret

460
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,220
um signals that are generated without

461
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,960
the qualia that we apply to them

462
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,760
yeah you know these are these are great

463
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,460
one sure thought then Michael

464
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,240
um yeah the internal state

465
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,720
does not in the model does not have to

466
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
have the same structure as the external

467
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,799
state so like often we'll talk about

468
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,720
well the external state in the model

469
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
could be a continuous temperature and

470
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,140
the internal State could just be maybe

471
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,260
too hot just right or too cold so they

472
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,120
can have different structure

473
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,240
and that reflects that they don't even

474
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
have to be of the same type even within

475
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,940
the model let alone the territory

476
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,380
however

477
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,100
by the cybernetic principles like good

478
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,659
regulator theorem

479
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,880
again eventually you can always just

480
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
create an edge case

481
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,460
where the agent has no

482
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,320
um mapping between their internal

483
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,880
cognitive Dynamics and the external

484
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,520
regularities like it's just playing the

485
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,320
game randomly with respect to the

486
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,059
environmental variability

487
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,100
and in a research or an education

488
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,340
setting that may be pedagogical but when

489
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
we're talking about real measurements

490
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,140
that we made even of like the the pen on

491
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,220
my desk

492
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,860
it is resisting dissipation over some

493
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,200
spatial temporal time scale

494
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,659
and that is actually

495
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,640
the surprising

496
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
implication of if things exist

497
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,760
how they should behave

498
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,039
is like well I am repeatedly measuring

499
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,020
this pen

500
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,539
so now what can I say about that and it

501
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,480
turns out you can actually say a lot

502
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,559
if you bake into your understanding that

503
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,900
you are observing something repeatedly

504
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,220
existing

505
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,320
and that's exactly what we see in figure

506
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,158
9.1

507
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,940
and so we we have a a Unity of the

508
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,620
scenario

509
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,639
in our model

510
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,440
via articulating

511
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,159
the partitions on a base graph

512
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,659
so that means they're still totally up

513
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,460
in the air map and territory and all of

514
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,600
that

515
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
but within our model

516
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,000
we're we're approaching that in a way

517
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,520
that sets the stage for people to then

518
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,919
take further perspectives about deeper

519
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
questions

520
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,860
Michael

521
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,980
yeah I I think that these questions may

522
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,280
be uh somehow relate to this Tale of Two

523
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,900
density papers

524
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,860
um great you mentioned last time so and

525
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,260
I my understanding of this paper is that

526
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,520
they

527
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,880
um try to argue that there's no

528
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,280
representation

529
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,500
in the mind but the mind is a controlled

530
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,860
system and then they talk about two

531
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,380
different distributions that I so so uh

532
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,480
so so one distribution is the

533
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,460
recognition distribution and the other

534
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,740
one is the generative system if I

535
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,220
understood correctly but I didn't really

536
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,980
understand how

537
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,100
this distribution how this this

538
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,380
distribution comes into being through

539
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,000
the

540
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
um generative system so that equal one

541
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,919
with an enacted so the recognition

542
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,400
system is the an embodied system and the

543
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,080
generative system is the enacted system

544
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,100
and my understanding is that this is all

545
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,740
that there is so for instance they say

546
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,659
here the

547
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,860
on page 235 the generative model

548
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,100
manifests as a control system that uses

549
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,059
exploitable structural similarities

550
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,100
encoded in the internal states of the

551
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,360
organism

552
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,480
so instead of having representations

553
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,539
they talk about

554
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,559
controlled States

555
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,640
and to understand this correct so how

556
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,440
can that be um

557
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,960
a distribution

558
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
or

559
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,960
um

560
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,360
I I didn't really

561
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,600
I didn't really unders understand where

562
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,159
these two distributions are great

563
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,679
all great questions so I'll try to

564
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,900
address some so

565
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,580
um this question of exploitable

566
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,559
similarity

567
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,779
is very much like the good regulator

568
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,820
theorem in cybernetics

569
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,460
so it doesn't mean that the temperature

570
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
in the room let's just say that it's

571
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,059
physiologically relevant

572
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,159
so there have to be some sensors and

573
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,620
some processing apparatus and also

574
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,299
action apparatus but at the very least

575
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,820
just for cognition a sensory and

576
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,980
processing apparatus

577
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,039
that is able to like measure

578
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,539
temperature

579
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,419
it can be a proxy of it doesn't need to

580
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,919
be a strict isomorphism they say it's

581
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,919
weaker than a strict isomorphism

582
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,020
but it actually has to have some sort of

583
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,740
causal relevance now if you're like well

584
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm in a simulation where the

585
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,620
temperature is fluctuating but it has no

586
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,940
survival value then it's like okay

587
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,740
that's like saying you know cosmic rays

588
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,880
are going through us they don't have

589
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,039
survival value and so

590
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,659
they're not part of the cognitive model

591
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,059
in this setting

592
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,340
um but

593
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,419
um this points to this idea that there

594
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,919
is information in the sensory apparatus

595
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,320
about action it's actionable

596
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,020
intelligence with respect to persistence

597
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,260
why persistence well we could say in

598
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,539
pursuit of reward but then we would need

599
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,700
to ask how systems persist

600
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,600
why persistence because we're at least

601
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,159
repeatedly measuring the system

602
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,159
so again with the as if epistemology

603
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,980
it's as if in order to persist

604
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,200
amidst dissipative and adversarial

605
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,400
settings

606
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,620
it's as if

607
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,539
there's an exploitable information

608
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,960
content in the perceptual

609
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,279
umvelt

610
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,700
that enables that kind of thing

611
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,740
to persist

612
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,900
that's like the tautology that also goes

613
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,500
beyond a tautology now to the specifics

614
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,880
of the tale of two densities

615
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,539
um this also might have been the first

616
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,179
dot zero in in six I'm I'm not sure

617
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,580
in Bayesian statistical analysis

618
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
models can be run in two different

619
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,220
directions

620
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,279
this could be like a hyper prior and and

621
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,440
um here's the hyper priorities on the

622
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,159
right

623
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,620
and the data are on the left

624
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,380
so it's like you can specify the hyper

625
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,960
prior or the hidden State distribution

626
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,840
and you can emit pseudo data that's

627
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,520
called generative

628
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,760
or you can have data and then

629
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,860
parameterize hidden States

630
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,140
that's the recognition model so this

631
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,580
could be the actual measurements of

632
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,980
children's height in the classroom

633
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,679
here's our generative statistical model

634
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,320
gaussian family mean and variance

635
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,240
so given a mean and a variance estimator

636
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,559
two numbers

637
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,440
metaphysical statistical we can generate

638
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
infinite class size of synthetic height

639
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,380
data or from one height observation or

640
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,399
more

641
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,320
we can update our generative model of

642
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,059
the world okay

643
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,399
then

644
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,980
more broadly we're interested in this

645
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,899
relationship between the world and the

646
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,480
agent agent in the niche

647
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,840
so perception and how that updates the

648
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,440
agent's learning and uh and perception

649
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,000
and then how the agent acts on the world

650
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,860
and what they argue in this paper

651
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,760
is that the recognition model in a

652
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,580
Bayesian statistical setting so going

653
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,520
from measurements which might be noisy

654
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,100
and the the height in centimeters isn't

655
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,720
like the real height of the person the

656
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,059
number on the scale isn't the weight the

657
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,500
number on thermometer is not the

658
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,740
temperature like it's data this is why

659
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,600
the empirical perspective on behavioral

660
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,360
modeling is so essential because when we

661
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,940
go on this Bayesian side it's really

662
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,940
easy to talk about how data are

663
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,059
recognized and update hyper parameters

664
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,340
and then hyper parameters can be in the

665
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,200
business of continually generating

666
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,640
unfolding predictions

667
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,460
we have a noisy camera with a blind spot

668
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,260
we're updating our generative model of

669
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,399
vision

670
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,860
and then we're going to be in this case

671
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,139
just creating more synthetic Vision data

672
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,760
in an activism and all of the associated

673
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,580
E's embodiment Etc et cetera et cetera

674
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,539
et cetera

675
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,520
they are focused on

676
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,500
the materiality

677
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,080
of the engagement of the agent with the

678
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,240
world

679
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,779
in this paper Tale of Two densities

680
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,399
they draw these two together

681
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,080
to argue

682
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,240
in the context of

683
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,700
what we'll just point to in figure 4.3

684
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,460
with the a matrix

685
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,460
here two

686
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,500
there's a generative

687
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,940
production

688
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,399
of synthetic observations you could use

689
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,899
it that way

690
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,539
that's the generative direction of a or

691
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,159
you could use a in its recognition

692
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,919
capacity to update hidden States from

693
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,720
observations

694
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,520
so even without getting into the

695
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,460
generativity of action

696
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,760
which is what Indian activists setting

697
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,279
what they're most interested in

698
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,980
is the actual causal consequences of

699
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,179
action

700
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,419
just within a figure

701
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,200
um

702
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,419
4.3

703
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,700
hidden State inference

704
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,200
we can think about a tale of two

705
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,000
densities

706
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,279
and about how Bayesian statistics helps

707
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,340
reconcile this Tale of Two densities

708
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,919
because the same generative model which

709
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,659
is just what we call whatever base graph

710
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,120
you construct the generative model

711
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,220
can be used

712
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,940
equally flexibly to do inference about

713
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,820
any part of it like maybe

714
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,039
um you know the hidden States but you're

715
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,220
trying to determine the prior

716
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,399
so these graphs are agnostic as to what

717
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,100
you know and what you want to infer

718
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,020
now it turns out that for real settings

719
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,299
that we find in the behavioral lab and

720
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,860
out in the fields

721
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,479
we get observations

722
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,419
we don't have access to Hidden States

723
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,460
but we want to infer them

724
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,039
we don't even think A or B matrices or D

725
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,080
matrices exist in the world we purely

726
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,820
want to infer them as statistical

727
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,799
parameters

728
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,500
and then we want to know about action

729
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,399
and in some settings

730
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,500
we have the

731
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,279
um organism's trace of actions

732
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,260
and we're trying to infer their

733
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,419
cognitive parameters

734
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,919
that's the figure 9.1 setting

735
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,200
we saw their actions

736
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,419
it was data for us

737
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,519
and we're looking to parameterize a

738
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,460
cognitive model for them

739
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,659
another setting is we don't know what

740
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:58,140
action will be taken because we're the

741
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,820
ones taking it

742
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,980
and that is like a prospective

743
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,860
application of these types of models

744
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,559
to take ongoing streams of observations

745
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,460
and then perform action selection in the

746
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,440
moment

747
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,379
but these Frameworks are enormously

748
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,520
General

749
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,859
with whether they're used for online or

750
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,560
offline inference

751
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,899
and like what you actually have access

752
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,279
to measuring and how

753
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,859
so little long but the tailor two

754
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,300
densities

755
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,440
is about how the Bayesian epistemology

756
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,480
and structuring of the relationship

757
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,540
between observations and inferences

758
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,440
about observations

759
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,320
maps in the inactivist setting

760
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,260
to some aspects of how we think about

761
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,719
perception cognition and action in the

762
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,099
niche

763
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,619
and their paper

764
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,920
positions that

765
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,240
within the debates around representation

766
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,800
because representation are although

767
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,140
there's different perspectives Etc

768
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,740
postulated to be like the on agent

769
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,960
aspects

770
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,240
that have semantics about the world

771
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,180
yeah and they say the agent just

772
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,579
controls

773
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,280
the world through their own actions

774
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,099
that's my understanding

775
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,200
yeah

776
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,020
yeah so then then the two densities are

777
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,740
on the incoming side and in the out

778
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,900
outcoming side

779
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,000
okay that's the idea

780
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,820
the density is not the the constitution

781
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,920
of the states of the internal States but

782
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,119
the observable actions

783
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,760
we may be stretching the tale of two

784
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,980
densities making more of a um

785
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,240
an

786
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,640
um a set of novels around densities

787
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,680
because it's just ultimately a cultural

788
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,060
reference

789
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,820
the the technical point

790
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,400
is that these variables are statistical

791
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,680
distributions and hence they are

792
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,839
densities their statistical densities

793
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,079
over some support

794
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,400
so

795
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,079
the two densities that we might be

796
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,300
interested in or amongst two of the ones

797
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,680
that we're interested in making a

798
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,839
unified account of

799
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,540
are the perceptual density

800
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,859
which is about how data map on to Hidden

801
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:47,700
States

802
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,640
like given retinal data

803
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,560
is that a car

804
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,900
that's a recognition model

805
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,020
and then there's kind of like

806
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,599
two kinds of generative densities you

807
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,000
could run that car recognition model

808
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,320
backwards

809
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,079
say given the label of a car

810
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,839
generate me cars stable diffusion

811
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,820
generative AI

812
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,420
but then there's also this action as a

813
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,220
generative

814
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,900
step

815
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,020
that brings in the actionable

816
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,260
and cybernetic

817
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,900
um constraints

818
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,480
which is why they focus on

819
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,079
um

820
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,300
the exploitable

821
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,200
similarity

822
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,820
but in general Bayesian models you can

823
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,579
do this kind of observable hidden State

824
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,540
inference about anything

825
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,900
the organism Bayesian brain or if we

826
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,599
choose to use Bayesian statistics

827
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,520
it's going to be doing something like

828
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,599
that

829
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,520
the world has a real temperature which

830
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,619
is like molecules moving at different

831
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,900
speeds

832
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,859
perception occurs through sensors

833
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,020
which transform whatever it is the

834
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,339
molecules are doing into something

835
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,320
totally totally different

836
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
can I just uh make a little uh point

837
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,339
about that that um that I I remember

838
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,480
watching you know Richard Feynman

839
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,880
just a short video where he was

840
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,800
describing temperature is actually

841
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,260
infrared radiation which is part of the

842
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,380
electromagnetic spectrum so on one part

843
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,619
of that Spectrum we see light and on the

844
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,680
other we experience temperature so

845
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,700
temperatures actually a proxy for

846
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,820
um something else that you know

847
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,619
what we the the mechanism that we have

848
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,740
to perceive temperature is then a proxy

849
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,980
for the amount of energy within that for

850
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,260
example room so it it's not our response

851
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,880
to the infrared information

852
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,119
is is a response that's not based on

853
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,880
infra necessarily that infrared is going

854
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,160
to damage us it's that there's too much

855
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,740
energy in this room and the tool that I

856
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,700
have uh to assess that energy in the

857
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,460
room is actually

858
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,920
monitoring the infrared uh radiation

859
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,220
which I can't see but I can feel any

860
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,780
comment on that

861
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,720
yeah like by analogy

862
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,540
um how about tasting different foods and

863
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,220
there might be a toxin like we can't

864
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,900
directly tell that something is going to

865
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,440
be contaminated but over time successful

866
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,020
entities in an unchanging niche

867
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,720
now that's not every case but just with

868
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,460
that simple case at first

869
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,800
successful entities

870
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,960
in an unchanging Niche will come to

871
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,380
exploit similarities

872
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,320
which is to say Mutual informations

873
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,960
between the recognition model and the

874
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,560
actionability

875
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,359
and so they don't need to be directly

876
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,859
measuring or even internally

877
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,619
representing this is going to make me

878
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,920
sick or this is the wavelength of light

879
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,740
um all any and all

880
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,140
informative cues

881
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,000
of sensors

882
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,099
are going to be

883
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,300
aligned towards adaptive action

884
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,640
that's the synthesis of signal

885
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,520
processing and control theory in active

886
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,800
inference

887
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,260
and it turns out that by by taking a

888
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,599
first principled approach

889
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,599
to the synthesis of those two fields

890
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,060
again just coarsely

891
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,579
we have new insights on the question of

892
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,099
representation

893
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,240
in cognitive science

894
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:57,720
[Music]

895
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
um

896
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,740
yes

897
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,859
but taste is a very interesting

898
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,800
phenomenon and that we have sweet salts

899
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,780
are bitter and yet there are I think

900
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,720
there are trillions of different tastes

901
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,079
that we can that we can uh that we can

902
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,040
actually uh create or

903
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,839
um

904
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:24,119
are I think smell is probably associated

905
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,700
with taste as well so you know from a

906
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,579
limited amount of sensory information we

907
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,240
can create a vast array of

908
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,260
um

909
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,359
experience

910
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,880
yeah I mean with the um the Jolly

911
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,859
Ranchers I don't know just a candy had

912
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:43,380
in childhood like they literally taste

913
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,240
the same if you don't see the color but

914
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,800
if you do see the color

915
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,960
even if you try to forget they will

916
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,000
taste different so yeah so different

917
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,740
um that's like referred to as Sensor

918
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,640
Fusion

919
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,520
difference sensors can come together in

920
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,020
the generative model

921
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,440
and it really speaks to the prediction

922
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,680
yeah well it really speaks to what are

923
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,560
our what are our prayers you know

924
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,960
another kind of mind bender on this is

925
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,960
like the visual example there's so much

926
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,119
abundant

927
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,280
um on-ramps to predictive processing

928
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,099
like we don't notice our blind spot we

929
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,380
don't have any blur when we do the

930
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,420
isocate several times per second because

931
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,579
of sensory attenuation you know color

932
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,560
vision and Precision in the periphery

933
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,440
okay I'm on board with a generative

934
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,900
model of vision I'm I've kind of

935
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,000
dispelled this sort of incoming

936
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,119
information camera processing model of

937
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,700
vision I really believe in the visual

938
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,099
generative model getting updated and

939
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,640
it's like but taste

940
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,020
it's like

941
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,780
Yeah by extension what does that really

942
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,880
mean that we're generating our taste

943
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
experience well then why wouldn't I just

944
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,099
generate tastes that tastes amazing like

945
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,140
well why what why wouldn't your

946
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,720
generative model of vision just generate

947
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,000
what you like to see

948
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,400
and that's where the real organismal

949
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,980
constraints and where appeals to our

950
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,520
development ecology and evolution do

951
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,680
come into play so again contrived

952
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,440
gedenken can be proposed

953
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,079
absent these super obvious constraints

954
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,300
for real systems

955
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,000
however in the context of empirical

956
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,920
behavioral modeling

957
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,200
it's usually sufficient to say the prior

958
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,760
Distribution on this

959
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,500
or the trade-off between these two

960
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,819
different drives

961
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:41,579
is inherited from history and

962
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:42,839
development or even from

963
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:46,279
intergenerational processes

964
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,599
but but but isn't is it that we generate

965
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,859
a good taste going to a baker where we

966
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,440
like to go

967
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,380
and doing and going towards those areas

968
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,020
where we get those kinds of rewards that

969
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,980
we prefer

970
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,200
I don't know why

971
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,540
yes okay okay here we were okay chapter

972
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,040
seven

973
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,339
we were engaged in a policy vacillation

974
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,560
we were not sure if we were wanting to

975
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,480
get bread or if we want to go to Barber

976
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,520
so now

977
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,200
um

978
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,160
the question of the taste yes if we

979
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,339
expect and prefer a given taste like

980
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:40,980
sweet and I think this

981
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,839
holds true for sugar but it can hold

982
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,760
true for other things too

983
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,800
then

984
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,740
in the free energy evaluation of

985
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,660
different policies with expected free

986
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,839
energy

987
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,319
expecting observations that align with

988
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,880
your preferences

989
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,220
will be associated with pragmatic value

990
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,460
so that is how preference for sweeter

991
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,900
tastes

992
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,660
puts its thumb on the scale of policy

993
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,680
selection

994
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,700
biases policy selection towards

995
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,260
tasting sugar as a pragmatic reward

996
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,800
but that happens amidst

997
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,440
a relationship with epistemic value as

998
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,560
well

999
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,420
so it's like

1000
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,180
um epistemic value could be pursued

1001
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,859
like we need to find out how to get to

1002
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,339
the baker

1003
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,240
I mean there's there's many ways to go

1004
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,400
but yes you would parameterize a

1005
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,680
generative model

1006
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,440
with a preference

1007
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,760
let's think about this this case with

1008
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,980
sugar in the baker in those two settings

1009
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,099
that we described so in one case

1010
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,380
we're in figure 9.1

1011
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,300
and we're we're observing people's

1012
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,920
behavior

1013
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,480
so we have their credit card history

1014
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,160
whoops

1015
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,140
and we're observing who

1016
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,880
is going to the baker or what they're

1017
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,960
ordering

1018
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,599
or what they're clicking on online

1019
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,940
and now we're going to do inference on a

1020
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,280
generative model for them it's the as if

1021
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,380
generative model

1022
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,780
and it's like wow this person

1023
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,480
has a very strong C Vector very strong

1024
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,760
preference Vector for sugar

1025
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,339
like given Alternatives they're always

1026
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,440
going for the sweeter one

1027
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,480
and this person has a neutral preference

1028
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,480
for sugar and this person actually like

1029
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,839
like moves away from sugar

1030
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,060
as represented by our parameterization

1031
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,520
of the C vector

1032
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,040
so that's one setting we have data on a

1033
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,660
bunch of different entities

1034
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,420
on what they chose in different sugar

1035
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,079
concentrations

1036
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,180
and then the other setting would be now

1037
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,339
step into the trajectory of one of those

1038
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,680
cognitive models

1039
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,020
and now ask what your next action should

1040
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,200
be

1041
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,660
and that's the as if a gentle

1042
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,060
or intentional stance

1043
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,920
so this is the behavioral scientists

1044
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,500
view from the outside

1045
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,839
and then that is going to be flexible

1046
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,560
with allowing us also to take views as

1047
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,640
if from the inside

1048
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,960
and just because we can take an as if

1049
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,839
View From the Inside

1050
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,880
doesn't mean that that's the territory

1051
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,800
that's literally the map territory

1052
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,339
fallacy

1053
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:43,020
but it means that within the limits of

1054
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,880
our

1055
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,500
cognitive model

1056
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,180
we do have that opportunity

1057
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:53,520
um

1058
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,440
uh what one of the things that strikes

1059
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,099
me is you talk about this is is the

1060
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,060
um

1061
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,460
one of the interviews Carl friston has

1062
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,040
done online he talks about you know our

1063
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,160
actions during during the day that you

1064
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,079
know we get up and we

1065
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,420
um have our breakfast and then we

1066
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,819
um you know we we go to the bus and we

1067
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,520
get go to work and we do our work but we

1068
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,920
I you know and actually most of our life

1069
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,420
is

1070
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,520
um little routines we we think that we

1071
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,400
have these independent lives where we

1072
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,119
are constantly making uh decisions about

1073
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,819
what what you know what what what do I

1074
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,560
want to eat today what where will I go

1075
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,780
but actually the person who ends up

1076
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,240
going to the baker will find that on

1077
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,760
their walk to the bus stop they pass the

1078
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,880
bakery and they get a trigger from the

1079
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,400
smell of the bakery to do the thing that

1080
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,280
you know to predict that it's it's it's

1081
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,800
just it's interesting that we don't

1082
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,060
exist

1083
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,480
but as these completely independent no

1084
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,220
matter where you live no matter who you

1085
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,579
are there are so many aspects of your

1086
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,339
life that are just so so repeatable that

1087
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,500
we actually live within a very

1088
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,680
constricted box apart from odd times

1089
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,619
when we step outside that box I I I I

1090
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,720
don't know if that's relevant to what to

1091
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,660
that picture but oh it's awesome I mean

1092
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,640
very very interesting to point to the

1093
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,579
state of exception in live stream 10

1094
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,119
with um Mao and ramstead at all who are

1095
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,640
the other authors Mao Axel Carl and

1096
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,500
Maxwell

1097
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,780
um they talk about like strong and weak

1098
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,300
Scripts a strong script in a social

1099
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,440
setting would be like if we were

1100
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,660
literally reading from a screenplay

1101
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,839
or if we were doing some sort of Highly

1102
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,920
ritualized Behavior

1103
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,339
whereas the weaker script concept refers

1104
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:52,200
to like Norms normativity expectations

1105
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,480
X kind of person should act like this

1106
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,819
I'm X kind of person

1107
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:59,640
I would be unsurprised by doing X up

1108
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,220
what do you know I'm doing X

1109
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,680
and that kind of progressive identity

1110
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,599
capture

1111
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,060
and development of

1112
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,079
understanding what kind of thing one is

1113
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,819
and then

1114
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:16,380
what are the two ways you can reduce

1115
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,780
your discrepancy you can change you can

1116
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,060
learn change what you think that kind of

1117
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,880
thing is and you can act

1118
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,520
so undergrad should act this way you

1119
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,079
know I expect here's the distribution of

1120
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,200
undergrads if one's um

1121
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,119
understanding of what an undergrad was

1122
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,460
was totally flat with respect to

1123
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,960
everything there's nothing that

1124
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,760
characterizes

1125
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,680
an undergrad versus anything else just

1126
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,599
from one person's perspective well then

1127
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,339
that aspect of their identity wouldn't

1128
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:47,339
shape their policy selection

1129
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:51,180
whereas if someone says well as a x

1130
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,359
I should be doing why

1131
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:56,040
that can be approached from a purely

1132
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,760
statistical deflationary perspective

1133
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,920
like I just expect myself to be doing

1134
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,000
this

1135
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,680
like

1136
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,460
or it can go even beyond that too

1137
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,720
so those are these are all very relevant

1138
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,359
and learning about the fundamentals of

1139
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,240
this kind of statistical modeling

1140
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,880
help us

1141
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,380
I hope I prefer also that it helps us

1142
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,660
actually respect the complexity and the

1143
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,819
richness of these phenomena

1144
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,220
which just simply cannot be expressed in

1145
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,319
words or math

1146
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,880
which is why we talk about the map

1147
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,579
yeah one of my wonderings about all this

1148
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:44,040
because I do find the maths and the uh

1149
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,200
the the pictures and the diagrams all

1150
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,140
very difficult to to to grasp

1151
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,119
um

1152
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:54,059
in some way it is there a potential that

1153
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,180
if we really understood the model we

1154
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,880
could start uh uh use that as a system

1155
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,460
to inform

1156
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,819
our understanding of

1157
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:11,040
individual behaviors

1158
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,119
I mean I'm a pain doctor so I um my my

1159
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,680
my

1160
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,020
um my interest and all this is this this

1161
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,559
this this truth that we can alter our

1162
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,359
you know if you are in pain if you have

1163
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,339
back pain you can alter your prediction

1164
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,020
about your back pain and actually alter

1165
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,000
your back pain and I'm just wondering if

1166
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,359
this kind of modeling could in some way

1167
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:41,119
give us a tool to help us to

1168
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,579
support other humans in understanding

1169
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,760
their ability that they can update their

1170
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,099
prayers you know

1171
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:51,720
yeah it's a great

1172
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,000
Vision I think the closest that we've

1173
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,040
explored that is

1174
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,319
um with the help of Ian tenants

1175
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,839
who has a interception

1176
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,440
um focus and this Therapeutic Alliance

1177
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,839
concept where where a lot of these kind

1178
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:10,140
of avenues and like it's not as simple

1179
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,020
as just wish it away

1180
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,180
any more than the generative model of

1181
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,859
vision would be like I want to see you

1182
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,260
know a unicorn in front of me

1183
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,380
so how do we reconcile

1184
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,059
that agential realism that Ali mentioned

1185
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,380
earlier like

1186
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,300
this active co-construction and

1187
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,920
negotiation

1188
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,280
and sense making from our sensorium

1189
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,200
and the ways that our narratives and the

1190
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,420
scripts and the expectations shape our

1191
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,000
inference and action

1192
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,660
um

1193
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,579
and

1194
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,520
choose to have a preference

1195
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,099
and to act to push things in a certain

1196
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:51,000
way

1197
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,740
yeah

1198
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,520
absolutely

1199
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,040
yeah but but but

1200
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,380
I I suppose what what I'm kind of

1201
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,700
thinking is could you have a like a a ma

1202
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,420
you know a a Sam Altman created model

1203
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,940
where you run the model and that can

1204
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,859
inform how that can inform

1205
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:18,440
the uh

1206
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,920
understanding of an individuals how they

1207
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,339
got there and potentially offer some

1208
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:29,099
insights into what to do about it you

1209
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,760
know that that could this speak to a

1210
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,980
model that could be run where we could

1211
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,579
kind of do the experiment and then that

1212
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,480
supports an individual on actually going

1213
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,200
on the course of action

1214
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,020
to change their experience

1215
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,359
that that's that's kind of where I what

1216
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,359
what what really blows my mind about

1217
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:58,319
this and that in the current world that

1218
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,300
it has only come into existence in the

1219
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,359
past month or so this actually seems

1220
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,819
almost plausible

1221
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:08,960
because because of the the similar

1222
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,720
layered nodal systems that the likes of

1223
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,299
chati PT are using to protect language

1224
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:21,359
yes it's a great it's not active you

1225
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,640
know it's not active you could model it

1226
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,980
around a notion of active inference and

1227
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,319
that you know the the training of the

1228
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,940
system

1229
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,280
there's there's so many Avenues to

1230
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,099
explore there let's in our discussion

1231
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,520
next week let's look at

1232
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,720
um that again but absolutely with

1233
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,339
respect to

1234
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:47,339
figure 9.1s about us

1235
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:49,200
the data exists

1236
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,599
the means motive opportunity

1237
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,920
anyone who wants to

1238
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,680
can do things

1239
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,780
and that's a big question

1240
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,280
so for next week

1241
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:09,260
thank you though I'll stop recording so
