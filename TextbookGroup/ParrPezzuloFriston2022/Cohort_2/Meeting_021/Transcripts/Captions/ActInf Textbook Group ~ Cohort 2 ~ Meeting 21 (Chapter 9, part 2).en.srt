1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,060
hello it's March 22nd 2023

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,859
we're in

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,300
cohort 2

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,460
in our second discussion of chapter nine

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,039
we're gonna Jump Right In

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,100
to anything that people are thinking

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,300
about

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,760
related to chapter nine or

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,100
just in general so whoever would like to

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,359
bring something up go for it

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,159
yeah

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,700
uh so I have a question that you you

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,520
said last last time I don't know whether

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,120
it was in what context it exactly was

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,120
that you would you would say we talked

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
about or you talked about

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
um about affordances and you said that

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,860
policies are not affordances

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,399
and then I was wondering what then

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,340
affordances are because I understood

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,980
policies are not affordances because

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,500
they are in the future

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,799
but but then

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,299
I was thinking what that should mean

25
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,640
because the present is a point in time

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
infinitely small

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,740
so which would imply that affordances

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,720
doesn't exist

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,840
or how would you see this

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,619
so if one thinks that an affordance is

31
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,740
yeah if we are in this in one state

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,960
and the policy is a sequence of states

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,299
in the future

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,759
but then even if we have this embedded

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,479
States I can be in the state of learning

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,619
for instance active inference

37
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,579
which also

38
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,560
I mean implies some actions in the

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,119
future so I was a little bit confused

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,700
about this notion and why you would

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,579
think that policies are not references

42
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,340
maybe I misunderstood

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,640
thanks Ali money of a first thought and

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,180
then I'll be happy to add some

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,380
okay well uh yeah actually

46
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,800
uh well in fact in active inference

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,620
literature there are some Divergence

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,680
between the way terms uh used uh in this

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,819
context uh as as compared to uh their

50
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,760
other connotations or other meanings in

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
some other contexts such as

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,160
reinforcement learning and so on so uh

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,660
basically uh in active inference by

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,140
policy uh they generally mean a sequence

55
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,840
of actions

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,260
uh but for instance in RL learning

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,200
policy is defined as just a single

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,300
action and affordance again is a kind of

59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,940
problematic term because we have

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,540
different Notions of accordance for

61
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,420
example in uh

62
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,580
ecological psychology or in some other

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,280
areas but uh to the best of my

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,180
understanding in active inference

65
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,959
um affordance refers simply to a single

66
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,300
action in some cases

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,420
but in some other cases it can take on

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,900
some other additional layers of mean

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,080
so for example weaken ordinances or

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,519
pragmatic affordances and

71
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,239
they they somehow uh conflated with each

72
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,739
other and uh they they can be confusing

73
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,260
to uh delineate which uh notion of

74
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,900
affordance is referred to here in this

75
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,900
context so yeah those are pretty much

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,480
the basic uh or at least some of the

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,340
points that can help

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,799
to delineate those two concepts

79
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
accordance and uh

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,379
policy but I'm sure Daniel would have

81
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,680
some other thoughts on that as well

82
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,540
awesome yes

83
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,720
a lot of good points so big picture

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,940
there are divergences between how the

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,759
terms are used in active and in

86
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,340
reinforcement ecological psychology

87
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,639
we hope and basically believe that

88
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,380
there's coherence in how the terms are

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,880
used but that doesn't guarantee

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
coherence within and across areas which

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,080
themselves are not necessarily

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,639
internally or externally consistent so

93
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,940
policies are sequences of actions over a

94
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,199
given time Horizon

95
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,660
affordances are the instantaneous single

96
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,120
action possibilities described by the E

97
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,180
variable so map not territory if you're

98
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,800
in a maze and you can be going up down

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,020
left right then those are your

100
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,600
affordances and over a Time Horizon of

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,460
four you can have policies of a Time

102
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,500
Horizon of four with all the

103
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,139
combinatorial possibilities

104
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,060
of up down left right

105
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,060
to the fourth power

106
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,919
um

107
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,979
then there are there are those sometimes

108
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,400
informally applied statements like a

109
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,919
pragmatic affordance or an epistemic

110
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,300
affordance

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,479
which is like when action is being taken

112
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,800
that is

113
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,139
oriented around epistemic value but this

114
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,479
is not like a this is kind of like a

115
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,680
modifier

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,919
like it's a risky affordance or it's a

117
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,419
um you know

118
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,639
fun affordance

119
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,400
not necessarily like a special subtype

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
in a formal way

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,539
um

122
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,639
and it's described by the E variable you

123
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,280
could have a nested generative model so

124
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,940
like live stream 42 with a slam

125
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,100
simultaneous localization and mapping at

126
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
the lower level the robot has up down

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,740
left right affordances

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,539
at the higher level

129
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,360
the policy selection the affordances

130
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,520
have to do with locations moving amongst

131
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,020
locations

132
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,400
and so

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,100
you can have nested affordances because

134
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,680
you can have nested models that's not

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,740
any controversial or hot take on the

136
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,360
system itself

137
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,860
it's just describing the model and then

138
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,460
um what we can look into more and what

139
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,900
Paulo is researching uh and and some

140
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,220
others is explicitly in contrast with

141
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,400
the ecological psychology concept of the

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,100
gibsonian affordance

143
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,840
use

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
what was also called like affordance 1.0

145
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,620
2.0 and then Maxwell ramstead taking the

146
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,259
perspective that active inference

147
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,840
affordances are affordance is 3.0

148
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,139
The gibsonian Advocates

149
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,660
emphasize that affordances are directly

150
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,020
perceived action capacities

151
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,319
so for them indeed it is not making

152
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,259
sense that there could be affordances in

153
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,840
the future but people have also

154
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,819
considered planning from an ecological

155
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,680
psychology perspective

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,380
but their emphasis is on the direct

157
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,180
perception

158
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,319
of action possibilities

159
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
which coming from the e Vector

160
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,580
perspective it's kind of like take it or

161
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,020
leave it

162
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,720
the E Vector might be

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,099
known

164
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,039
in a metacognitive way might be directly

165
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,380
perceived

166
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,639
or it might not

167
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,139
sorry what is an e vector

168
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,280
the E Vector is with the capacities for

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,638
action

170
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,840
here and step by step

171
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,520
the E Vector is the habit

172
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,940
these are the actions that can be taken

173
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,039
are enumerated

174
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,700
and the values in the cells reflect the

175
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,159
prior on action

176
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,620
we can see that in the textbook

177
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,870
in

178
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,360
[Music]

179
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,559
um

180
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,359
the figures for chapter five

181
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,320
so

182
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,940
here

183
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,640
we have a dopamine

184
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,779
mediated so neuromodulator mediated

185
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,420
uh balance

186
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,220
between two modes of policy selection

187
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,620
here in some dopaminergic regions in the

188
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,600
mammalian brain

189
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
so in both cases observations are coming

190
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,200
in

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
in the indirect pathway

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,000
the E Vector is basically passed along

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,459
and the policy posterior

194
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,040
which could be sampled from neutrally

195
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,980
or you can have a shaky hand and erase

196
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,260
differences in the policy posterior

197
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,839
or you could have a precise hand and

198
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,440
always select the maximum element

199
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,040
maximum posterior action probability

200
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,620
in the indirect pathway

201
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,779
The Habit Vector is basically just

202
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,000
passed along

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,660
so action selection resembles action

204
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,580
prior

205
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
whereas in the

206
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,140
expected free energy deliberative type 2

207
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,260
archetype of action selection

208
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,019
there's this

209
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,820
sharpening or updating

210
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,320
of the action prior

211
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,140
into a policy posterior that's been

212
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,300
re-weighted by expected free energy

213
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,660
This is highly schematic and like not

214
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,700
all the variables are shown

215
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,459
in many cases

216
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,260
it's just schema

217
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,000
so habits is something bottom up sorry

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,959
and um

219
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,579
and the g Vector is something top down

220
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,820
so that's plant and the other one is

221
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,320
hmm

222
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,579
routine or something

223
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,839
yeah yes

224
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,640
um yes

225
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
um

226
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,279
yes

227
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,399
as always these are aspects of

228
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,160
generative models not of organisms

229
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,500
so it's hard because we want to be

230
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,480
referring to the habits and the

231
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
deliberation patterns

232
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,800
that cognitive systems do

233
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,959
but also be aware that like e and G are

234
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,459
phenomena of our model they're not

235
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,740
phenomenas of the world but that being

236
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,920
said the role of E

237
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,320
is to

238
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
through its membership or composition

239
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
enumerate what instantaneous actions are

240
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,820
possible

241
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,680
if there's up down left right then the E

242
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,140
Vector is going to have four elements

243
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,000
if there's nine directions it can move

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,620
then e has a length of nine

245
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,200
the values within the E vector

246
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,519
are the prior on those actions being

247
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,700
selected in an instance

248
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,459
so if there was a uniform e Vector

249
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,220
across up down left right one one one

250
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,600
one

251
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,860
then there's no prior

252
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,459
asymmetry

253
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,399
towards taking any of those

254
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,600
um

255
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,880
actions

256
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,079
whereas if the E Vector was 10 1 1 1

257
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,160
then that is equivalent to saying like

258
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,540
that

259
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,320
um

260
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
in the absence of further expected free

261
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,880
energy updates

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,540
that action prior will be recapitulated

263
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,700
in future action and so you can imagine

264
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,959
a model where e is updatable or not

265
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,920
like a simple updating model for e

266
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
would be every time you take an action

267
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,680
drop a pebble into that urn

268
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,839
so that's the learning as counting

269
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,579
strategy

270
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,540
which works for for many things

271
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,980
so that

272
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,360
the

273
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,339
um action

274
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,019
prior

275
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,139
comes to embody previous action

276
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,500
posteriors that's habit

277
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,920
and so what initially may have required

278
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,899
a deliberative expected free energy

279
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,380
expenditure

280
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,220
becomes canalized or entrenched

281
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,440
in e

282
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,320
allowing for example skill

283
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,079
or skillful performance

284
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,760
to occur

285
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,320
without

286
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,279
the um deliberative

287
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,480
High dopamine

288
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,740
setting

289
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,160
in figure 5.4

290
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,260
here the dopamine variables gamma

291
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,620
and um

292
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,920
yes two of the places to look for

293
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,740
further discussion on that some of it is

294
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,680
um the ontology

295
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,380
project where with Paolo and others

296
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,959
we're talking about like

297
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,839
um ramstead and Camaro and all of these

298
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,300
different perspectives on affordance and

299
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,860
representation

300
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,120
and also there's been an interesting

301
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,620
discussion about like similarities and

302
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,839
differences with A continuous in the

303
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,880
discrete time model so the affordance is

304
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,060
3.0 discussion and then the other angle

305
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,160
for critical perspectives on the octave

306
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,000
strategies and counter rebuttals is the

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,500
Markov blanket trick

308
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,680
Ollie

309
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,820
I just wanted to point to a kind of

310
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,480
possible point of conf

311
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,459
a point of possible confusion that can

312
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,660
arise uh when dealing with these ABC

313
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,139
sorry d e matrices and vectors uh

314
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,399
because uh it's sometimes it's difficult

315
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,639
to remember which Matrix or which Vector

316
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,040
encodes what so one simple mnemonic that

317
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,779
I found helpful in Remembering those

318
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:34,019
notation notational conventions is as we

319
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,180
go from a to e we move from

320
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,360
instantaneous observations uh into our

321
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,720
prior and learned and habit

322
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,079
um beliefs about the world so for

323
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,720
instance a encodes our beliefs about the

324
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,000
relationship between the hidden States

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,240
and the observable outcomes B is about

326
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,060
the likelihood of the transition C

327
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,980
encodes our preferences the encodes our

328
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,980
beliefs about initial hidden States and

329
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,540
finally e encodes our habits uh so yeah

330
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,480
I think that might help to remember

331
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,019
those terms

332
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,880
awesome and and G some kind of

333
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,620
metaphysical

334
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,420
expectations or something like this or

335
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,139
what is cheating

336
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,639
um so well it's all metaphysical they're

337
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,139
all informational because they're all

338
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,420
variables

339
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,040
although one can take the Chris Fields

340
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,600
perspective information as physics

341
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,759
yeah yeah yeah but that being said

342
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,040
um we continue down the line with f as a

343
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,079
variational free energy

344
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,459
and

345
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,319
um G as expected free energy

346
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,759
um however these are all

347
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,899
symbols

348
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:09,900
and uh there's sort of a a common

349
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,959
set of symbols in some sense but but

350
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,540
they're they're by no means necessarily

351
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,859
these letters I kind of goes without

352
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,439
saying but it definitely can be a point

353
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,299
of confusion but

354
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,980
um let's look at

355
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,540
our favorite step by step

356
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,220
pull in the image for the 100th time

357
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,100
foreign

358
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,760
oh

359
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,260
observation

360
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,820
s

361
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,980
hidden state

362
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,299
d

363
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,640
prior on hidden States

364
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,520
a the emission recognition Matrix

365
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,160
between s and O this is the tale of two

366
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,580
densities

367
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,400
because a can go from s to O

368
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,720
emitting in the generative Direction

369
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,419
plausible observations from hidden

370
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,120
States or a can be used in its

371
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,020
recognition capacity to update s based

372
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,880
upon incoming observations

373
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
so

374
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,220
in the upper left static perception case

375
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,860
all you need to appeal to is a b or I'm

376
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,140
sorry A and D

377
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,000
S and L

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,700
then Dynamic perception it's still

379
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
passive

380
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,940
but it's changing through time and what

381
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,220
changes the hidden State through time is

382
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,900
B the transition Matrix on hidden States

383
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,220
to enable policy selection

384
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,740
at least two other things have to come

385
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,059
into play

386
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,120
well at least one but really two the one

387
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,280
that must come into play is simply the

388
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,980
enumeration of action capacities which

389
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,059
is

390
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,620
listed

391
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,900
in the membership of E

392
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,940
and the cells contain quantitative

393
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,880
information on the prior probability of

394
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,500
those actions being selected AKA habit

395
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,880
you could have

396
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,840
e and just be taking actions

397
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,600
however what is it that steers the ship

398
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
on which actions are selected

399
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,620
well

400
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,380
the way we do that in active inference

401
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,200
is not by proposing a utility function

402
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
and maximizing utility function in a

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
reward function

404
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,760
but

405
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,820
to encode through C

406
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,559
our preferences

407
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,320
what we expect slash prefer

408
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
we talk about them as preferences

409
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,880
because they play a functional role

410
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
teleologically as preferences in the

411
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,179
sense that pragmatic Behavior reduces

412
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,760
the Divergence between observations and

413
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,140
preferences

414
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,840
so in the sense that their preferences

415
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,919
they are that

416
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,679
but what C does

417
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,679
is it's like a thumb on the scale of

418
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,059
observations

419
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,419
not by changing anything downstairs with

420
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,580
the Tail of Two densities

421
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,140
but rather

422
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,080
through expected free energy

423
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,539
selecting policies

424
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,240
that are expected to reduce the

425
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,940
Divergence between observations and

426
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,600
expectations

427
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,580
and by way of reducing divergences

428
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,039
between observations and expectations

429
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,140
about observations

430
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,320
we acquire pragmatic value

431
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,000
oriented towards C

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,660
in the extreme case fully realizing C

433
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,700
exactly having a homeostatic temperature

434
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,299
exactly having how much money we want in

435
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,400
the bank whatever it is

436
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,179
and so functionally C is called

437
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,020
preferences

438
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
and then there's this little extra piece

439
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,480
on the right

440
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,640
that's also reflected in that

441
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,039
dopaminergic image

442
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,600
with gamma

443
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,059
as a temperature gamma and beta is one

444
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,460
over each other

445
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,940
and those gamma being a parameterization

446
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,660
of a big gamma distribution

447
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,299
and then be one over each other so

448
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,620
whether you choose to think about it as

449
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,260
like temperature or inverse temperature

450
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,700
that is a Precision on policy selection

451
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,880
and then last thought on this

452
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,940
this is not the only active inference

453
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,260
model

454
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,200
you could have a Precision on anything

455
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,780
you can have a Precision on D you could

456
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,059
have a Precision on a

457
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,820
you could have a Precision on B

458
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,679
so these are like some birds I've seen

459
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,980
this is not the overall exhaustive zoo

460
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,140
of all possible birds or the one

461
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,520
possible bird

462
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,159
these are like certain configurations of

463
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,679
Base graphs

464
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,440
which we can use a controlled ontology

465
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,120
to describe

466
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,580
so that we can apply them in cybernetic

467
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,460
contexts for example designing

468
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,080
ecosystems of shared intelligence

469
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,080
Ollie

470
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,419
I also believe beta is technically

471
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,380
called stochasticity so in some

472
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,419
literature they explicitly use this term

473
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,179
stochasticity to refer to that

474
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,240
beta parameter which sometimes uh for

475
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,780
the sake of Simplicity is equated to one

476
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,360
in order to not

477
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,419
complicate the distributions especially

478
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,240
the gaussian distribution so

479
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,900
um but sometimes they can be just it can

480
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,720
be arbitrary value of a stochasticity

481
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,299
yes thank you

482
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,059
um and when we see the um the learning

483
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,720
figure 710

484
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,919
here

485
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,280
learning in a Bayesian setting

486
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,760
can be seen as as having a prior on that

487
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,440
variable

488
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,760
so if we have a fixed parameter

489
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,720
d

490
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,960
then it's just like a um

491
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,740
like a Dirac Delta

492
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,760
#category Theory

493
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,520
but it's like one point that's just

494
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,720
fixed

495
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,700
and it's a fixed value

496
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,820
there's two states and it's one zero so

497
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,520
just it is the first day

498
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
or

499
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,640
you could imagine

500
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,720
the instantiation of that prior

501
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,440
parameterization

502
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,100
to be drawn from another distribution

503
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
and then you could imagine learning or

504
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,559
updating within that setting

505
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,440
but if you have just a fixed parameter

506
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,640
then it it can't be updated

507
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
but if you have a fixed parameter or

508
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,580
associated with a prior

509
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,500
then you've opened the door to learning

510
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,179
and invoked all of these other

511
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,039
kind of Bayesian considerations like

512
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,140
making sure that your prior is not

513
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,880
simply being recapitulated in the output

514
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,919
so like testing for different priors and

515
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,659
doing all these different things

516
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,659
for standards rigorous Bayesian

517
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,980
statistics Michael

518
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,240
yeah so in this graph that you just

519
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,700
showed the

520
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,000
um an affordance would then be the

521
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,240
relation between s and O

522
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,900
um no it doesn't know hidden States and

523
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,159
observations

524
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,159
so a is the tale of two densities here's

525
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
the temperature of the room s and the

526
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,700
thermometer o

527
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
so the recognition density is what's the

528
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,720
temperature

529
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,240
given the reading and then the

530
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
generative density direction is from the

531
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,620
temperature what's the thermometer

532
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,500
so the downstairs

533
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,320
is all passive inference

534
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,140
downstairs passive inference here's our

535
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,460
prior on the temperature in the room

536
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,320
temperature in the room changing through

537
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,659
time we're not doing anything about it

538
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,779
and at every time step it's emitting an

539
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,880
observation

540
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,779
where action comes in is in the upstairs

541
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:59,640
with E the actions that we can take

542
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,419
and Associated habituality around them

543
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,840
and then as to do more than simply

544
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,940
recapitulate habit

545
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,700
we have preferences

546
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,000
which have a semantics of being

547
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,440
expectations about observations

548
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,440
I expect myself to be homeostatic and

549
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm going to take actions that make that

550
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,059
realized

551
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,820
so reward learning paradigm

552
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,220
I'm rewarded by having homeostatic

553
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,740
temperature and I follow policies that

554
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,240
are rewarding

555
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,400
active inference self-evidencing

556
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,659
paradigm

557
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,860
I expect to be homeostatic

558
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,460
and so I take action selection

559
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,640
to reduce divergences between the

560
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,520
observations that I do get and what I

561
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,539
expect slash prefer

562
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,559
so so how does the can the notion of

563
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,020
affordances then be explained with these

564
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,779
graphs that you showed is it a vertical

565
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,240
slide

566
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,840
through this this architecture or I mean

567
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,419
it has to do with uh with the o

568
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,940
and with preferences that's what you

569
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,260
just said right

570
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,400
the actions are taken uh I mean in a way

571
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,640
the actions are taken in the Adaptive

572
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,900
case

573
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,760
in service

574
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,380
pragmatically

575
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,960
of reducing the Divergence between C and

576
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,220
O

577
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,340
that is pragmatic value is reducing that

578
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,620
and that's where the KL Divergence we're

579
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,100
reducing the Divergence between C and O

580
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,620
that's pragmatic value epistemic value

581
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,539
is

582
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,179
reducing our uncertainty about different

583
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,020
things

584
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,059
where the affordances can it be seen as

585
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,860
like a slice in time in this graph so

586
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,320
the affordances are enumerated in the E

587
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,020
variable

588
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,380
and in every single time step they are

589
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,659
going to be crunched by G

590
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,980
and then B

591
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,820
let's just say that there are two

592
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,679
affordances we can turn the heater on or

593
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,400
we can have the heater off so B

594
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,679
is going to have

595
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,500
um two slices

596
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,779
B is like a tensor

597
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,900
it can be any the dimensionality is

598
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,340
really important and looking at the

599
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,140
notebooks and the code around these

600
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,279
things is some of the best way to get

601
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,179
intuition for this but basically B has a

602
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,559
slice

603
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,679
for every affordance

604
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,539
so there's like a b like a transition

605
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,059
Matrix for the heater being off

606
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,100
and then there's a transition Matrix for

607
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,679
the heater being on

608
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,360
so like let's just say that in our

609
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,059
hidden State there's three temperatures

610
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,600
um cold medium and hot

611
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
so again map not territory we're not

612
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,840
saying that there isn't a quantitative

613
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,640
temperature in the room it's just we're

614
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,860
choosing to model the hidden state with

615
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,539
three discrete States

616
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,440
and so if the heater is off the B Matrix

617
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,000
let's just say looks like the identity

618
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Matrix

619
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,899
so if the heater is off

620
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,559
the room's temperature does not change

621
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,899
if the heater is on

622
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,720
we bump from cold to medium medium to

623
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,940
hot and we stay in hot

624
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,740
and so then the ones would be like in

625
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,899
different locations on that slice of B

626
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,880
what do you think about that

627
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,340
yeah so trying to digest so so

628
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,820
you're saying the affordances are occur

629
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,980
encoded in the transitions between

630
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,260
states

631
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,720
um the affordances are most plainly

632
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,500
listed in the E variable

633
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,880
however

634
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,340
every affordance

635
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,100
is also represented

636
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,399
with a different transitions different

637
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,940
transitions slice in the world

638
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,960
if there was just one transition Matrix

639
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,940
then our action wouldn't do anything

640
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,899
because the world is just going to

641
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,039
change the way it's going to change no

642
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,620
matter what we select

643
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,100
so then all policies would be equally

644
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,779
meaningless

645
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,080
in service of reducing the Divergence

646
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,679
between our preferences and observations

647
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,260
so again not a feature of the real world

648
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,240
that there's actually a b Matrix out

649
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,100
there that has a number of slices

650
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,539
equivalents the number of actions that

651
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,980
can be taken

652
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,039
but given the dimensionality of E

653
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,039
there is a slice corresponding to each

654
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,820
element of e in b

655
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,220
and then if affordance one is taken

656
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,659
slice 1

657
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,880
is used in the transition

658
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,279
if affordance 2 is taken

659
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,940
slice 2 is used in passing s forward

660
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,240
okay and what um

661
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,059
what if there is somehow

662
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,480
an implication if I'm in right now and

663
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,539
there's an implication for the future

664
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:40,580
and well perhaps not really a a

665
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,679
deterministic one but um

666
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,320
so I decide with my

667
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,779
decision right now it's what happens in

668
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,539
the future but the future would not be

669
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,820
an affordance in that sense even though

670
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,840
it's part of maybe a policy it's not an

671
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,059
affordance because it's not

672
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,200
related to to that transition

673
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
that is immediately

674
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,059
activated that's right now the case

675
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,020
something like this

676
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,980
that that's a a a

677
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,600
commendable

678
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,419
compatibilist position between the

679
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,220
ecological psychologist and active

680
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,140
inference

681
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,419
is like saying well affordances are real

682
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:28,980
in the moment

683
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,260
and so policies which also include

684
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,000
actions that are taken potentially in

685
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,179
the future like imagined actions

686
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,179
those are also those will be real in

687
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,380
their moment

688
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,659
and they're cognitively real in this

689
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,159
moment

690
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,039
and that's why this also invokes the

691
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,820
discussion around representationalism

692
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,679
because if one takes a realist

693
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,240
perspective and says well this is what

694
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,220
they're doing

695
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,179
they're evaluating all counterfactuals

696
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,580
in the organism's brain

697
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,120
or in the computer program or something

698
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,820
versus is this just an instrumental

699
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,799
analytical framework

700
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,080
that doesn't actually mean

701
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,940
that there's an e vector or the

702
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,740
enumeration of counterfactual policies

703
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,220
at all

704
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,539
so the realist angle would be this is

705
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,059
the causal architecture

706
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,539
and it's and patterns in this base graph

707
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,279
will be associated with for example

708
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,860
neural activity patterns

709
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,419
which can be understood as neural

710
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,299
representations of these quantities and

711
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,580
processes

712
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,799
the instrumentalist is under absolutely

713
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,419
no

714
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,100
compulsion

715
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,460
for this architecture

716
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,120
to reflect anything in specific about

717
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,820
the slime mold the ant colony the

718
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,360
civilization

719
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,320
it's not like there actually has to be

720
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,779
the enumeration of counterfactuals

721
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:08,120
about hypothetical action sequences

722
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,599
but we list those as a convenience

723
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,060
and then we can apply tree surge

724
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,418
branching time active inference etc etc

725
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,159
as heuristics

726
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,260
in the space that is combinatorially

727
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,040
constructed

728
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,599
but that from an instrumentalist point

729
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,379
of view

730
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,300
doesn't mean that's what the system is

731
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,540
doing

732
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,560
and that is like at one of one of the

733
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,159
heart of the tension

734
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,540
because the gibsonian affordance concept

735
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,460
centers

736
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,699
a quintessentially realist phenomena

737
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,020
which is what the organism is actually

738
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,060
instantaneously perceiving in terms of

739
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,580
action capacities

740
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,440
chairs are for sitting

741
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,820
which means

742
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,339
potentially under like some people's

743
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,400
interpretation of radical inactivism

744
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,980
like if you don't see the chair

745
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,140
you're not having that instantaneous

746
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,000
perception of action capacity

747
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,040
whereas an act of inference especially

748
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,960
from an instrumental reading

749
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,760
were basically

750
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,560
on the plus side

751
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,280
completely free from that

752
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,560
but on the downside

753
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,960
people need to be very careful that they

754
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,800
don't sneak the realism back in

755
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,359
and say well here's going to be the

756
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,540
central nervous system just conceptually

757
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,339
decision making and here's going to be

758
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:51,240
the nested model of the hand

759
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,339
and then it's all good they go off on

760
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,619
their instrumental way and then all of a

761
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,880
sudden they're interpreting this is the

762
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,140
elbow

763
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,420
as if this architecture was reflecting

764
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,400
for example something anatomical

765
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,820
so instrumentalism allows one to fly

766
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,520
freely with this analytical framework

767
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,420
and leave a lot of baggage at the door

768
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,579
however in the case where realist

769
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,760
conclusions are being sought

770
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,280
to be constructed

771
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,740
one has to be careful that they weren't

772
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,020
actually taking a covert realism along

773
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,560
for the ride

774
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,400
the good news is I think people can do

775
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,480
that

776
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,220
because they don't have any problems

777
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,720
with linear regression

778
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,640
but then again some do in some cases

779
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,359
but the architecture of that base graph

780
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,680
can be seen of similar

781
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,200
to structural equation modeling

782
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,660
it's not exactly the same

783
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,200
but

784
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,400
having

785
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,599
edges and nodes

786
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,140
is not

787
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,000
the system's mechanics

788
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,180
but given this statistical artifact

789
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,099
it's very easy to say that this causes

790
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,400
that

791
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,980
instead of being proper and saying it's

792
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,500
associated with that

793
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,599
especially because you get into directed

794
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,160
edges

795
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,619
it's like well this is unidirectionally

796
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,339
associated with that through time

797
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:54,380
it's like come on then just say it

798
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,460
what do you think

799
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,940
yeah

800
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,240
if you ask me I'm I'm digesting it

801
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,880
I need some more time to

802
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,920
get all this a little bit clear but

803
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,859
thanks thanks so much to elaborate on

804
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,140
this question thank you so much yeah

805
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,380
this is like the heart of the textbook

806
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,880
and

807
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,740
the topic

808
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,599
and this is a model architecture it's

809
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,880
not the only model architecture

810
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,500
but

811
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,380
being able to interpret what these model

812
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,500
architectures are

813
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,020
helps us understand a lot about active

814
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,660
inference and then I guess as we are

815
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,520
seeing

816
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,859
it also shines a lot of interesting

817
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,660
light on

818
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,420
broader questions about

819
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,700
scientific modeling

820
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,099
and bigger discussions which I mean to

821
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,560
kind of return to chapter nine

822
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,060
that's

823
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,960
the metabasian perspective

824
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,000
that's why we're centering this

825
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,260
ethological moment

826
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,720
with the modeler's construction

827
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,300
of a cognitive model

828
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,060
whose aboutness is the setup the

829
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,619
experimenter has constructed

830
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,480
and again that

831
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,599
to make That explicit

832
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,839
and encoded in our model structurally is

833
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,440
the innovation

834
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,780
because upon

835
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,660
inquiry I don't think this is a

836
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,618
contentious layout

837
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,420
like if inside of the dashed line

838
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,240
there was a linear regression or an SPM

839
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,980
model

840
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,500
and we said okay we gave we did the

841
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,480
teammates and we had the rat hooked up

842
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,880
to the whatever

843
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,920
optogenetics or to the

844
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,579
um confocal microscope or to the EEG or

845
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,520
to the video camera or to the ultrasound

846
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,140
it's like you got all these scientific

847
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,599
tools okay we set up an experimental

848
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,520
context

849
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,400
and then we observe Behavior

850
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,660
now what is it that was in between

851
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,119
the stimuli and the Observer Behavior

852
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,579
well obviously it was the mouse or the

853
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,079
rat itself

854
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,720
okay so we want to have at the very

855
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,940
least some kind of model of our rats

856
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,339
that is able to perceive experimental

857
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,359
stimuli

858
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,240
and then output Behavior

859
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,339
so we could put a linear regression here

860
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,920
here's temperature on the x-axis and

861
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
likelihood of eating cheese on the

862
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,040
y-axis

863
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,500
and we make a regression or we do we we

864
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,960
do model comparison we say okay is it

865
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,820
better compatible with a linear

866
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,960
regression

867
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,300
or a break point regression

868
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,180
or a quadratic regression and so you

869
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,220
have the modeling discussion and they go

870
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,040
okay we use the Bic

871
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,579
and the optimal model to describe the

872
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,960
relationship between temperature and

873
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,480
cheese eating is a break point

874
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,940
regression or it's just a simple linear

875
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,420
regression

876
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,220
would someone turn around and say

877
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,740
why would you say mice are linear

878
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,279
regressions

879
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,780
the obvious response would be

880
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,119
no we just use the linear regression

881
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,980
instrumentally

882
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,500
to describe our data

883
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,859
check out the methods section look again

884
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,440
we followed pretty standard process of

885
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,300
modeling

886
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,940
so that we were able to explain data but

887
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,720
not overfit accuracy minus complexity

888
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,940
and we use standard software tools and

889
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,260
packages so that everybody could

890
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,540
replicate it in its open source

891
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,160
we're definitely not saying that mice

892
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,118
are linear regressions

893
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,720
but when figure 4.3 goes into the box

894
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,960
different questions arise

895
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
and I'm not even saying that what what I

896
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,760
have just

897
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,560
um proposed

898
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,320
is infallible

899
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,420
I I think people can have a different

900
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,339
perspective on that

901
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,560
for example they could say Well yeah if

902
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,820
you do linear regression you're not

903
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,260
saying the mouse is a linear regression

904
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,880
but there's something different about

905
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,920
active inference modeling

906
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,380
where when you put figure 4.3 Inside the

907
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,599
Box you've taken on a different set of

908
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,339
commitments

909
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:05,220
that's a totally valid point to make

910
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,839
if somebody can point to those

911
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,359
commitments

912
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,780
and that's a discussion to have

913
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,119
but simply

914
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,339
considering active inference as like a

915
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,079
software package or an analytics

916
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,280
framework for Behavior

917
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,460
just replace figure 4.3 in your mind's

918
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,460
eye with linear regression

919
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,560
and ask what claims are valid or not

920
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,520
and there are differences between the

921
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,740
models so there may be certain things

922
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,480
that go one way for linear regressions

923
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,160
and another way for pomdps

924
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,260
however

925
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,060
um there's also a broad set of

926
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,700
criticisms that people level at figure

927
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,040
4.3

928
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,720
that are

929
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,660
throwing out the linear regression

930
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,259
as well

931
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,880
but it's a format that people are more

932
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,540
familiar with

933
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,099
I assume this this expands much more

934
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,540
potentially at least

935
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,180
but you could generate a pomdp

936
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,859
with zero explanatory predictive value

937
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,740
and you could have a linear regression

938
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,900
with a good r squared or not

939
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,420
it's not a function of the type of model

940
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,079
selected

941
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,819
in fact the space

942
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:38,880
of pomdps is just from a parametric

943
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,920
perspective it's much larger

944
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,140
like

945
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,359
here this is still a relatively simple

946
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,040
this is even without showing the

947
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,920
dimensionality of these variables like

948
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,960
if there's 10 affordances B is 10 is

949
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,180
going to have 10 slices

950
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,720
and then if s has um 10

951
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,339
um hidden even there's it's just 10

952
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,140
discrete options

953
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,400
so you're talking about some large

954
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,020
tensors

955
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,300
and parameterizing them from data is

956
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,520
non-trivial

957
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,680
that's what chapter 9 is about and

958
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,500
that's why we have often called for the

959
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,300
development of statistical power

960
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,640
analysis techniques

961
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,579
because even simple models

962
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:23,280
have many free parameters that might be

963
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,260
related in complex ways

964
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,420
like if C is like within this range

965
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:34,140
then changes in a do or don't do that

966
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,200
but if a becomes more ambiguous then

967
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,000
this consequence happens over here and

968
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,500
those are those those kinds of like

969
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,260
Rippling effects in the model are not

970
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,420
constrained to which edges are drawn

971
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,480
so we need much better statistical power

972
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,579
analysis techniques

973
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,760
in order to anticipate

974
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,740
the kinds of statistical considerations

975
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,960
that people use for linear regressions

976
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,260
and rna-seq analyzes every day

977
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,760
um but there's nothing about this model

978
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,800
that makes it fit any given data set

979
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,780
better or worse

980
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,119
these are all modelers choice

981
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,900
any closing thoughts or questions on

982
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,880
nine before we scan 10.

983
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,640
I I also think it'll be interesting to

984
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,440
see like

985
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,400
as we have more notebooks and and

986
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,680
accessible software packages that will

987
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,980
help

988
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,740
um

989
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,560
support this deflationary perspective on

990
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,660
active inference

991
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,880
because it'll be like well what what

992
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,400
what part of this um

993
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,119
tiger is the is the B Matrix

994
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,380
and we'll have like a notebook it's like

995
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,000
well now here's the B Matrix in The

996
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,319
Notebook

997
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,720
but it's not in the world

998
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,000
and and then just coming at that Nexus

999
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,700
many many times will be useful but also

1000
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,339
I think including people in Empirical

1001
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,020
research

1002
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,359
is going to help with that

1003
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:21,960
because for one who hasn't read a paper

1004
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,819
and or for one who hasn't participated

1005
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,400
in empirical behavioral research

1006
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,319
with neither of which are bad or good

1007
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,000
States just saying some people have

1008
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,579
these experiences and some don't

1009
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,380
that

1010
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,819
um

1011
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,480
separation of statistical models from

1012
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,920
reality

1013
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,859
like mice are not linear regressions

1014
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,640
mice are not pomdps

1015
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,060
that is definitely

1016
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,500
like

1017
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,359
a posture

1018
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,300
and I don't mean it's a facade

1019
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,359
it's a stance

1020
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,460
that is

1021
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,640
built through

1022
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,980
statistical investigation at the very

1023
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,960
least reading it if not actually doing

1024
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,880
it oneself

1025
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,740
like once one sees that there's a

1026
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,619
hundred or an open-ended number of ways

1027
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:18,839
to model just the thermometer and the

1028
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,920
true temperature of the room

1029
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,839
that person will think differently about

1030
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,859
map and territory

1031
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,099
this is the Final Chapter 10.

1032
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,839
in general we are least aware of what

1033
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,460
our minds do best

1034
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,560
by Dr Minsky

1035
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,720
chapter 10 we're going to wrap up active

1036
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,400
inference main theoretical points from

1037
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,900
the first half of the book chapters one

1038
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,160
through five and the Practical

1039
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,900
implementations from the second part six

1040
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,920
through ten

1041
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,780
then we connect the dots abstracting

1042
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,359
away from specific models discussed to

1043
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,839
focus on integrative aspects

1044
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,420
a benefit of active is it provides a

1045
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,800
complete solution to the Adaptive

1046
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,200
problems that sentient organisms have to

1047
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,359
solve this is definitely a sentence that

1048
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,000
we've discussed in Prior

1049
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,740
cohorts

1050
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,959
does it provide a complete solution

1051
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,220
or does it

1052
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,020
set the table

1053
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,900
for a useful

1054
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,599
solution or or some other way of of

1055
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,700
saying that that you know have the

1056
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,800
previous nine chapters

1057
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,920
literally resolved all the problems

1058
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,200
or have they helped us learn the

1059
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,940
Linguistics and techniques that help us

1060
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,400
frame the problems so that we can come

1061
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,380
to heuristic Solutions but again these

1062
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,780
are the kinds of things we can discuss

1063
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,720
um 10.2 wrapping up

1064
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,060
this part all textbook offers a

1065
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,800
systematic account of the theoretical

1066

chapter five

1074
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,220
highlights some of the applications and

1075
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,780
research in active inference in the

1076
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,480

chapter 9

1083
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,599
active inference in the context of

1084
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,240
model-based data analysis

1085
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,099

iguana

1089
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,460
hey instead of going deep down the

1090
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,119
rabbit hole with the prospective working

1091
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,059
memory module subsystem

1092
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,980
and then developing this whole just so

1093
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,260
story backwards from that how about

1094
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,319
modeling a complete cognitive creature

1095
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,359
and environmental Niche for it to cope

1096
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,160
with

1097
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,079
they talk about that whole iguana

1098
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,220
perspective

1099
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,559
and the way that diverse cognitive

1100
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:17,760
phenomena attention memory anticipation

1101
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,020
etc etc

1102
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,440
can be understood of using this active

1103
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,540
inference first principles framework

1104
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,980
active inference doesn't start by

1105
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,920
assembling separate predefined

1106
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,960
cognitive functions perception decision

1107
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,520
making and planning

1108
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,740
rather it starts by providing a complete

1109
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,839
solution or approach

1110
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,119
to derive implications about cognitive

1111
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:44,599
functions

1112
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,599
that helps us identify

1113
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:51,480
patterns of cognitive phenomena

1114
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,599
for example optimal foraging in

1115
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,020
different settings

1116
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,880
finally

1117
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,680
active inference offers a principled

1118
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,300
means of understanding corresponding

1119
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,000
neural computations

1120
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,680
it speaks to multiple levels of Mars

1121
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,300
hierarchy Mars levels

1122
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,579
and very briefly we'll discuss more in

1123
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:15,839
the coming weeks

1124
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,059

00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,300
and how does it build within the lineage

ultimately we are confident that you

1163

will continue to pursue active inference

1164

00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,380
okay

1166
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,700
thanks for the chapter 9 discussion

1167
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,920
we will come back for the coming two

1168
