1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,480
all right greetings everyone

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,679
it is

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,359
september 9th 2022 it's the 15th meeting

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
for cohort one

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,400
and we are uh discussing chapter six

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
we're in the first of two discussions on

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
chapter six

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,439
of the textbook

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,039
we're going to go to the

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,080
questions

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
page and start there

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
where we have one question that we

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,720
explored a bit last week

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,880
in our welcome back

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,960
and then there's at least one question

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
prepared but anyone is welcome to add

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
more questions here

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,360
while we turn first to this question

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,840
what are the four steps in the recipe to

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
construct an active inference model

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
and can we make templates that

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
facilitate

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,199
people walking through some of these

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,760
stages

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
how much model building do people prefer

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
to be engaged in

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,560
in this

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,280
section of the textbook group

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
do people want to have one or more

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
model that they're personally developing

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
do they want those to be

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,920
scaffolded in a shared page to help

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
increment models along and see models

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
different stages yep brock and anyone

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
else

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,479
i just it it's the same problem as like

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
the first half of the textbook without

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
math it's not it's not going to go well

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
this half without modeling

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
it's not

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
it's it's going to be quite difficult i

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
think so um i think we should just get

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
uh that out of the way that it's yeah

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
it's not about whether you want to or

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
not or whatever if you if you if you

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
want to just understand it at a cursory

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
philosophical perhaps level then maybe

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,840
not but if you actually want to

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,199
understand it then yeah we are going to

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,399
have to model

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,120
something some way it doesn't have to be

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
the most complex most precise one but

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,680
yeah

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,520
i i wonder if there are if we could

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
develop like maybe a couple examples or

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,150
simple um

57
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,040
[Music]

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
ones that people might like to model

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
i don't know yeah

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
those are all going to be purely

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,839
agent-based but

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
thanks

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
i agree

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
i wanted to frame it as a question but i

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,879
agree with that

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,080
perspective

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,440
um

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
and following along

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,740
as we we um

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,120
[Music]

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
structure

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
a few specific cases

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
the rat and the teammates

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,920
the icicating

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,879
which are used in the textbook

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
then some of the examples that are used

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
recurrently in the literature

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
like birdsong and a few others

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,959
and for these many scripts

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,560
exist

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,950
and helping people who

82
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,879
[Music]

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
might not have the setup

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
either by with some walkthroughs okay

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
here's how you get octave running so you

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,879
can do this matlab script or here's the

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
standalone dem demo

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
because this textbook really only gives

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
the pointer to matlab

90
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
scripts and methods

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,360
like when they say um

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
that the standard schemes can be applied

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
they mean

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
a matlab script

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
and that's exactly what the step-by-step

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
guide model stream one

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
is built around

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,239
and

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,599
chapter seven

100
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,080
on modeling and discrete time

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
is going to

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,799
be

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
akin to the step-by-step guide

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
but it's not

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
um step by step by step by step

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
it's more like it takes two

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,839
bigger steps

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,719
um okay

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,839
how is this

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,160
four-step recipe

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,479
for active inference modeling similar or

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,360
different than approaches that people

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
have seen

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
for systems modeling from other

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,360
frameworks

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,710
for example in a reinforcement learning

117
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,919
[Music]

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,280
or cybernetic modeling so something more

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
recent and computational

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,159
or something more

121
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,520
pre-formal or computational

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
should this recipe be surprising to

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,320
people coming from a certain background

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
are there sub steps that are relevant to

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,199
consider brock yes

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
um

127
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,919
i don't have you know extensive

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,280
um

129
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
like formal modeling experience

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,960
but i

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
just necessarily kind of most of the

132
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
things that i've done for the last

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
half decade like entail some form of

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
this and i

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
don't see how you could

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
model anything without going through

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
these um

138
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
basic questions here like this is

139
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
it's a

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
bit

141
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
i don't see how this is specific or

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
um

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
exclusive or whatever to active

144
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,719
inference it's a bit

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
ambiguous to me how that yeah i mean

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
besides specifically degenerate model i

147
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
guess but

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
um

149
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
which system are we modeling another way

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
to ask that is what questions are we

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
trying to answer

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,720
um

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
or who

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
i think lyle brought this up like who's

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
the who are you making the model for

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
sort of thing

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,800
um

158
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,800
because the same like you were saying in

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
the

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,120
just earlier about

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
um

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
the particular choice of how you're

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
modeling it

164
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,919
uh

165
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,199
is just a choice on that system

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,160
and that has that entails you know

167
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
particular

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,639
uh

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,080
kind of

170
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
hidden states

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,080
marco blanket et cetera that um

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,600
may be relevant or may not be depending

173
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,039
on the questions you know what you're

174
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
trying to model um

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
but that that arises from those

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,840
questions i guess is what i'm

177
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,799
saying thank you ali

178
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
uh well

179
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,800
yeah

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,599
i just wanted to mention that um

181
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,919
referring back to your previous question

182
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,599
uh i also

183
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,360
i'm currently developing

184
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
a model and actually

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
an emotion perceiving agent uh

186
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
by

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
pretty much closely following those four

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
steps

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,759
but i'm getting some helps in that

190
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
regard and how to actually implement

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
those four steps in uh in my uh

192
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
particular situation

193
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,360
but um on the topic of modeling uh well

194
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,639
at a very basic level we can

195
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
um

196
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
categorize different approaches to

197
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,759
modeling um in terms of answering to two

198
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,840
to three different questions

199
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,199
uh the watt models the how models and

200
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,720
the y models

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
at least that's the kind of approach um

202
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,879
mostly done in neuroscientific modeling

203
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,680
so

204
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
uh in my opinion uh this these

205
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
four steps and this recipe

206
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,680
uh

207
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
can

208
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
be applied

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,479
mostly to

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,680
the how and the why

211
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
what models are

212
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,240
mostly a descriptive models of phenomena

213
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
so um

214
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,799
i think my connection

215
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
yeah you're about here

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,799
what models are mostly

217
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,599
yeah

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
mostly uh the descript descriptive

219
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,200
models uh and uh but

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
when we want to

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
uh model an agent uh a self-evidencing

222
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,560
agent which tries to um

223
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
which behaves as if

224
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
uh it

225
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
infers something about its environment

226
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
uh we have moved beyond uh just a

227
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,279
descriptive stage and we're dealing with

228
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,959
the how and

229
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,279
probably even the why questions there

230
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
thanks when i hear why i always think of

231
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
tim bergens four questions the four wise

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,519
aristotle's four y's

233
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,720
y

234
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
is a subjective

235
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
modelers

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
pluralistic playground

237
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,120
and it doesn't lend itself to one

238
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,080
specific even type of answer let alone a

239
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
framing or a specific parameter

240
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,320
combination

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
and i think that's a huge aspect of the

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
move from like

243
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
what are systems

244
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
to how am i going to model the system

245
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
which is a part of the turn that happens

246
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
when we start to model

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,160
is

248
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
we dispense with absolutism

249
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,519
all of a sudden these questions about

250
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
what we're trying to do

251
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
our preferences and affordances and

252
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,279
constraints

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,200
and limitations and everything come into

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
play

255
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
and we might make a portfolio of models

256
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,079
that are shining light on different

257
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,839
aspects of even the very same

258
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,399
phenomena

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
so it's kind of like an empirically

260
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,680
grounded pluralism and pragmatism

261
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,079
when we start to be engaged in real

262
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
useful modeling

263
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,440
and that is something that

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
i feel that one learns on the field

265
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,440
not necessarily

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
um

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,839
bystanding so that's just to say that

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,720
the modeling is really important

269
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,279
even for philosophical reasons

270
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,640
to say nothing of some of the things

271
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
that are coming to play in chapter seven

272
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,399
and beyond where it's like yeah the c

273
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
vector has this many

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,160
entries

275
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
because why

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
and how many rows and columns does this

277
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,920
have

278
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
but once we understand why the rows and

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
the columns and the shapes of these

280
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
different entities

281
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
are the way they are

282
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,959
then

283
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,160
we just have to use this scaffold to

284
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
think about certain

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
systems

286
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,200
consider their form

287
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
at a very structural level

288
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
like is it in discrete time or in

289
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,279
continuous time and so on

290
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,560
and then

291
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,079
we might set up

292
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,880
not just one generative model but again

293
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
families of them

294
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
in the future we hope and expect that

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,079
active block friends will facilitate us

296
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
doing parameter sweeps across families

297
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
of cognitive models and generative

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
models

299
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
um but even in this boutique

300
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,880
phase

301
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
of model construction that we're in

302
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
in current year

303
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
one would still say okay i want to have

304
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
one model where it's either acceptable

305
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
temperature or too hot and i want to

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,560
have one with a three-state model too

307
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,040
cold just right too hot here's going to

308
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,720
be a four stage model

309
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,720
and just being able to specify that

310
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
again instills pluralism through action

311
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
about how we're modeling a system

312
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
which is the philosophical point that it

313
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,479
seems like sometimes isn't

314
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,200
grasped

315
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,920
by those who don't engage

316
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,480
in the specific discussions around

317
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,120
modeling a system

318
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
um

319
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,760
okay

320
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
so

321
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,959
where does figure 6.1 come into play

322
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,519
a rehearsal

323
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
of some of the

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
figures we've seen earlier in the book

325
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
and many many other places

326
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
this is the particular partition

327
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,240
the particle is the internal and the

328
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
active sensory states so internal plus

329
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
blanket states equals particular states

330
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
those are the particles if we were

331
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,040
looking at dust under the microscope

332
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
like brownian motion was describing

333
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
initially the particles were the dust

334
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,959
particle

335
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,120
and then the external states were like

336
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,839
that which was not the dust particle

337
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
partitioning the generative process and

338
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,120
the generative model off from each other

339
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
we're dealing in bayesian mechanics

340
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
with particular states with particles

341
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
with things

342
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,560
that are able to engage in sensory motor

343
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,519
type

344
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,680
loops

345
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,399
this is just bringing in a few

346
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,200
uh more

347
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,720
pieces than that

348
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
which is just to call attention to the

349
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,800
direction and the existence of the

350
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,480
arrows

351
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
in

352
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
the work how particular is the free

353
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
energy principle of aguilera at all and

354
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,480
in follow-up work

355
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,360
there's discussion around

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
which

357
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
topologies

358
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
on this particular partition

359
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
facilitate or enable

360
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,720
which kinds of formal claims to be made

361
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,079
for example

362
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,839
one might find it kind of interesting

363
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,160
that sensory states have a bidirectional

364
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
arrow with external states

365
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
or might find it

366
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,720
equally interesting or differently

367
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,880
interesting or less interesting that

368
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
also active states

369
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,079
have

370
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,160
an arrow pointing back to internal

371
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,680
states

372
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,279
and

373
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,680
of course the questions that we

374
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
have raised all along the way of like

375
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
okay let's just say that we're gonna

376
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,480
model

377
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,839
a person's

378
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,959
arm what are the active states

379
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
what are the sensory states

380
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,320
what does it mean that there's a

381
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
bi-directional arrow connecting them

382
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
is this the only

383
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,920
topology for this particular partition

384
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,920
could we have the around the clock model

385
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
external states influencing sensory then

386
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
internal then active and just going

387
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,680
around the clock

388
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
without any crosstalk in the blanket

389
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
without any back arrows

390
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
is that

391
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
plausible

392
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,839
does that change the formalism

393
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
on one hand how could it not

394
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
change the formalism

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
when it's changing the structure of how

396
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
variables are related to each other

397
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
or maybe there are formalisms that are

398
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,639
actually abstracted away

399
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,800
from any

400
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,839
topology

401
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,399
choice

402
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,279
because what is being described

403
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
are the flows

404
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
and the gradients on

405
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,240
these variables

406
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,600
but then what are those variables

407
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
i think

408
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
i mean that just highlights this need

409
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
for for modeling but if we if we just

410
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
really briefly go back to that uh

411
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
one

412
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,360
um

413
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
it's like

414
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,160
the fact that there's this

415
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
bi-directional arrow between external

416
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,519
states and sensory states

417
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,000
is um

418
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
a bit confusing

419
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,959
um in that

420
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
again the language like

421
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
well if it is acting on the environment

422
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
isn't that an action state you know or

423
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,199
something like this um

424
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,399
in what way is it bidirectional so so

425
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,320
could you not draw that as two you know

426
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
one arrow going to the sensory state one

427
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,799
arrow from the sensory state to back to

428
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
the environment and then say

429
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
what functionally

430
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,919
does that entail

431
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,919
um and then you're you're doing this

432
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
particular selection

433
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
of of how you're modeling right

434
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,319
but i think you have to do that

435
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,559
um to understand why that is

436
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,400
bi-directional there

437
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,919
right um in that particular framing of

438
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,440
the generated process generate model

439
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
there right

440
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,200
um

441
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,600
which is

442
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
still to me also

443
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,799
slightly nebulous but uh i think

444
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
yeah just i the bi-directionality of it

445
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
between the action and sense states that

446
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,440
kind of makes sense almost um

447
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,039
that you sense your actions and your

448
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
actions or response to your sins but

449
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,039
that's not really what's being done

450
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,679
there precisely either right so

451
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
um

452
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
just explicating that is what yeah we

453
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,399
need to

454
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,200
separate and explicate what

455
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
yeah

456
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
yeah

457
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
another really important

458
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
question is like

459
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,400
this action perception loop is appealed

460
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,919
to

461
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
early and often it's the first picture

462
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
in the textbook

463
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,799
before the high road in the low road in

464
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,559
1.2

465
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,480
is one one

466
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
we're talking about

467
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,120
agents and they're interfacing with the

468
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,440
niche and we're going to end up calling

469
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
how we model asian degenerative model

470
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
and we're going to end up calling the

471
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
niche and the dynamics of a niche and

472
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
how it's influenced as the generative

473
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,640
process

474
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
and we're going to call the interface

475
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,679
between the generative model and

476
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,919
generative process markov blanket and

477
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,280
it's going to inherit this technical

478
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,600
definition from base graphs

479
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
and we're going to add these variables

480
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
and we're going to connect them a

481
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
certain way

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
but we're talking about the feedback

483
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
loop with the agent and the niche

484
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
oh

485
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,320
so what is this then

486
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,080
are the observations

487
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,799
the sensory states

488
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,799
and this isn't just like a a low-hanging

489
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,799
fruit like well then why isn't it like

490
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,919
um

491
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
you know why couldn't we call them

492
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
i mean they are called

493
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,160
as x and y

494
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
interestingly in the continuous time

495
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
formulation

496
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,280
and i get it that they're being

497
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
distinguished here

498
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,840
um

499
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
because this is the continuous time

500
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
pomdp and the um

501
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,840
discrete time pomdp

502
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,200
um but

503
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
where do we see

504
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,440
active states here

505
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,520
we see policies

506
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,400
so are active states along the branch

507
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,919
influencing

508
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,880
the b

509
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,799
matrix how the hidden states change

510
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
through time

511
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
so

512
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
there may be a very simple

513
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
um trail

514
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
from

515
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,320
this action perception loop

516
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,159
framing

517
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,600
to

518
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,120
the discrete and continuous time pomdps

519
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,480
yeah i think just to me the simple way

520
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
if you instead of thinking of this as a

521
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
circular thing where you're literally

522
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
going

523
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,039
from one state to the next state to the

524
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,640
way you might do in a normal state

525
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,039
machine if you're thinking of no the

526
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,280
active when you have an active state

527
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
that

528
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,520
however it is changing

529
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
that is necessarily entailing change in

530
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,559
the sensory external state and the

531
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
internal states

532
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,240
and and vice versa here with the sensory

533
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
states like

534
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
that if you if you perform some action

535
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,720
of some kind there's some active

536
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
change in that state like you're

537
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
necessarily

538
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,600
changing the internal hidden state

539
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,480
right

540
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
um

541
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,720
so like if you

542
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,520
uh

543
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,880
you know grab a

544
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
glass of water or something like this

545
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
like the what you're modeling

546
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,799
now has

547
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,320
changed

548
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
slightly right

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
and the sensors your internal states and

550
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,919
the sensory states

551
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,000
are doing the same thing where you know

552
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,360
for the glass of water or whatever was

553
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
this

554
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,039
you know

555
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,080
uh

556
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
object just sitting there

557
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,559
doing nothing but now

558
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
it's become a thing to to drink out of

559
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,520
and that's changed in some sense the

560
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,200
kind of external states that are being

561
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,440
fed into your sensory states right like

562
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
it it's changed

563
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,880
the markov blanket that you're kind of

564
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,840
selecting for or relating to

565
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,158
um

566
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
and i mean that

567
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,480
yeah the pumdp it's i mean i think that

568
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,679
is

569
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
visibly their you know do the same sort

570
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
of thing where

571
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,159
if you have

572
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
this observation you're necessarily

573
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
creating a

574
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
new internal you know or sense state

575
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,559
that is going to change your policy

576
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
selection so

577
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,559
and that's going to change your your

578
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,000
sense states

579
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
so

580
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
returning to the recipe one question

581
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,480
that i think

582
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,320
will reduce our uncertainty about as we

583
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,559
really do the modeling

584
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,559
is

585
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,639
um

586
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,080
how do we account for residuals

587
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,760
and understand which modeling residuals

588
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
which is to say

589
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,480
variability

590
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
in data that are not explained by the

591
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,520
model

592
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,200
which and what amounts of residuals are

593
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,480
acceptable

594
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,960
so if we're doing a linear regression

595
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,520
and the only data we had on hand was

596
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,679
height and the only data that we wanted

597
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,840
to predict were weight

598
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
then

599
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,159
we could just say we've used all the

600
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,120
data

601
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,400
and whether

602
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
the model fits um with an r value of 0.1

603
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,240
or 0.9

604
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
we know what the residual is

605
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,280
of

606
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,600
height on weight regression

607
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,679
and here's a number that describes what

608
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
fraction of the variability was

609
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,400
described

610
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,880
with this regression our value of one

611
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
being like it's all perfectly on a line

612
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,520
our value of zero being like it's just a

613
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
total scatter plot

614
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,039
we can say how much variability is

615
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,400
explained

616
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,279
and then

617
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,799
we're done with the empirical data that

618
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,520
we had so we can't explain any more

619
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,240
variability

620
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,279
when we're looking at empirical traces

621
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,000
of behavior

622
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
to

623
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,240
explain even a small fraction

624
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,880
of behavior for some systems

625
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,559
it might be the case that the generative

626
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,720
models already must be quite complex

627
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
in another scenario it might be the case

628
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,039
that a very simple

629
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,000
model

630
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,799
like

631
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
um

632
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,200
looks to the left are are uh

633
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
90 of the time followed by looking to

634
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,880
the right

635
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,880
i mean on average isn't that true

636
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
so then when we are evaluating models

637
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
whether in block prints sweeping across

638
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,120
models or just qualitatively or in a

639
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,840
boutique way

640
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
are we looking to reduce the residual

641
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
to zero

642
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,200
what traces of data are we looking to

643
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,559
explain variability in

644
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,279
and then if we're not going to be

645
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
with empirical traces of behavior

646
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
looking to reduce our

647
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,279
unexplained variance

648
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,880
what is going to be the criteria

649
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,840
by which we do model selection on

650
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,480
the aic and the bic

651
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
which are information criteria

652
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
balance

653
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,600
variability explained

654
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,679
across families of models

655
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,559
with their degree of parameterization

656
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
penalizing having more parameters

657
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,279
rewarding better explanations so seeking

658
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,039
to find a balance

659
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,159
with

660
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,159
models that are on the kind of pareto

661
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,520
frontier

662
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,960
of explanatory and simple

663
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
that's great that's like one extra

664
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,520
nuance on top of merely

665
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
explaining more variability with a

666
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
smaller residual

667
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,720
it also adds in the penalty for having

668
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
more parameters so that

669
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,400
um in theory and in practice

670
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,960
stops the modeler

671
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,799
from just okay well now we're going to

672
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
add in the temperature in this other

673
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,240
part of the world because one percent of

674
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
the variability just happened to be

675
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,320
explained so now we're just developing

676
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,720
these like totally spiraling looking for

677
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,600
more and more data sources to explain a

678
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
decreasing amount of variability that's

679
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,880
left

680
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,240
so it's good to pull back from that edge

681
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,720
through the use of information criteria

682
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
but at the core of the criterion is

683
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,240
still

684
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,600
the imperative to reduce the residual

685
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,120
to have a model that fits

686
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,679
within a model the way that we fine-tune

687
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,480
it

688
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,320
so that it fits data well but not

689
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,679
overfitting

690
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,200
and then across models we can see an

691
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,679
analogous process of wanting to model

692
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,799
structure

693
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,960
that fits without for example

694
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
overfitting or over-including parameters

695
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,919
um so i think one question

696
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,400
which might be added here is like

697
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,679
what data do we have

698
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,919
if we're doing a didactic model

699
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,159
and we just want to sketch it out and

700
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,400
run run a simulation and just purely

701
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
generate data

702
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,760
that might be useful in certain settings

703
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,720
but

704
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,480
the question of what behavioral data we

705
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,200
have is very non-trivial if we're going

706
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,720
to be approaching this as an empirical

707
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,919
analysis problem brock

708
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,360
just another question there um for

709
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,840
us what

710
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,320
uh what observations must we make or

711
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
something is the

712
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
related what data do we have

713
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,960
if you don't have the data that

714
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,320
there's if there's not sufficient

715
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
affordance information contained in the

716
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,000
data to model the problem then

717
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,039
do we have to model our action selection

718
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,679
at a second

719
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,039
or third

720
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,039
order

721
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,840
yeah exactly to find yeah to realize the

722
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,639
right epistemic value

723
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
okay

724
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
so that was figure six one

725
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,720
discrete and continuous

726
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,080
shallow deep and hierarchical

727
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
so just to

728
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
address this which might come up

729
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,919
shallow versus deep

730
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,520
is describing

731
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,760
how iterated

732
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
the

733
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,000
model is through time

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
within

735
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
one type of time

736
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
so you could have the one hour shallow

737
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,480
model

738
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
where hours are are units

739
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,399
or you could have the 10 hours where it

740
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,320
goes one two three four five six seven

741
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
eight nine ten or you could have a

742
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,919
hundred depth of a hundred with a time

743
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,279
click of one

744
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,240
or

745
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,399
one could have a hierarchical model

746
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,960
where there's 10 hours that make like a

747
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
deca hour

748
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,440
and then

749
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,559
there's 10 clicks of the deca hour

750
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,840
to reach

751
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,919
a planning horizon

752
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
of 100 time steps

753
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,120
so

754
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,279
deep is describing

755
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,320
within

756
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,159
one unit

757
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,799
or counter of time

758
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,320
how iterated

759
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,279
that counter is

760
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,039
depth is describing strict hierarchical

761
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,480
nesting

762
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,640
and so um they can both be used

763
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
separately or together

764
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,000
to describe

765
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,799
events over longer and longer time

766
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,520
horizons

767
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,679
crucially this is in the context of

768
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,200
language processing

769
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
the duration of the word transcends that

770
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
of any phoneme

771
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,600
and the sentence transcends that of any

772
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,679
word in the sequence

773
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,480
and

774
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
if we assume paragraphs are made of

775
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,600
multiple sentences

776
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,840
paragraphs always transcend and

777
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,320
encompass sentences so

778
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
anyone else want to just add up a point

779
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,559
i'm sure that you fellows are familiar

780
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,640
with this distinction but just wanted to

781
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,039
point it out since temporality in these

782
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,080
models

783
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,159
and doing model selection

784
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,760
on different forms of temporality

785
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
is going to be an essential piece of the

786
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,679
puzzle

787
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,039
yeah and it also reminds me of

788
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,600
the shankarian analysis theory

789
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
that if you remember

790
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,799
we talked about

791
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,240
uh earlier

792
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,919
uh and it's hierarchical i mean i mean

793
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,320
it's temporal hierarchy that

794
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
um

795
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,799
it tries to describe the whole musical

796
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,159
piece uh as a kind of hierarchical

797
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,279
layers

798
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,320
which i think maps perfectly into this

799
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,279
exam specific example of

800
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,200
language parsing

801
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
because that

802
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,720
also is a kind of thing that

803
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,279
should ideally

804
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,600
be modeled in a very

805
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
hierarchical way but the caveat here is

806
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
unlike language

807
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,559
which is

808
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,279
at least in some languages

809
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,559
are

810
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,720
necessarily hierarchical

811
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,159
music is

812
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,799
at least tonal music or

813
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,720
even non-tonal music

814
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
are not

815
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,480
necessarily

816
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
they don't necessarily have this

817
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,799
hierarchical structure so depending on

818
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,399
the kind of music or the genre of music

819
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,120
we might have uh either

820
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,000
a very shallow and non-hierarchical

821
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,559
structure or a very deep one

822
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,279
so uh that's something

823
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,039
that uh

824
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,240
i think

825
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,279
again refers back to uh the kind of

826
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,200
system we're trying to

827
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
model but even

828
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,919
that kind of system needs to be

829
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,760
more um

830
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,559
i mean

831
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,720
specified in a more granular

832
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,399
level

833
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,000
in order to have

834
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
an effective

835
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
modeling strategy there

836
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
thanks for bringing in that domain like

837
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
it makes me think of

838
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,600
[Music]

839
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
the intro the chorus the bridge the

840
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
verse

841
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,519
perhaps these are only in certain genre

842
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
of music but analogously and then the

843
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,559
measure transcends any beat in the

844
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,679
measure

845
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,600
with a special case of like a one one

846
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
time signature or something

847
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,960
and so on

848
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
and then

849
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,399
although language is described in a

850
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,640
strictly hierarchical sense

851
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,320
i'm wondering how syntax and grammar

852
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,880
actually create kind of a strange loop

853
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,360
for example it's trivial to say that

854
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
phonemes are nested within words and

855
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,880
sentences and so on

856
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,679
but what about the semantics of a

857
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,320
sentence that contains commas

858
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
and exceptions and then at the end the

859
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
speaker says the previous sentence is

860
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,760
not how you think it is

861
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
that

862
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,279
is also causing kind of like a deep

863
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,080
linguistic recall

864
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,760
that

865
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
can be trivially modeled as containing

866
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,359
nested units

867
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,918
but will a model

868
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,320
that narrowly considers

869
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,239
the semantics of words than the

870
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,719
semantics of clauses

871
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,480
how will it be able to address some of

872
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,719
these questions

873
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,960
here i think we can point to a really

874
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,879
excellent

875
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,639
attribute of the active inference

876
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,639
modeling framework

877
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,599
so

878
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,399
um

879
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,000
in this discussion where the lw paper

880
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,560
was cited

881
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,239
we could

882
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,599
just

883
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,679
marvel at nested systems and draw

884
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,239
blankets on blankets and so on and they

885
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,159
can be drawn around every organelle and

886
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,000
every little lipid granule in the

887
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
neurons and

888
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
or the brain regions and so

889
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,839
we discussed a little earlier like doing

890
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,680
structural model selection on which one

891
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
of those are relevant

892
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
however this does not mean we need to

893
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,079
attempt to model the entire brain to

894
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,680
develop meaningful

895
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,520
pragmatic

896
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,480
simulations of a single level

897
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,079
for example if we wanted to focus on

898
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,760
word processing we could address some

899
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,200
aspects without having to deal with

900
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,240
phoneme processes

901
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,240
this means we can treat inputs from

902
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,680
parts of the brain drawing inference

903
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,079
about phonemes as providing observations

904
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,839
from the perspective of word processing

905
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,760
areas so one could say i'm going to make

906
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,640
a figure 4.3

907
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
where s is the true word

908
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,560
and phonemes are being passed as

909
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,320
observations

910
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
to my word inference engine

911
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,920
and someone can say but aren't phonemes

912
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,599
the result of inference and someone can

913
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,280
say great

914
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,200
make that module

915
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,079
in block friends make that module

916
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,040
and pass me that data

917
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,280
and then we can do a nested model and we

918
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,160
can graft those models together

919
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,680
but

920
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,079
through the mark all blanket formalism

921
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,000
not even the whole markov blanket

922
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
bounding a specific particular entity

923
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
but just the trivial markov blanket that

924
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,000
exists insulating any two unconnected

925
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,320
nodes in a base graph

926
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,400
we can use that

927
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,520
broader

928
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,599
still technical concept of a markov

929
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,560
blanket

930
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,240
and just say all right

931
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,720
phoneme observations come in

932
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,760
and surely we could make a model where

933
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,920
another type of information comes in and

934
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,520
the inference is on phoneme and that's

935
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,200
what's passed out

936
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
so i

937
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,040
think again to point to this advantage

938
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,000
of active inference modeling

939
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,119
it allows us to

940
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,000
situate phenomena as complex multi-scale

941
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
nested systems

942
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,279
and also

943
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,960
bite off what we can chew

944
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,760
and makes it an empirical question

945
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,240
of how grafting together which different

946
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,359
structures might be useful

947
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,520
but we don't need to um

948
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,160
go all the way like turtles all the way

949
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,680
down

950
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
we can just say it's even if it were

951
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,119
turtles all the way down

952
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,720
we're modeling the third through the

953
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
fifth turtle

954
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
and the fifth turtle gets a top down

955
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,599
prior

956
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,920
and the third turtle gets sensory input

957
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,000
from one below it

958
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,320
and that's the part of the stack and

959
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,160
this is the lateral width

960
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,040
that we're modeling

961
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,800
another advantage of active inference

962
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,839
which not even saying this is a unique

963
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,839
advantage is that this goal directedness

964
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,640
and corollary capacities like

965
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
counter factuals on goals and the way

966
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,119
that counterfactuals on world states

967
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,599
influence our goal selection

968
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,000
nested goals

969
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
and transient goals or conditional goals

970
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,160
can be resolved

971
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,640
in an unfolding action perception loop

972
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,480
that's something that as this example

973
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,800
of like

974
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,520
wanting to enter an apartment

975
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,400
of being goal driven

976
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
over multiple time skills

977
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,119
and then being able to again zoom in so

978
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,119
it's like oh grab the keys okay well

979
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,720
here's the key grabbing module and

980
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,240
someone says well the key grabbing is

981
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,079
actually um accomplished through this

982
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,680
kind of grasping behavior

983
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,560
then that could be modeled or you can

984
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,440
just say we're subsuming

985
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,320
finger grasping kinetics

986
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,160
in the grasping module

987
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,520
because the phenomena that we're trying

988
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
to explain

989
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
and the data we have is just about when

990
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
things were grasped

991
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,800
or maybe the only observations we have

992
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,680
is when apartments were entered

993
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,319
so we can actually i expect

994
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,839
frame

995
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,520
systems extremely expansively

996
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,079
and clarify where we're doing formal

997
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,079
modeling

998
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,200
i think

999
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,160
maybe this is just a philosophical or

1000
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,640
ontological framing of it but i'm

1001
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,118
i don't see how you can model anything

1002
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
well

1003
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,599
without

1004
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,720
admitting

1005
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,040
that it is either

1006
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,880
you know incomplete

1007
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,040
or

1008
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,240
partially consistent or

1009
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,640
you know um but there is some hidden

1010
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
state

1011
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,599
which is probably not included in the

1012
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,200
model

1013
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,240
and to me active inference

1014
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,720
kind of natively uh

1015
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,480
has an affordance

1016
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,320
at least at the very least a bookmark to

1017
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,599
do that

1018
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,440
um

1019
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,200
and so

1020
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
whatever

1021
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,079
depth or hierarchy you model the system

1022
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,320
um

1023
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,680
it's okay

1024
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,280
it's okay that there's still hidden

1025
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,079
state and it's incomplete um if you know

1026
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,240
if it sufficiently models answers the

1027
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,920
question at hand then you can always

1028
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
add another layer

1029
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,079
or you know make the model more complex

1030
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,040
and

1031
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,320
that's just what we were going to do

1032
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,800
anyways

1033
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,480
nice

1034
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,720
comment i totally agree with that

1035
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,119
again thinking back to the linear model

1036
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,720
example

1037
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,160
um

1038
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,880
where is that extra information

1039
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,240
about like

1040
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,960
um adjacent possibles for the model

1041
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,119
it's unstructured

1042
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
it's kind of like

1043
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,040
either the structured information is

1044
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,680
going to enter your linear regression

1045
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,599
just so

1046
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,040
and everything that's outside of your

1047
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,800
linear regression

1048
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
is um we're going to need to go back to

1049
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
the square one

1050
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,560
if we if we include a second observable

1051
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,079
we're going to have to go to square one

1052
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,599
and do the model selection all over

1053
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,200
again and test for all the repeat

1054
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,880
interactions again

1055
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,440
um but in these multi-scale models that

1056
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,040
we're discussing like you you said it

1057
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,480
was a bookmark it's kind of a nice way

1058
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,599
to

1059
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,200
um frame it which is like the phonemes

1060
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,920
you're bookmarking or

1061
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
leaving an open usb port or something

1062
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,760
any

1063
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,720
thing that outputs a phoneme

1064
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,720
will plug into that part of the model

1065
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,400
anything

1066
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
that

1067
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,160
is able to hear

1068
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,240
can be plugged in

1069
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,720
to the frog riveting

1070
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,480
anything that can see

1071
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,040
can be plugged into the visual

1072
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,599
component of the frog

1073
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,720
and so

1074
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,800
it's almost like

1075
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,560
consistent with all of this

1076
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,720
blanket talk

1077
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,560
we're being clear about what is modeled

1078
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
formally

1079
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,680
and the borders

1080
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,000
of the formal model

1081
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,880
are degrees of freedom

1082
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
as formulated

1083
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,760
to be

1084
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,680
expanded upon

1085
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,399
and composed

1086
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,800
one other

1087
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,560
um

1088
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
i'm not sure the context uh it's

1089
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,440
something or ben ben gertz will say

1090
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,720
attributed to um

1091
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
pinch right but um

1092
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,760
um that in circular mo um

1093
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
circular reasoning

1094
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,280
when your circle gets big enough it

1095
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,480
becomes coherent

1096
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
um

1097
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
maybe another way of saying like that if

1098
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,440
your model is insufficient

1099
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,280
um

1100
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,400
that if you

1101
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,640
you know

1102
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,480
add enough

1103
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,720
states enough you know if you expand

1104
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,200
your blanket enough eventually

1105
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,720
if you're modeling something correctly i

1106
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,520
guess uh you know it can

1107
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,520
the general process can can

1108
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,280
did match blanket states can can come

1109
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,240
into

1110
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,640
the line

1111
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,000
nice

1112
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,520
um some more active inference isms

1113
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,000
so exteroceptive proprioceptive and

1114
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,560
terraceptive

1115
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
we're going to use active inference

1116
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,240
modeling

1117
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,200
memory attention anticipation planning

1118
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,560
as inference

1119
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,760
we're going to use active inference

1120
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,880
that is what it looks like to integrate

1121
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,359
disparate fields using one model

1122
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,760
one family of models

1123
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,640
so you know

1124
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,000
others can work out some uh

1125
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,079
fun ways to

1126
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,880
communicate and frame it

1127
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
but i think when people are like like

1128
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,920
how is this simplifying when

1129
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,160
it might feel like it's bringing in a

1130
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,440
lot

1131
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,920
or even stepping on namespaces that

1132
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,000
people already have familiarity in like

1133
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,560
we discussed earlier

1134
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
you could ask how is memory related to

1135
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,000
attention

1136
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,440
or perhaps more saliently how will you

1137
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,680
model how memory is related to attention

1138
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,200
are you going to go on archive and just

1139
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,160
look for neural network architectures

1140
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,960
are you going to read

1141
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,640
a book written before computers were

1142
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,480
invented

1143
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,599
and look at prose

1144
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,200
are you going to dive into the

1145
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,720
psychoanalytic tradition

1146
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,240
or something that's maybe even

1147
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,520
clinically biomedical

1148
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,920
what's the move

1149
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,839
and active inference addresses that

1150
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,839
in these

1151
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,599
um uh

1152
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,800
theme of

1153
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,400
where's the people used that mean

1154
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,599
different things

1155
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,520
for four hundred

1156
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,040
we have

1157
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,480
bayes optimal behavior

1158
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,240
well then why do things go wrong

1159
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,200
and there's multiple layers to unpack

1160
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,079
first is going wrong

1161
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,839
is about your

1162
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,160
perspective on how the system perhaps

1163
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,400
how you prefer it to be or how you

1164
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,160
expected it to be

1165
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,920
but like given where

1166
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,520
you put the

1167
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,800
dish

1168
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,560
when it fell off the table

1169
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,680
that was just compatible with gravity

1170
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,240
so it was finding its optimal position

1171
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,920
and fragmentation

1172
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,800
where you placed it

1173
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,880
the ball rolled downhill

1174
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,280
as a consequence of where it was placed

1175
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,079
and the slope it was on

1176
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,760
and

1177
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,079
framing behavior

1178
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,800
in that light

1179
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,119
we're modeling behavior as rolling to

1180
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,160
the bottom of a bowl

1181
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,920
what's the bowl what's the ball those

1182
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,839
are the questions

1183
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,119
but it's like chemical reactions

1184
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,440
proceeding under gibbs free energy

1185
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,359
minimization

1186
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,000
when we have policy selection

1187
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,680
driven by

1188
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,920
variational and expected free energy

1189
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,640
minimization

1190
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,680
but how can things that go wrong be

1191
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,160
optimal

1192
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,599
well

1193
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,119
it has to do with

1194
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,440
different parameters in the model

1195
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,839
given how they are

1196
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,880
the model performs optimally

1197
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,319
that doesn't mean computationally

1198
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,599
efficiently

1199
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,800
it doesn't mean adequately

1200
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,160
doesn't mean it satisfies

1201
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,640
but it may be framed as bayes optimal

1202
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,079
fixed

1203
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,200
and learned behaviors

1204
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
this is going to come into play

1205
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,119
in chapter seven

1206
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,119
there's an amazing continuity

1207
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,800
in theory and

1208
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
in simple examples

1209
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,960
with perception and learning

1210
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
which is to say that perception happens

1211
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,480
over faster time scales or perceptive

1212
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,319
like processes happen over faster time

1213
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,960
scales while learning like processes

1214
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,280
happen over slower time scales

1215
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,960
or even just

1216
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,040
more generally

1217
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,880
perception and learning refer to

1218
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,599
parametric update processes

1219
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,359
and you might even be able to situate

1220
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,839
the same example both ways like if we

1221
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,040
see a ball move across our visual field

1222
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
are we perceiving the location of the

1223
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,920
ball

1224
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,200
are we inferring the location of the

1225
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,240
ball or are we updating and learning

1226
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,160
our position of the ball

1227
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,520
for those with a computational

1228
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,000
background learning

1229
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,359
often equates to parameter updating

1230
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,599
and so in that sense any kind of

1231
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,680
dynamical perception is learning

1232
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,960
so

1233
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,040
for some backgrounds

1234
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
the difference between perception and

1235
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,880
learning

1236
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,559
will be seamless

1237
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,319
for other backgrounds

1238
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,680
those are going to sound like totally

1239
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,800
different processes i mean isn't

1240
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,079
perception when you see the book but

1241
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,480
then learning is like

1242
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,000
when you understand something about the

1243
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,480
book

1244
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,640
um

1245
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,800
and then speaking from a more

1246
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,760
modeling perspective here

1247
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,000
a fixed model

1248
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,280
or fixing a parameter of a model

1249
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,240
reduces the model's complexity immensely

1250
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,480
or another way to say it

1251
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,520
taking a fixed parameter and making it

1252
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,200
learnable

1253
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,359
introduces multiple

1254
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,400
hyper parameters

1255
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,480
and there's no single way

1256
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,760
to address parameter learning

1257
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,200
you could say well we're taking we're

1258
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
doing moving average learning like a

1259
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,839
column filter or just a simple sliding

1260
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,839
window we're taking the average of the

1261
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,119
last three

1262
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,720
but now you have to parameter sweep

1263
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,480
across how many

1264
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,920
and with a single trial of data

1265
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,280
there may be um

1266
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,440
it may not be clear

1267
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,400
which learning strategy is implemented

1268
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,599
because especially if we want to

1269
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,839
differentiate learning strategies

1270
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,599
empirically

1271
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,960
we would want to see like multiple

1272
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,160
comparable trajectories

1273
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,760
within and amongst individuals

1274
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,800
in similar and different contexts

1275
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,240
but now

1276
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,599
you know our lab has gotten quite big

1277
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,559
and we're doing quite large model

1278
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,720
selections

1279
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,279
even for

1280
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,440
learning and updating

1281
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
parameters that might just

1282
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,440
conversationally seem really simple

1283
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,640
like preferences being updated

1284
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,400
so here's

1285
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,000
this description of when it comes to

1286
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,319
inference and perception as being fast

1287
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,280
changes and learning as slower changes

1288
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,440
though they're being modeled in a really

1289
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,319
analogous way

1290
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,559
it is worth noting in this book we

1291
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,400
exemplify rather simple generative

1292
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,079
models that are defined using tabular

1293
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,960
methods eg with explicit matrices or

1294
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,760
tensors for priors and likelihoods

1295
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,119
in small state spaces

1296
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,040
in comparison more sophisticated gms

1297
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,119
are being developed in machine learning

1298
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,280
deep learning robotics etc

1299
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,880
so is active inference deep learning

1300
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,880
okay

1301
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,040
good fellow generative adversarial

1302
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,599
networks

1303
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,280
but

1304
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,920
with uh bengio

1305
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,000
and mirza but

1306
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,319
are we saying those are formally active

1307
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,520
inference systems

1308
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,800
or are we just saying that

1309
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,119
we can

1310
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,839
think of it like birdsong conceptually

1311
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,599
and then are we just

1312
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,160
adding a rapper or a descriptor to the

1313
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,599
gans

1314
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,520
that our non-active colleagues are

1315
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,440
building

1316
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,520
is it shining any new epistemic or

1317
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,119
pragmatic light on gans

1318
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,240
i mean here's a whole paragraph on gans

1319
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,520
home is behind

1320
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,079
oh that's chapter 10. it's like what

1321
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,240
happened

1322
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,599
but there's still a whole paragraph on

1323
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,920
gans

1324
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,920
did you see that

1325
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,240
how did that happen

1326
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,439
whoa

1327
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,920
i'm not sure what the optimal way to

1328
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,119
view a pdf is or that one exists but

1329
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,200
i don't think it's a browser

1330
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,599
it's not bad but it's not

1331
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,480
not optimal um

1332
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,200
yeah yeah i don't i would i interested

1333
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,400
in that you know

1334
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,599
this

1335
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,920
again the generative model

1336
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,680
oh i know what those are so general

1337
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,400
model like um and how you know specific

1338
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,760
specifically

1339
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,400
gans here and active inference like is

1340
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,240
one

1341
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,680
is the

1342
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,599
rectangle a square

1343
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,520
uh sorry square rectangle rectangle not

1344
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,200
a square here is that you know what

1345
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
we're is being said or is there a

1346
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,880
you know

1347
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,240
uh

1348
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,599
yeah

1349
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,599
degreed uh a um indexed blanket here of

1350
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,000
a varying degree

1351
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,640
um yep

1352
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,119
yep

1353
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,920
as far as i know and also you

1354
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,200
fellows might know like

1355
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,359
this is being pointed to

1356
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,400
variational auto encoders

1357
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,480
and variational bayesian inference

1358
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,839
are directly implicated

1359
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,400
as potentially recursive cortical

1360
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,680
networks are

1361
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,720
and world models

1362
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,240
but

1363
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,839
if these bridges can be made

1364
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,480
solid

1365
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,520
like you said with squares and

1366
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,880
rectangles

1367
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,079
so that we can say all sum or none

1368
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:12,960
of

1369
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,800
x are y

1370
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,520
or here's how you project this model to

1371
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,839
that

1372
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,839
model it's going to just

1373
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:22,800
like

1374
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,520
break a dam

1375
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,759
with

1376
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,760
possibly certain applications of active

1377
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,040
any final comments on six

1378
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,880
and uh i think

1379
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,240
certainly by um two weeks from now

1380
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,359
uh

1381
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,480
let's uh

1382
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,760
look at the spm

1383
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,359
implementation and look at some of those

1384
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,040
that are pointed towards in the book as

1385
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,640
well as some of like the epistemic

1386
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,000
chaining

1387
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,200
and um

1388
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,920
pi mdp type models as well as anything

1389
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,400
that anyone else builds so any final

1390
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,200
comments

1391
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,240
uh yeah i just wanted to point out uh

1392
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,599
the recent

1393
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,720
work by uh feels at all especially

1394
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,319
uh one

1395
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,119
the two papers that

1396
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,640
person was also

1397
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,319
as a co-author

1398
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,839
uh is

1399
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,160
one of the their main objectives is to

1400
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,480
cross uh that bridge between active

1401
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,240
inference and bae

1402
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,359
uh via the cccd system so

1403
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,400
uh that

1404
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,640
bridge they're talking about in this

1405
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,000
book is already been investigated uh to

1406
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,160
be uh filled so

1407
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,599
yeah they're

1408
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,319
uh pretty interesting developments going

1409
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,839
uh in that regard

1410
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,319
okay any last notes before i stopped

1411
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,000
recording

1412
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,799
what is that paper

1413
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,440
i'll send you the link from the discord

1414
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,040
i forgot

1415
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,280
um maybe just one

1416
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,240
i don't know

1417
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,359
uh

1418
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,040
we haven't

1419
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,280
tried to make a effort on the code to

1420
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,359
like um

1421
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,319
lay down some

1422
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,799
basic examples from one you know the

1423
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,319
first half but um should there be some

1424
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,558
um

1425
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,280
if we're gonna model stuff is should we

1426
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,240
um

1427
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,200
have a

1428
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,599
subpage for that or do put something

1429
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,359
somewhere in the coda for that i don't

1430
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,079
know

1431
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,760
we've had this code section from the

1432
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,200
beginning

1433
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,799
yeah and just

1434
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:33,760
however

1435
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,359
it should be totally modifiable

1436
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,960
full control so

1437
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,599
however this and anything subpages need

1438
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,040
to be modified

1439
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,839
and the github link

1440
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:46,960
to

1441
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,520
a textbook

1442
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,240
anything that people suggest just let us

1443
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,240
know

1444
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,440
anything else

1445
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,559
okay
