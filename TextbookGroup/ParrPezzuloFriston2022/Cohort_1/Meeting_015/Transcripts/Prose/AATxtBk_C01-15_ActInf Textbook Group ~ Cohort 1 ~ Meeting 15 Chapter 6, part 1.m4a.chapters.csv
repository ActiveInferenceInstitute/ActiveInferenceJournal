810	39370	00:00	It is September 9, 2022. It's the 15th meeting for Cohort one. We're in the first of two discussions on chapter six of the textbook. Anyone is welcome to add more questions here.	Cohort one is discussing chapter six of the textbook	Cohort 1: Chapter 6
39440	423430	00:39	What are the four steps in the recipe to construct an active inference model? And can we make templates that facilitate people walking through some of these stages? Do people want to have one or more model that they're personally developing?	What are the four steps in the recipe to construct an active inference model	Active Inference: The Step by Step Guide
426990	755940	07:06	The four steps can be applied mostly to the how and the why. What models are mostly mostly descriptive models. When we want to model an agent and self evidencing agent, we have moved beyond just the descriptive stage. And this instills pluralism through action about how we're modeling a system.	On the topic of modeling, well, at a very basic level	4 Steps in Cognitive Modeling
758950	1096990	12:38	The particle is the internal and the active sensory states. Could we have the around the clock model external states influencing sensory, then internal, then active and without any cross talk in the blanket? Is that plausible? Does that change the formalism?	Figure 6.1 shows bi directional arrows between external and internal states	Bayesian Mechanics 6.1: Bi directional arrows
1097520	1364700	18:17	We're talking about agents and their interfacing with the niche. Are active states along the branch influencing the B matrix how the hidden states change through time? There may be a simple trail from this action perception loop framing to the discrete and continuous time POMDPs.	Another really important question is like this action perception loop is appealed to often	The action perception loop
1377670	1723410	22:57	How do we account for residuals and understand which modeling residuals are acceptable? What traces of data are we looking to explain variability in? What observations must we make?	How do we account for residuals when modeling climate models	The residuals of science
1727220	1981650	28:47	Figure 61: discrete and continuous, shallow, deep and hierarchical. Deep is describing how iterated the model is through time, within one type of time. Unlike language, which is necessarily hierarchical, music is at least tonal. Even that kind of system needs to be more specified in a more granular level.	Figure 61 describes discrete and continuous, shallow, deep and hierarchical models	Deep and shallow models of language
1982980	2751468	33:02	Active inference modeling allows us to situate phenomena as complex multiscale nested systems. This means we can treat inputs from parts of the brain drawing inference about phonemes as providing observations from the perspective of word processing areas.	Active inference modeling allows us to model complex multiscale nested systems	Inference with a Markov blanket
2751634	3403950	45:51	For 400, we have Bay's optimal behavior. Well, then why do things go wrong? And there's multiple layers to unpack. This is going to come into play in chapter seven. There's an amazing continuity in theory and in simple examples with perception and learning.	Gantz describes perception and learning as being fast changes and slower changes	Inference and Learning: The Bayesian framework
3406480	3484160	56:46	Should there be some basic examples from the first half? If we're going to model stuff, should we have a sub page for that? However, it should be totally modifiable, full control. Anything that people suggests, just let us know.	Should there be some examples in the code to model stuff	A few notes on the code
