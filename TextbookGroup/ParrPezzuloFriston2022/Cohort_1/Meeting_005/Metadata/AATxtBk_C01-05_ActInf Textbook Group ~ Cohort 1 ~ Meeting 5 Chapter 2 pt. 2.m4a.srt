00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,026
You. Hello everyone. It is June

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:07,438
2, 2022 and we're in week five

3
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:10,986
of textbook group cohort one. We're

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:13,914
having our second discussion on chapter

5
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:17,374
two and we will

6
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:20,526
get right to the questions. First, just

7
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:22,590
wanted to highlight the Math learning

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,806
group, especially for those who are not

9
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:28,550
regularly attending the meetings yet.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,566
The meetings are on 19 UTC on

11
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:32,840
Wednesdays. But just with everything,

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,066
don't let the synchronous time dissuade

13
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:38,134
you. We can set up other synchronous

14
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:41,082
times if people want to cowork. And also

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,226
the resources and the modifications are

16
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:45,834
all asynchronous. So we've been doing

17
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:48,170
several things in the Math learning

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,982
group. First, we've been sharing

19
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:53,206
important resources and categorizing

20
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:56,158
them. So if somebody wants to look at a

21
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,046
video on something or find a textbook on

22
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,182
something, or if you come across

23
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:02,366
something useful, just add it here. And

24
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:05,246
then if you feel like leveraging the

25
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:06,946
resources that you or other people have

26
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,946
added, then you can categorize it in the

27
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,866
table and just add a few pieces of

28
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:13,582
information on it. We have a notation

29
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:15,106
table that we'll be building,

30
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,074
especially as we get into the continuous

31
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:19,910
time active inference. We have some

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,646
questions, less so questions about the

33
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,314
textbook and more so, just cool math

34
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:27,494
questions that people are raising as

35
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,850
they're discussing the material.

36
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,014
And then we're building a math oriented

37
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:35,686
overview. So we've gotten up to equation

38
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:39,386
2.5 in chapter two and this is just

39
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:40,986
sort of like point by point, like what

40
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,558
are the formalisms doing? Where are the

41
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,286
figures coming into play? How are some

42
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:47,502
things related? And any and

43
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:50,366
all note taking can be added. You can

44
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,766
always add it to like unsorted notes or

45
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:55,566
erota and then we can categorize it

46
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:57,826
later. But this is how we develop a

47
00:01:57,848 --> 00:02:00,254
shared epistemic resource that's useful

48
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,338
for everyone. And we're going to come to

49
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:03,826
this in the questions. So we won't go

50
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:07,782
into detail right now, but equation 2.5

51
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,566
is the variational free energy. 2.6 is

52
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,478
about expected free energy, the G, and

53
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:15,606
this is a key equation and set of

54
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:20,170
equations. So yesterday with Blue,

55
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,522
Brock, Jessica Jakub, we went

56
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:27,994
through and line by line we went with

57
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:30,890
examples, natural language readings,

58
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,494
questions, interpretations, and then

59
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:37,934
Yaakob added some derivations. Like how

60
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:40,078
are those three lines in 2.5 related to

61
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:42,030
each other? How do we go from the energy

62
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,562
and entropy formulation to the

63
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:47,150
complexity accuracy formulation?

64
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,686
So this is the essence of understanding

65
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,682
the equations. It's an infinite learning

66
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:56,150
journey for everyone. So whatever level,

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,040
whether you want to. Be.

68
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,506
Catching up to what has been written

69
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:03,446
here, or whether you see ways to

70
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,830
reorganize it and go beyond and add more

71
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,114
connections, every single background and

72
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:11,334
level of math familiarity can contribute

73
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:13,306
in this way. But we'll come to the more

74
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,260
details on 2.5 in the questions.

75
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,486
Any just preliminary thoughts

76
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,734
that people would like to share? They

77
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,630
can raise their hand or write in the

78
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,086
chat at any time. Is there anything that

79
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,702
anybody wants to share before we start

80
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,862
going through the questions, starting

81
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,466
with the most upvoted ones that we

82
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,926
haven't addressed, but we'll just pause

83
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,966
for a few seconds. Tune into the chapter

84
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:42,754
two regime of attention upvote any

85
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,434
questions that you'd like to see

86
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,030
addressed? Post anything in the chat?

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,396
Yes, Jose? Yeah, I'd like to

88
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:59,336
ask if there's a recording of the math

89
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:02,670
sessions which you had. No,

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,536
we record Stick mergically with the

91
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,696
traces in the notes and we had this

92
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,216
conversation like about whether it

93
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:12,260
should be recorded or et cetera. If

94
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,804
there's enough desire, we could do

95
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:16,516
something like have some unrecorded and

96
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,676
some recorded. This session is obviously

97
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:22,628
recorded and rewatchable here and

98
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:25,348
we do many live streams and there is a

99
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:27,688
lot of recorded material. And so we want

100
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:29,384
to also hold a space for people who

101
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,448
don't want to speak on a recorded

102
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,836
version, even though everything's

103
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,076
recorded in universe and in each other's

104
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,424
minds. But yes, if there's enough

105
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:39,980
interest in people who want to record

106
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,510
sessions, we absolutely will do it.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,276
We also just wanted to make sure that

108
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:47,612
there was a total open math learning

109
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,664
space where people wouldn't even have

110
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:53,136
that cross their horizon. But we did

111
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:54,400
discuss that yesterday.

112
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,400
Thank you. Yeah. Any other comments?

113
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,832
People can just raise their hand with

114
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:07,524
six in gather or right in the chat. So

115
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,836
we're going to just go

116
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,476
to the questions and there's still time

117
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,632
to upvote, like during the discussions

118
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:19,560
and we're just going to upvote the ones

119
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,196
once we've discussed them. So we'll

120
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,256
start with the first question that we

121
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:26,730
haven't discussed yet.

122
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,830
Okay, this is from page 32.

123
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,364
Policy dependent outcomes are not

124
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,076
immediately available, but they can be

125
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,584
predicted by chaining together two

126
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,536
components of the generative model. The

127
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,444
first is our beliefs about how hidden

128
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:45,970
states change their time.

129
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,932
Just want to find what the second part

130
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:55,590
was.

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,464
The second component is the likelihood

132
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:03,300
distribution.

133
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,614
What really changes as a result of

134
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:15,942
policy selection, the hidden states or

135
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:19,090
the outcomes? Bringing a jacket

136
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,438
doesn't necessarily change the

137
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:21,802
temperature hidden state but instead

138
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:23,626
changes my observation perception of

139
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,914
whether it's cold or not. Can we

140
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,226
actually change hidden states with

141
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:28,618
policy selection? And what would be an

142
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:29,660
example of this?

143
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,726
Does anyone want to raise their hand and

144
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,926
give a thought on this question?

145
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,182
What really changes as a result of

146
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,038
policy selection? The hidden states are

147
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:45,794
the outcomes while

148
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:47,794
people are raising their hand. I'll give

149
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:51,170
one possible thought. The answer is both

150
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,614
slash. It depends. So bringing a jacket

151
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:55,678
does change the temperature around you.

152
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:57,666
It's not just changing your perception

153
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,502
of temperature. So one example of

154
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,814
changing a hidden state with

155
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:05,282
temperature, hidden state of temperature

156
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,526
with policy selection would be like

157
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,798
changing the setting on the thermostat

158
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:12,134
that is intervening into the causal

159
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,006
process, the generative process that's

160
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,106
giving rise to temperature, which is

161
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,866
giving rise to your perceptions of

162
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,874
temperature. And so assuming that your

163
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,182
temperature perception is accurate, you

164
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,922
are able to change both the temperature

165
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,862
in the room or the temperature around

166
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,350
you with the jacket. And thus because

167
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,334
temperatures are giving rise to

168
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:34,994
observations of temperature, also you

169
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,170
end up changing both blue.

170
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,950
So this is my question and I think Karl

171
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,418
kind of possibly started to answer it on

172
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,942
the live stream yesterday. I need to

173
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,518
think about it more and unpack it a

174
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:54,054
little bit more. But we change

175
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,102
the temperature around ourselves, but

176
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,366
we're not going to change the

177
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,226
thermometer reading by bringing a

178
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,300
jacket. Right,

179
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,786
but anyway, what Karl said and what

180
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:07,274
might be beneficial for others to hear

181
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:11,014
is that when you think about what's

182
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,586
changing, it's like really, when you

183
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,206
think about a hidden state, there's a

184
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,634
causal chain underlying that hidden

185
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,254
state. And the same thing, like when you

186
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,606
think about an observation, there's a

187
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,334
causal chain underlying that

188
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,638
observation. So like, no, I'm not going

189
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:26,306
to change what my eyes tell me the

190
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,506
temperature is, but I'm going to change

191
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:28,926
what my body tells me the temperature

192
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,946
is. And so it depends because it's a

193
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,446
multisensory observation,

194
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,502
right? So which sense is going to change

195
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,926
not my visual reading on the

196
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,906
thermometer, but my physical perception

197
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:43,686
of cold. Also yesterday on the live

198
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,578
stream, thomas Parr and Karl Friston

199
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,274
joined So that was really awesome and a

200
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:51,946
great one to watch. 45.1 and we can

201
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:54,890
continue on this Ali and then Mike.

202
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,806
Yeah, I think that's what meant by the

203
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:05,438
word hidden in the statement because if

204
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:09,114
it was transparency observation

205
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,702
to any kind of perception or

206
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:14,306
observation, I don't think it would be

207
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,186
called a hidden state. I believe that

208
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,762
the reason it's called this, it's called

209
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:23,234
as such is because it's opaque to any

210
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,102
kind of perception or observation. So

211
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:29,474
it's kind of inherent to the universe

212
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:33,350
and probably not

213
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,462
amenable to any change

214
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:42,090
or action. Thanks Mike.

215
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,276
Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm thinking about

216
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:51,156
it the right way, but intuitively. I was

217
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:53,450
thinking that policy selection would

218
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,696
update the expected conditions or the

219
00:09:56,718 --> 00:10:00,276
expected state, so maybe adjusting

220
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,650
the priors in evasion sense.

221
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,588
Thanks. So we'll come to this later,

222
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,624
but the answer based upon the partially

223
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:11,756
observable Markov decision process,

224
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,380
discrete and continuous time versions,

225
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,584
policies pi intervene in between hidden

226
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,610
states and how they change their time.

227
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,616
Different hidden states, should they be

228
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:25,600
giving rise to different observations,

229
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,508
will result in different observations.

230
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,800
So changing the thermometer policy

231
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,024
selection is intervening in the causal

232
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,484
process of temperature changing through

233
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:37,652
time in the room hidden state. And if

234
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,444
the temperature in the room is

235
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,188
associated through the a matrix with

236
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,352
your observations of temperature, then

237
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:45,172
you will be changing your observations.

238
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:47,272
And then just like Mike said, that is

239
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:50,372
reflected based upon the expectations

240
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:52,776
that the individual has about the

241
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:55,944
observations of temperature. So they're

242
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,060
both changing because the hidden states

243
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,208
and the observations are linked. That's

244
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,550
what it means to have a generative model

245
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,832
or for there to be a partially

246
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:08,256
observable model with hidden states and

247
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,952
observables hierarchical models. A given

248
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,512
state could be in emission from a higher

249
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:17,456
state and emitting a lower state. And

250
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:18,912
that's kind of like how the current

251
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,860
moment is like a consequence of the

252
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,772
past, but it's a cause of the future.

253
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,072
So this is related to Bayesian modeling,

254
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:28,116
but using this architecture, we can say

255
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,980
that policy intervenes only in between

256
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,264
hidden states. We don't directly

257
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:35,860
intervene in how observations appear.

258
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,044
Any other thoughts or questions on this

259
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:43,670
question?

260
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,820
Okay.

261
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,440
All right.

262
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,970
In Figure 2.2 figure

263
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,432
2.2 they

264
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:19,048
write x, Star, and X. So that's going

265
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:21,284
to be generative process and generative

266
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,544
model. Latent variables. Hidden states

267
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:25,656
do not necessarily live in the same

268
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:28,456
space of measurement. It might be the

269
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:30,616
case that hidden states in the external

270
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:32,556
world take on values that lie outside

271
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:34,556
the space of explanations available to

272
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:37,468
the brain. Conversely, it might be that

273
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:38,776
the brain's explanations include

274
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,236
variables that do not exist in the

275
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:43,276
outside world. For example, the former

276
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:44,876
could be five dimensional and the latter

277
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:46,384
two dimensional. Or one could be

278
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,744
continuous and the other could be

279
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:51,036
categorical. So what are examples

280
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,356
people can think of where the

281
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:55,872
dimensionality of the generative

282
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:59,156
model, the cognitive entity, is the same

283
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,888
as the generative process, the niche

284
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,320
process giving rise to observations,

285
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,170
passing them to the generative model.

286
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,130
That's one question.

287
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,172
Second question how does this approach

288
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:16,948
or framing speak up to

289
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:21,032
the map territory debate hashtag,

290
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:22,860
instrumentalism and realism?

291
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,284
What papers or live streams best

292
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,776
characterize how active inference models

293
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,388
the action, cognition perception loop?

294
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:35,276
And what other possibilities or models

295
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,924
are there for the action, cognition

296
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,216
perception loop? What would be the

297
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,024
different strengths and limitations of

298
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,548
these different framings and

299
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,652
partitionings? Thanks, Joe. And then

300
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,184
Blue and then anyone else who raises

301
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:50,516
their hand. I was just

302
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,980
thinking a nice case where you could say

303
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,768
dimensionality is pretty obvious is

304
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:57,416
board games. If I was trying to

305
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,336
anticipate what my opponent is going to

306
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,650
play in a board game,

307
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,616
they have a limited number of possible

308
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,928
moves and I'm assuming I'm playing the

309
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,576
same game, I'm expecting them to make

310
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,636
some move on the same board. So me,

311
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,316
that sounds like the dimensionality is

312
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,824
the same because you're in this limited

313
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:18,376
world, I don't have to know what they're

314
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:19,516
thinking. I don't have to know what they

315
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:21,744
had for breakfast. I don't have to know

316
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,648
a lot of stuff. I'm just thinking, and I

317
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,840
might be wrong. What movement?

318
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,450
Great. Thanks for that.

319
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,288
So with the same dimensionality, it's

320
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:38,390
like if we're playing the same game,

321
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,616
then we're playing a game where we're

322
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,990
tracking a little cursor on the screen.

323
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,576
The movement space within that is just

324
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:49,384
the x and the y value or just two

325
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:54,664
dimensions. And so the

326
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:57,544
observation is like the location in two

327
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:00,728
dimensions, and then that is

328
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,236
the same dimensionality that inference

329
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:06,684
is occurring on. But as an I'm thinking

330
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:07,916
just to add a little bit to more of my

331
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,436
comment, if I wanted to enrich it and

332
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,876
say oh, but I'm starting to think

333
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:12,524
strategically and anticipating their

334
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,376
next move or anticipating maybe they're

335
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,608
bluffing or maybe I'm bluffing and I

336
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:17,948
want to see if they know that I'm

337
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:20,044
bluffing. We add more dimensionality.

338
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:22,496
And I guess in principle, again, you

339
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:26,084
could still add that dimensionality in

340
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:28,276
somehow in parity with parts of the

341
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,916
hidden states. You see what I mean?

342
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,196
That I'm thinking, oh, they think they

343
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:35,856
know I'm bluffing or I think they're

344
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,764
bluffing. You're talking again about the

345
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,528
same thing. You don't have to know what

346
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:40,696
they had for breakfast. You're just

347
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:41,848
talking about this extra information

348
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,960
which isn't in the board itself, but

349
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,370
that gets a bit more complicated. Yes,

350
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,964
thanks. So that

351
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,804
is a good answer. Other ones that people

352
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:01,344
have written thermostat is having

353
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,288
the same dimensionality, like it's a

354
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,636
temperature value, it's a dimensionality

355
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:09,420
of one. And so then the person's

356
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,040
generative model is also on this

357
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,716
one dimensional temperature axis. And

358
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,476
then they mentioned that it could be

359
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,512
like categorical versus continuous.

360
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:23,584
So without going too many rabbit holes

361
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,188
deep, we could just say temperature in

362
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,508
the room is a continuous variable. It's

363
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,048
like taking on a number. It could be a

364
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,688
decimal point number between any number,

365
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:33,560
zero to infinity.

366
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,864
The person's model might be the same

367
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:41,356
dimensionality like one. But then they

368
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:43,352
might be trying to make a categorical

369
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,296
estimate. Is this livable or unlivable?

370
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:49,196
Is it hot, neutral or cold? That'd be

371
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,200
like a three state categorical model.

372
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,464
So the generative process doesn't have

373
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:57,184
to have the same dimensionality or

374
00:16:57,302 --> 00:17:00,480
continuous versus discreteness of

375
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,090
the generative model.

376
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,536
Second answer for same dimensionality.

377
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:11,440
Controls for a car have two degrees

378
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,636
physical degrees of freedom the

379
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,116
acceleration, the speed, whether you can

380
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,536
hit the gas or the brake and the

381
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:20,308
direction of the front wheels controlled

382
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:23,796
by the steering wheel. So there's

383
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:26,212
like a speed dimension and then there's

384
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:29,276
a turning angle dimension. This is the

385
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,356
model that people use when controlling a

386
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:34,552
car at some level about abstraction.

387
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:37,404
And then the acceleration dimension can

388
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:41,228
be acted upon through policy

389
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:44,048
selections like stepping on the gas and

390
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,184
the brakes. And then it's like, well,

391
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:46,912
those are two categorically different

392
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,436
affordances and then there's continuous

393
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,820
variables inside of that categorical

394
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,764
difference. And we'll talk about like

395
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:56,436
hybrid control models with both

396
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,684
categorical and continuous aspects in

397
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:03,216
play. And in this case, the speed

398
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,348
of the car in the speed axis is the

399
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:08,264
hidden state. The observable would be

400
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:12,072
the speedometer. So again,

401
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,152
the gas and the brake are policy

402
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:17,188
selections that modify. Let's say we're

403
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:18,880
thinking about a train. No turning

404
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,460
policy selection is influencing

405
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,636
how speed changes through time. And if

406
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,440
you have a speedometer that's accurate,

407
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,536
even if it's noisy, it's giving rise to

408
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:32,464
observations reflecting those changes in

409
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:36,096
speed. But gas and brake do not change

410
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,156
the speedometer directly. They're

411
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,016
changing a hidden cause, which is the

412
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,000
speed different dimensionality

413
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,796
rain comes from clouds. Simple mental

414
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:48,384
model is that the darker the clouds,

415
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:51,652
the more there will be. That's a two

416
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,510
dimensional generative model.

417
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,800
So how much rain,

418
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,136
how dark the clouds? And this

419
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,924
also is going to speak to this map

420
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:06,584
territory. Someone could say, well,

421
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:08,424
there's the size of the cloud and

422
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:10,536
there's also the humidity. So that's

423
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,100
like maps with increasing amounts of

424
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,316
variables. So no one's denying the

425
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,716
territory of the actual chaos of the

426
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,944
cloud. It's just a question of how much

427
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,832
detail and what data we're actually

428
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:26,448
treating as observables. And what

429
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,544
sophistication is being taken with

430
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,944
unobserved variables with hidden states

431
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:33,764
which are modeled in the computer or on

432
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,664
paper, but they're not directly

433
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:38,596
observed, then the mental model can be

434
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:42,404
decomposed even more and then add

435
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,584
infinitem. On the reality side, the

436
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:50,170
actual generative process

437
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,388
for weather is including

438
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,524
all the butterflies. So that's a

439
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:02,584
cognitive model that is two dimensional.

440
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,856
In this case, how much rain is expected

441
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:07,436
and how dark is the cloud, that one

442
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,984
could make increasingly nuanced

443
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:12,492
cognitive models. But whatever cognitive

444
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:15,852
model is being proposed, the generative

445
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,676
process is something that's like totally

446
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,964
different. Cognitive model generative.

447
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,608
Model map generative process niche

448
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:27,476
territory. Plants do better when they

449
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,744
have water and fertilizer. Generative

450
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,604
mental Model leaf droopiness is a sign

451
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:33,636
of moisture, but leaf size and color are

452
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:36,644
signs for nutrients. So one could

453
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,824
imagine like a causal graph where

454
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,296
there's like moisture level is

455
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:43,556
unobserved, but it is emitting leaf

456
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,508
droopiness as a state. But we're

457
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:46,948
observing leaf droopiness and we're

458
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:49,832
using that to infer moisture, whereas

459
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,876
nutrient is an unobserved state to the

460
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,612
visual gardener. And then they're using

461
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,596
two dimensions, leaf size and color. So

462
00:20:57,618 --> 00:20:59,224
this is a three dimensional cognitive

463
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:01,696
model leaf droopiness, leaf size and

464
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,640
color are observables. And then there's

465
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,856
two unobserved cognitive states,

466
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,320
nutrients and moisture.

467
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,320
But whatever map gets constructed,

468
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,456
that's not the plant. Now, the gardener

469
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,168
might then want to take an informative

470
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:21,824
experiment being an optimal Bayesian

471
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:24,436
gardener, and then measure something,

472
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:27,556
take something that was an unobserved in

473
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,332
the initial model and then measure using

474
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:34,152
LiDAR, like using some sort of sensor to

475
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,104
understand. And then that would make

476
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:39,876
that data point an outcome related

477
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,008
through some a matrix, which we're going

478
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:44,284
to get to later of the hidden state

479
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:46,296
being like the true levels of copper.

480
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:47,900
And then if we have an accurate test,

481
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,788
we can start using the outcomes of the

482
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:52,012
observed levels of copper and start

483
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,320
flushing out our model that way. Joe.

484
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,016
I chucked in a comment below. I hope

485
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:02,976
it's showing up just that. The other

486
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:04,256
part of the question was asking about

487
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:07,504
the map territory debate.

488
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:09,716
And here's from the person who kind of

489
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:13,140
came up with that dichotomy in the way

490
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,676
we usually talk about it. He says that

491
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:15,988
the map and territory should have a

492
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:17,268
similar structure. And I think that's

493
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:19,176
really interesting to think about. If

494
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:21,690
I'm making again moves in a board game,

495
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,104
I might make a reduction of their

496
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:28,264
mental state. Maybe I'm playing against

497
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,184
a computer for example. So I don't know

498
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:31,676
that they have a mental state or maybe

499
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:34,956
I'm playing against a person I

500
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,556
happen to know as a beginner. So I know

501
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,476
they're likely to make naive mistakes or

502
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,580
whatever, something like that. But I was

503
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,728
just thinking like with regard to the

504
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:43,824
leaf droopiness thing, you could have

505
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,500
all kinds of really badly structured

506
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,570
models of plant health.

507
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,296
Maybe it relates to how recently you

508
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,816
watered it or something. Well, that

509
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:56,068
sounds good in general, but if it's a

510
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,524
cactus, maybe that's like a defeater to

511
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:02,996
your system. So the point being it

512
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,436
seemed interesting that your map should

513
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,508
maybe if it doesn't have exactly the

514
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:08,696
same dimensionality, should still be a

515
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:11,076
nice reduction of the thing you're

516
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:13,050
trying to model, whatever that means.

517
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,924
Thanks. One aspect

518
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:21,800
on this is evolution, natural selection,

519
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,004
dissipation in our world, sweeping off

520
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,836
the table entities that are failing to

521
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:31,088
at least be adequate. So in a

522
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:33,250
dissipative situation that we're in,

523
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,024
the map has to be at least good enough,

524
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:39,756
otherwise the entity will fail to exist.

525
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:43,524
So that sort of closes the loop and is

526
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,440
like we're seeing the persistent

527
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,276
entities that are acting good enough to

528
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:51,764
navigate. And it's just interesting like

529
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:55,644
how many the allegory of the cave

530
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:58,312
to the blind people and the elephant and

531
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:00,824
realism instrumentalism and we've had

532
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:03,976
many live streams on

533
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:07,320
this especially. Check out number 14 on

534
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,156
Mel Andrew's paper. The math is not the

535
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:12,604
territory. So this one sort of

536
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:15,324
explicitly jumps in right there and

537
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:18,524
tackles this issue with the FEP front

538
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:21,116
and center. So this is a great series of

539
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:24,172
live streams. The dot zeros are

540
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:26,656
background and context where we just go

541
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,944
over the paper in a small group, like

542
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:31,936
one person or two or three people and

543
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,128
then the dot one and the dot two. We

544
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:35,492
usually have more of an open

545
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:38,000
participatory discussion and the authors

546
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,844
sometimes to usually join. So

547
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,972
everybody's welcome to participate in

548
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:44,564
contributing to dot zeros as well as

549
00:24:44,602 --> 00:24:46,100
enjoying the dot one and the dot two.

550
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,296
But just so you know, when you're

551
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:50,584
looking in the live stream table, the

552
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,416
dot zero is a good one to watch first

553
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:55,336
because it has the background and

554
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:56,904
overview on the paper. But then like

555
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:59,610
yesterday in 45.1,

556
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,804
we had Friston and Par join to discuss

557
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,468
just so that people can navigate the

558
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:07,804
live streams a little better. So we can

559
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:11,070
continue asynchronously adding more

560
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,656
thoughts on like map territory and what

561
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:16,752
papers and live streams and what other

562
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,396
possibilities for the action perception

563
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:21,692
loop. But these are big fun areas.

564
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:22,896
But we're going to continue with the

565
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:26,996
questions on

566
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:28,980
the notion of surprise.

567
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,772
Is the agent's perception not only

568
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:36,072
affected by the influence of not only

569
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:37,796
its environment but also an agent's

570
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:41,144
peers? So perhaps to restate, how is an

571
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:43,464
agent's perception affected by its

572
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,944
direct perception and its assessment of

573
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:49,272
peers? So the agent's peers are updating

574
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:50,632
their beliefs in a collaborative

575
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:54,620
fashion. What would be the extent

576
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,144
of the update to an agent's generative

577
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:58,620
model of perception if the agent

578
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,796
witnesses the annihilation of one of its

579
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:03,550
peers. For example, something like this,

580
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,808
okay, will to be from bird box. Not

581
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:10,096
going to open any video links, but

582
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:12,204
perhaps we'll observe some annihilation

583
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:15,424
like some animal attacks one of the wild

584
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:17,284
beast on the right, but then the other

585
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:20,644
one learns. So this is a great

586
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:22,950
video. Definitely good to watch.

587
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,680
So far in the textbook and indeed for

588
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,376
the textbook it's focusing on just like

589
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:35,448
we saw in figure two two, it's like one

590
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:38,120
entity in the niche.

591
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,636
The niche can consist of others like me.

592
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,100
Other entities that I expect are similar

593
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,528
to myself in terms of like the coarse

594
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:49,612
grained cognitive architecture they have

595
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,156
or their preferences, their affordances.

596
00:26:52,188 --> 00:26:53,696
They're able to do similar things, they

597
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:55,440
want similar things. They have a similar

598
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,320
history to some extent.

599
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,672
So that is sometimes called

600
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:06,100
thinking through other minds. Ttom and

601
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,572
just to give one thought and then anyone

602
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,884
can raise their hand. If we were to

603
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:14,500
accurately observe another

604
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,728
peer taking some action and then failing

605
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,876
to exist, we're driving on the highway,

606
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:22,216
and then we observe somebody taking a

607
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:23,928
policy to go off the highway, and then

608
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,512
we see them fail to exist, we could use

609
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:31,310
that information to update our

610
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,484
beliefs about the consequences of the

611
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,260
action to drive off the highway.

612
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,250
So I believe it would be possible

613
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,048
to implement every variation of direct

614
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,412
perception, direct perception of peers

615
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:52,064
thinking through other minds, theory of

616
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:54,390
mind learning by example,

617
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,060
imitation, contrarianism.

618
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,500
Every phenomena could be modeled as just

619
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:06,024
has to be whatever the specific model

620
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:07,640
is actually about. Ali.

621
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,774
I have a related question about 2.5 and

622
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:18,986
2.6. Well, correct me if I'm

623
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:22,142
wrong, but I understand that these

624
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:27,374
equations describe

625
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,982
the behavior of a kind of rational

626
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,198
behavior or the kind of behavior of a

627
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:36,210
rational agent. Where does irrationality

628
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,086
comes into this? Or let

629
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:43,958
me put it this way can

630
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,810
irrationality be a parameter?

631
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,438
In order to qualify these two equations,

632
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:53,820
2.5 and 2.6, or seen

633
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,062
from the other side, can we use

634
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:01,406
these two equations to measure the

635
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:05,274
extent of rationality as a measurement

636
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:09,200
of rationality? Good question.

637
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,986
Here's one quote. And we'll come to

638
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,954
equation 2.5 and six as well because

639
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:14,980
those are important.

640
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,426
Distinguishing the generative model and

641
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:20,930
the generative process is really

642
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,462
important. That's the difference between

643
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:26,742
the entity and the niche. It's important

644
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,514
to distinguish them to contextualize

645
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,134
psychological claims about the

646
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:33,026
optimality of inference. To the extent

647
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:34,854
these claims are valid on a Bayesian

648
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:36,458
view is always contingent on the

649
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:39,926
organism's resource. So don't

650
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,474
want to step out too far. But

651
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:45,286
rationality and irrationality. It's

652
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:46,906
rational to believe in X. It is

653
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:48,702
irrational to believe in X is always

654
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,234
subjective. From that speaker's

655
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:53,806
perspective, given the priors and the

656
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:56,334
update rules, all there is is

657
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:58,126
rationality. Which is to say this is

658
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:00,434
just the Bayesian updating process. So

659
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:04,194
there are maladaptive priors ones that

660
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,638
trend towards dissolution of the entity.

661
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,702
But there aren't irrational priors.

662
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,306
There just is what it is and how it

663
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:13,062
updates. And then that could be

664
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:16,694
inadequate, it could be any

665
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,006
number of other things and these are

666
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,002
like getting into relatively complex

667
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:23,206
cognitive phenomena where there could be

668
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:26,330
like multiple layered models.

669
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,654
But I would say rationality

670
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:34,266
in the Bayes process is like the

671
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:36,246
cognition is Bayes optimal or modeled

672
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,470
with a Bayesian process. And then

673
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,406
sometimes the interaction of the

674
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,874
generative model and the generative

675
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:45,274
process as appropriately defined

676
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:48,478
specifically is going to result in what

677
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:49,520
it results in.

678
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,650
But we will come to 2.5 and 2.6.

679
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,930
Okay here. Suffice to say, yes, social

680
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,706
learning and collective behavior and

681
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:04,306
emergent outcomes at the group level is

682
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:05,470
something that's important. But we

683
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,126
haven't addressed it so far in the

684
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:09,846
textbook, and multi agent models are not

685
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,526
really addressed in the textbook that

686
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:12,726
much because there's so much to

687
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,146
understand about the kernel of the

688
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:18,474
perception cognition action loop that

689
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,394
even though it's so important for real

690
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:23,660
systems, it's not brought up.

691
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,370
Okay, wanting to go to the equation,

692
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,820
the dark room problem for many years,

693
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,890
many Papes firing back and forth.

694
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,520
But let's go to the equations for our

695
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,800
let me check the chat here. Yes,

696
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,110
variational free energy is minimized

697
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,778
through two different possible

698
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,234
approaches minimizing divergence of

699
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:11,046
Q and P, changing mind and maximizing

700
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,186
evidence, taking action, changing

701
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:15,722
perception. This is done based upon

702
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,760
prior and present information.

703
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,578
Equation 2.5 variational free energy to

704
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:29,794
plan best actions, generative models and

705
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:31,582
internal policies produce simulated

706
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:34,190
outcomes that can be used to estimate

707
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,098
expected free energy as the average of

708
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:38,130
the log probability of outcomes.

709
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,000
Equation 2.6 expected free energy

710
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,806
and there's other variants in the

711
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,694
context of planning, planning as

712
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:53,594
inference. Equation 2.6 provides a view

713
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:56,394
of EFE that establishes consistency in

714
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,470
measurement units of exploration,

715
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,894
exploitation. The relative balance

716
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:03,534
between these terms determines whether

717
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:05,742
behavior is predominantly explorative or

718
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:12,316
exploitative. 34 in

719
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,344
other words, dissolving the classic

720
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,456
explore exploit dilemma in behavioral

721
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:19,852
psychology. What causes

722
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,304
this balance to change? I e. What

723
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:25,568
controls this balance? Very important

724
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:27,250
and interesting question.

725
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,340
Perhaps we can come to equation 2.5

726
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,464
first and then we can come to equation

727
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,244
2.6. So where

728
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,824
we're going is the future. The future

729
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:45,560
has several sources of, in principle and

730
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,856
in practice uncertainty. Observations in

731
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:51,608
the future have not happened. Actions in

732
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,356
the future have not happened and the

733
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,596
causes of future outcomes and

734
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,788
hidden states actions as well as the

735
00:33:59,794 --> 00:34:02,380
generative processes endogenous changes

736
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,648
haven't occurred. So there are several

737
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:08,428
fundamental and in practice limitations

738
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:10,736
of the kind of precision that you can

739
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:14,636
get on the future. That's planning

740
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:18,064
as inference, it's prospective in

741
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:21,844
contrast and that's expected free

742
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:23,476
energy because it's about the free

743
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,430
energy of an expected future.

744
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,656
Variational free energy f expected

745
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:34,036
free energy is g variational

746
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,824
free energy F is in equation 2.5.

747
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:39,288
Variational free energy as the question

748
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:42,292
says, is based upon present and prior

749
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:45,404
information. So variational free energy

750
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:49,470
is like now casting and

751
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,020
verging into something kind of like

752
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,136
memory as inference. We're integrating

753
00:34:56,248 --> 00:35:00,028
the past in the sense of our priors

754
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:02,848
and the present incoming data point why?

755
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:06,512
And it's like a snapshot evaluation of

756
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:09,664
optimal perception in the purely sensory

757
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:13,380
case. And if we include action within

758
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,612
variational free energy, it's taking one

759
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:20,404
step optimal actions. But those are not

760
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:22,264
necessarily like the ones that's not

761
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,292
planning. That's just like snapshot

762
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:28,648
decision making. In contrast, 2.6 will

763
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:32,484
explicitly consider policies.

764
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:36,332
It is a function of policy pi and so

765
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,888
it is including planning as inference.

766
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:41,630
But first let's look at 2.5.

767
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,664
Yaakov or anyone else. Would you like to

768
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,770
just describe one pass?

769
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,840
What is equation 2.5 showing?

770
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,200
I guess if you mean like describing,

771
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,608
say, the first line or the lines in a

772
00:36:17,614 --> 00:36:23,896
bit more detail, essentially the

773
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:26,910
energy term is just the expectation of

774
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,396
the log of the joint probability of the

775
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:35,996
data and the observation. So I

776
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:38,780
don't understand quite why they changed

777
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,072
the notation from appendix B, but Y

778
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:46,144
would essentially be the S, I think,

779
00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:47,810
and X would be the O.

780
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,776
Yes, anyone could be taking more notes

781
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,788
on this, but Y is the observable data

782
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:01,656
and X is the hidden state in the POMDP

783
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:03,436
that we're going to be getting to later

784
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:07,280
x out there, the hidden state is S and

785
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,840
O are observations. So this is using

786
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,172
more of a regression familiar framework

787
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:17,236
and variable notation. But this could

788
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:20,912
also be written LNP of O comma

789
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:23,716
S observations and states that's the

790
00:37:23,738 --> 00:37:25,824
joint distribution. Joint distribution

791
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:27,936
with a comma conditional distributions

792
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:29,380
with a vertical pipe.

793
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,854
Yeah. And so we are also taking the

794
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:39,574
entropy term is only based on the

795
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:44,662
beliefs of our hidden states. So people

796
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:46,354
were saying before that the hidden

797
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:48,886
states are unobservable. The only thing

798
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:50,342
that we can say about the hidden states

799
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:54,360
are the beliefs about the hidden states.

800
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,902
I don't think that the hidden states X

801
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:01,600
can ever really appear on their own

802
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,574
because we always need to have some kind

803
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:08,554
of belief about them. And this was also

804
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:10,210
related to a discussion we were having

805
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,474
yesterday that's interesting that

806
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:16,866
they kind of switched between the

807
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:20,500
notation of entropy with H

808
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,246
as the functional and just the

809
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:30,120
pure expectation with the E,

810
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,282
because the actual definition of entropy

811
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:36,090
is the expectation of the negative log

812
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,946
of whatever is in is

813
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:43,786
the variable, which in this case is Q of

814
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:48,526
X. And that's actually how we get to

815
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:50,094
the other two expressions with

816
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:51,786
complexity and accuracy and divergence

817
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:55,134
and evidence. And there's also a link I

818
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:59,618
think might be wrong with to

819
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,442
theoretical physics where

820
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:07,042
free energy is essentially the kind of

821
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:10,066
cognitive statistical equivalent of the

822
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:13,746
Lagrangian, which is defined

823
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,474
as kinetic energy minus potential

824
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:18,310
energy. So we were discussing yesterday

825
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,542
what that means in terms of the energy

826
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:23,946
and entropy in this case, whether the

827
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:28,090
energy is perhaps kind of the immediate

828
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,634
cognitive kinetic energy and then the

829
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:36,070
entropy is like. The potential energy or

830
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,566
vice versa might be

831
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,360
going off on a tangent at this point.

832
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,022
Awesome. Let me just add in a few other

833
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:48,910
notes. The variables f

834
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,874
is a function. It's the variational free

835
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:54,626
energy function. The arguments that it

836
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:57,586
is taking in are Q. That's the

837
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,234
variational distribution that we

838
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,546
control. That's what makes it a

839
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:03,654
variational free energy. Q is the one

840
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,518
that we control. P is the actual

841
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,526
probability distribution out there. Y is

842
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:12,726
the data point. So we have on the left

843
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:15,514
side of the equation, variational free

844
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:19,306
energy is a function of Q and Y. On the

845
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:21,670
right side, we have three equal signs

846
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,530
and these are three values, three ways

847
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,566
to phrase this one function. In the

848
00:40:29,588 --> 00:40:33,294
bottom here, Yaakov has shown how this

849
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:36,878
energy minus entropy can result.

850
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:39,114
In the second line, complexity minus

851
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:41,582
accuracy, and in the third line,

852
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:44,354
divergence minus evidence. So that was

853
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:46,754
like one really interesting thing, is

854
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:49,378
it's not like this is how it is and this

855
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:50,978
is a transformation and then this is the

856
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:53,366
transformation. Even though in a sense

857
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:56,182
that was also true, it is also probably

858
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:59,394
helpful to think about this energy minus

859
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:02,086
entropy formalism for what it is, which

860
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:05,802
is the closest to a physics framing of

861
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:08,762
free energy. And then think about these

862
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:12,250
two more statistical ontology

863
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,774
ways of framing it, complexity minus

864
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:16,778
accuracy, which is like very commonly

865
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,702
brought up in the context of model

866
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:21,722
fitting and divergence minus evidence

867
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:24,782
also. And yeah,

868
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:27,166
great. So Blue, if that sounds like a

869
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:30,734
very helpful norm in the description,

870
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:33,026
we'll try to have like a description of

871
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:36,242
the equation. The first row says this,

872
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:39,906
this people can type it however they

873
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:42,482
want. And then of course, we can replace

874
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:48,280
terms that are in the ontology with

875
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,134
the special at sign. And that will

876
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:55,034
facilitate finding equations that

877
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:57,194
mention those terms and it will

878
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:59,670
facilitate translating these equations

879
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,554
and also the descriptions into different

880
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:04,522
languages, computer languages and human

881
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:07,854
languages. So then we can work on it in

882
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:11,006
this ontological space and then make

883
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,494
sure that it's accessible to different

884
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:16,030
languages. For example, then we

885
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,474
thought about this example of like a

886
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:22,990
ball and its location in a bowl.

887
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,386
So there's a true location of where it

888
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:29,954
is in the bowl X. And then there's an

889
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:32,678
observation of where we're observing the

890
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:36,578
ball to be. And this also speaks

891
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:39,526
to the quantum to classical handoff. If

892
00:42:39,628 --> 00:42:42,834
the bowl is a swimming pool and the ball

893
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:45,738
is a bowling ball, after enough time,

894
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,594
it's going to be at the bottom and not

895
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:50,870
moving. If the bowl

896
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,074
is like a molecular well and

897
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:58,078
the ball is like an electron or like one

898
00:42:58,164 --> 00:43:01,086
atom, then repeated measurement is going

899
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:03,614
to be entirely different. And as the

900
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:06,190
ball in the bowl become more massive,

901
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,070
it approaches like a classical limit.

902
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,586
Little hints at the continuity between

903
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:17,234
classical statistical and quantum and

904
00:43:17,272 --> 00:43:20,354
thermophysics. But we thought about this

905
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:24,614
ball being in the bowl. So we

906
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:27,574
looked at two different cases, which is

907
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:29,846
when the ball is being observed in the

908
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:32,086
bottom of the bowl, it's like,

909
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:35,378
given the generative model of the shape

910
00:43:35,394 --> 00:43:37,290
of the bowl and gravity,

911
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,362
which is like a potential energy

912
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:43,226
function, observing the ball at the

913
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,966
center of the bowl is, like, strictly

914
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,006
the most likely thing that could have

915
00:43:47,028 --> 00:43:49,246
happened. And then observing it up on a

916
00:43:49,268 --> 00:43:51,710
side is like a less likely observation.

917
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,030
Eric and then blue.

918
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,106
Yeah. So you mentioned that F is

919
00:44:03,128 --> 00:44:06,034
a function. And as they put it, it's a

920
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:08,402
function of a function, which is a

921
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:10,434
functional. So the way I think about

922
00:44:10,472 --> 00:44:13,506
this is that the function that it's a

923
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:16,486
function of is the Q. So the Q is a

924
00:44:16,508 --> 00:44:19,158
distribution over your beliefs. So I

925
00:44:19,164 --> 00:44:20,598
think of that as being a function that

926
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:21,846
you're trying to optimize. You're trying

927
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:24,874
to say, well, how do I adjust my

928
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,820
internal belief state the Q.

929
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,274
And that's what I'm optimizing in this

930
00:44:31,312 --> 00:44:33,158
equation. And the functional says that's

931
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:34,634
what I'm trying to optimize is that

932
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,526
function and distribution. And then it

933
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,360
breaks down into the two parts, which is

934
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,950
your generative Model P, which says

935
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,794
well, P says for any there's

936
00:44:46,842 --> 00:44:50,574
the joint probability of X. X is

937
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:54,474
the internal state variable

938
00:44:54,602 --> 00:44:56,426
that you have a distribution over that's

939
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:59,774
Q. And so how do your Observables and

940
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:02,566
your internal states go together? And

941
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:04,294
then you have the entropy term, which is

942
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:06,962
well, you want to have maximum

943
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:08,982
uncertainty so that if you're not

944
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,654
constrained by your observations, you

945
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:14,342
want to be as agnostic as possible about

946
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:16,646
what the possible values are of your

947
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:18,954
internal states or make that queue as

948
00:45:18,992 --> 00:45:22,410
flat as possible. As flat as possible

949
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,442
under the constraints of the

950
00:45:24,496 --> 00:45:26,234
observations going through your

951
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:28,618
generative Model P. So I guess that's

952
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:31,200
the way I talk through this first line.

953
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,134
Awesome. Thank you, eric blue and then

954
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:38,694
Brock. So, Eric, that was super helpful.

955
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:41,026
I've been since yesterday trying to

956
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:43,634
figure out what exactly is meant by Q.

957
00:45:43,752 --> 00:45:46,866
Here. I get later on we're going to talk

958
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:51,246
about Q as representing beliefs. But as

959
00:45:51,288 --> 00:45:53,666
it's given, as it's laid out in chapter

960
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:57,014
two, they don't actually define Q at

961
00:45:57,052 --> 00:46:00,422
all. So I

962
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:03,094
am having a hard time up here. They

963
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:06,394
describe it right before they get

964
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:09,386
into that box. They describe Q in

965
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:13,050
Section 2.6 as an approximate posterior.

966
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,570
So approximate posterior of what? And

967
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,966
should we denote Q as the function of

968
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:24,026
beliefs here? Even though it's

969
00:46:24,058 --> 00:46:25,786
like they're skipping ahead and looping

970
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:27,454
back at the same time? It seems like,

971
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:28,880
or feels like to. Me,

972
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,542
q is the variational distribution where

973
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:36,606
the form of the posterior has been

974
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:40,542
chosen. So exact bays using

975
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:42,902
matrix multiplication, basically, or

976
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:45,666
sampling based approaches to approximate

977
00:46:45,698 --> 00:46:48,114
Bayesian computation, like Monte Carlo,

978
00:46:48,162 --> 00:46:51,682
Markov chain, those try to recapitulate

979
00:46:51,746 --> 00:46:54,682
the actual form of P.

980
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:58,298
So if P is truly bimodal, then exact

981
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:00,634
Bayes or sampling based approaches would

982
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:03,318
try to reconstruct that distribution.

983
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:06,034
In contrast, the variational approach

984
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:08,186
gains tractability because you're

985
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:10,506
choosing a posterior, approximate

986
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:13,934
posterior, a Q of a form that you know

987
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:15,242
is going to have a tractable

988
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:17,742
optimization scheme and there's message

989
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:20,206
passing algorithms that can do it

990
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,738
computationally. So if you choose Q to

991
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:25,378
be a gaussian, then depending on how you

992
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,618
parameterize it, it's either going to be

993
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:29,598
seeking the mode and go to the hump

994
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,522
that's bigger and center around that

995
00:47:31,576 --> 00:47:33,986
with a variance, or it'll just spread

996
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,822
out a lot and go over and try to cover

997
00:47:36,876 --> 00:47:38,886
as much probability density as it can by

998
00:47:38,908 --> 00:47:42,006
covering both humps. Okay, so the

999
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:44,506
variation of free energy function F as a

1000
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,838
function of the function representing

1001
00:47:46,854 --> 00:47:49,210
the approximate posterior Q and the data

1002
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,470
Y is equal to the negative expectation

1003
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,866
of Q given the observations x times the

1004
00:47:55,888 --> 00:47:57,558
natural log of the probability of the

1005
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,550
joint distribution of the data and

1006
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,194
observations. Is that the English

1007
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:02,638
translation of that equation? I think I

1008
00:48:02,644 --> 00:48:04,720
got it finally, after. Like two days

1009
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,186
minus close, I would. Say one

1010
00:48:09,288 --> 00:48:10,770
thing I would say slightly different.

1011
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,938
It's the expectation over Q,

1012
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,700
not expectation of Q.

1013
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,066
We actually talked about that a little

1014
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:21,662
bit. Like here we had negative

1015
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:26,120
expectation over Q and yes.

1016
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,382
Okay, blue then. Brock yeah, sorry,

1017
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:34,022
the ontology terms don't match the terms

1018
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:35,866
that are given in the book. And I put in

1019
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:37,466
a request in the questions here. If we

1020
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:40,362
can append the ontology because they use

1021
00:48:40,496 --> 00:48:45,450
data is the same as observations.

1022
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,426
Those are different words, but they're

1023
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:53,806
similar. Yeah, there's a lot

1024
00:48:53,828 --> 00:48:57,038
of synonyms or synonymous use, and so

1025
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:59,706
I would hate to step on them. But also

1026
00:48:59,748 --> 00:49:02,866
the terms aren't in the ontology at

1027
00:49:02,888 --> 00:49:04,258
all. So maybe we should update the

1028
00:49:04,264 --> 00:49:07,282
ontology to reflect the terms. We will

1029
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:09,026
absolutely add terms into the

1030
00:49:09,048 --> 00:49:11,822
supplemental or eventually into the core

1031
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:15,174
terms if that's required. But just leave

1032
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:17,926
a comment or email activeinference at

1033
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:20,118
gmail to add terms to the ontology if

1034
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,538
there's a term that you want to tag

1035
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:24,410
that's not being tagged. Frock.

1036
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,694
I feel like you may have indirectly

1037
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:35,146
answered this just now, but in

1038
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:37,534
the math discussion yesterday, we were

1039
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:40,494
talking about specifically about the Q,

1040
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:43,360
the distribution of beliefs over there.

1041
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:49,822
If X is this uncertainty term,

1042
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:53,614
this hidden

1043
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:59,890
state, like, what what

1044
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,406
value could it possibly have? Where is

1045
00:50:02,428 --> 00:50:06,374
it coming from? Or is that so

1046
00:50:06,412 --> 00:50:08,678
Q? Is this property of distribution of

1047
00:50:08,684 --> 00:50:12,246
beliefs? Is X the belief value and

1048
00:50:12,268 --> 00:50:15,626
that's being generated in

1049
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:16,780
the previous step?

1050
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,678
I think we in the Bowl Marble

1051
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:25,820
thing. Like my question was,

1052
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,374
or I was just pointing out, I guess that

1053
00:50:29,572 --> 00:50:31,774
the hidden state is changing however it

1054
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:34,894
wants, perhaps below our threshold of

1055
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:38,254
observation. That's not

1056
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:40,030
reflected in the equation for obvious

1057
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,358
reasons, but then maybe it crosses a

1058
00:50:43,364 --> 00:50:44,818
threshold and then we update or

1059
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:47,394
whatever. But where is that X coming

1060
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:49,698
from if it's a hidden state? Do you see

1061
00:50:49,704 --> 00:50:50,626
what I'm saying? Is kind of an

1062
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,438
ontological problem there. I'm trying to

1063
00:50:52,444 --> 00:50:53,734
solve it's like it's a hidden state.

1064
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:55,894
How can have a value or be a variable if

1065
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:58,710
it's hidden? Yes,

1066
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,006
Eric, I'll take a stab at

1067
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:04,306
that. So, as shown in the pictures,

1068
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:06,746
there's two hidden states. There's a

1069
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:09,674
hidden state of the real world, and then

1070
00:51:09,712 --> 00:51:10,890
there's a hidden state of your

1071
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,326
generative model. And the generative

1072
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:15,866
model is whatever the model is. And

1073
00:51:15,888 --> 00:51:17,694
that's however the model was built. So

1074
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:20,046
once you have the parameters X, then

1075
00:51:20,068 --> 00:51:21,662
that's what you're working with until

1076
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:25,520
you change your model. That was my

1077
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,246
yes. And over evolutionary or

1078
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:32,446
developmental times, you get swept off

1079
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:34,338
the table if there isn't adequacy, at

1080
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:37,262
least. But in a simulation environment,

1081
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:40,066
you could make the X and the X star to

1082
00:51:40,088 --> 00:51:43,414
be anything but. The hidden state is

1083
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:45,478
as modeled by the generative model of

1084
00:51:45,484 --> 00:51:49,366
the cognitive entity. So in

1085
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:50,966
the cognitive model of the entity, in

1086
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:53,846
the bowl example, they're modeling an

1087
00:51:53,868 --> 00:51:55,786
unobservable, which is the location of

1088
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:57,786
the ball, and they're modeling an

1089
00:51:57,808 --> 00:52:00,634
observable, which is the observation of

1090
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:03,386
location. So both of those are in the

1091
00:52:03,408 --> 00:52:05,066
generative model. And then the

1092
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,538
generative process would be like there's

1093
00:52:06,554 --> 00:52:07,838
somebody with a magnet who's moving the

1094
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:09,246
ball around or something, or it could be

1095
00:52:09,268 --> 00:52:12,702
anything. We're going to have

1096
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,902
five more minutes before we close this

1097
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:19,098
session. So what does

1098
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:22,722
anyone see in 2.4? What is free

1099
00:52:22,776 --> 00:52:25,986
energy minimization doing? And what

1100
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:27,394
does it mean that variational free

1101
00:52:27,432 --> 00:52:29,534
energy is an upper bound on the negative

1102
00:52:29,582 --> 00:52:30,770
log evidence,

1103
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,854
just one quick qualitative read is that

1104
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:45,646
this is what we would actually like to

1105
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:47,886
be minimizing. This is the floor we

1106
00:52:47,908 --> 00:52:51,170
truly want to reach would be unsurprised

1107
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,170
about observations.

1108
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,034
However, that is intractable because

1109
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:00,546
we don't have access to the form or the

1110
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:02,802
parameterization of the true generative

1111
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:04,754
process. What is attractable

1112
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:06,914
approximation? Approximate Bayesian

1113
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:10,194
computation is variational Bayesian

1114
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:13,990
inference. So here's f q of y q

1115
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,530
and y and then this is a KL divergence.

1116
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,058
One vertical pipe means conditioned on

1117
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:25,306
like X conditioned on Y x given Y.

1118
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:28,554
Here probability of a hidden state being

1119
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:31,582
the case given a data or the other

1120
00:53:31,636 --> 00:53:33,002
flipping, which would be the probability

1121
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,194
of given data point given a hidden

1122
00:53:35,242 --> 00:53:37,534
state. Two vertical lines is in

1123
00:53:37,572 --> 00:53:39,978
divergence notation. And that's the

1124
00:53:40,004 --> 00:53:44,130
divergence between this and that between

1125
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,140
Q of X and between P of X given Y.

1126
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,438
So that reducing this divergence,

1127
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:53,782
which has very nice properties in terms

1128
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:58,102
of its implementation, is bringing us

1129
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,686
to lower our upper bound on what we

1130
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:04,198
really want to be minimizing in a

1131
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:06,746
tractable way. So that's one aspect on

1132
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:10,970
free energy minimization. And then here

1133
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,274
is reframing the two ways that free

1134
00:54:13,312 --> 00:54:14,986
energy, variational free energy can be

1135
00:54:15,008 --> 00:54:17,946
minimized through perception, the

1136
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:20,494
updating of beliefs. And we'll talk more

1137
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:22,538
about the continuity between perception

1138
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:25,566
and learning. Like if one observes the

1139
00:54:25,588 --> 00:54:27,646
ball moving across the visual field, is

1140
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:29,974
that perception or is it parameter

1141
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:32,018
learning updating the location of the

1142
00:54:32,024 --> 00:54:34,114
ball? That depends on the timescale and

1143
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:37,634
such or action can be taken so that the

1144
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:39,746
expected observations are changed to

1145
00:54:39,768 --> 00:54:43,926
maximize evidence. And then in

1146
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,558
the last minutes, Ali asked,

1147
00:54:47,724 --> 00:54:50,370
can a hidden state be an unquantifiable

1148
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,814
quality, like a

1149
00:54:53,852 --> 00:54:57,250
qualia quality or like an unquantifiable

1150
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,150
quantity?

1151
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,224
Well, of course most qualities can be

1152
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,788
parameterized, but well,

1153
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:12,940
perhaps we can think of a hidden state

1154
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,300
as a pure quality that

1155
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:20,088
cannot be fundamentally

1156
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:23,756
unquantifiable and we cannot

1157
00:55:23,868 --> 00:55:26,256
parameterize it. I mean, can we think of

1158
00:55:26,278 --> 00:55:27,570
such a hidden state?

1159
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,588
Brock, I was just going to say probably

1160
00:55:35,674 --> 00:55:37,844
the quantifiable way to state that

1161
00:55:37,882 --> 00:55:43,216
question is are there intractable

1162
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,508
hidden states? Which the answer to that

1163
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:49,560
is like, obviously yes. Can we get

1164
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:53,256
some estimate on it? Yes. But then is

1165
00:55:53,278 --> 00:55:57,096
that commensurate with the idea? And

1166
00:55:57,118 --> 00:55:59,144
then does that mean it's a quality and

1167
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:01,932
not a quantity? I don't know. And also

1168
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,916
to the earlier discussion about the

1169
00:56:03,938 --> 00:56:05,564
dimensionality of the generative model

1170
00:56:05,602 --> 00:56:07,196
and the generative process. The

1171
00:56:07,218 --> 00:56:09,196
unquantifiable part could be like the

1172
00:56:09,218 --> 00:56:12,464
baby's happiness, but then we're able to

1173
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,860
still have an inference on the happiness

1174
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,144
as a parameter x, the underlying state

1175
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:19,424
that's giving rise to the different

1176
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:22,892
sounds without necessarily

1177
00:56:22,956 --> 00:56:25,116
knowing the distributional form of

1178
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:27,716
happiness. But we have to have a

1179
00:56:27,738 --> 00:56:29,408
distributional form for the variational

1180
00:56:29,424 --> 00:56:32,548
approximation of happiness. Joe, I was

1181
00:56:32,554 --> 00:56:34,372
just going to say, I think that this

1182
00:56:34,506 --> 00:56:35,984
qualitative versus quantitative

1183
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:37,728
distinction is interesting. If you're

1184
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:39,600
thinking about like a light source,

1185
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,448
it's a source of electrons. Well, you

1186
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:42,836
could count the number of electrons,

1187
00:56:42,868 --> 00:56:44,424
but whether or not there is a light

1188
00:56:44,462 --> 00:56:47,336
source, there a source of electrons in

1189
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:49,336
this framework I'm proposing, you're not

1190
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:50,456
counting that, you're just saying there

1191
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:52,084
is a light source or some other

1192
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,484
dimensions. That's the thing we've been

1193
00:56:53,522 --> 00:56:55,244
calling dimensions. Yes, you can count

1194
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:57,388
the number of dimensions, but given that

1195
00:56:57,394 --> 00:56:58,316
they're all different, they're not

1196
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:01,744
really relatable to each other. Thanks.

1197
00:57:01,862 --> 00:57:06,048
Yes, very interesting. So in our final

1198
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:09,328
seconds, we'll just point towards 2.6,

1199
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:13,168
which is expected free energy g

1200
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:16,116
and its prospective, which is going to

1201
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:19,940
enable inference conditioned on action

1202
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,736
x hidden states, the world conditioned

1203
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:27,976
on policy selection. And that is what is

1204
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:30,312
going to allow comparison of different

1205
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:32,772
policies, which are sequences of actions

1206
00:57:32,836 --> 00:57:36,116
over a given time horizon. So minimizing

1207
00:57:36,148 --> 00:57:39,684
the divergence between two things minus

1208
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:41,836
some things, reframing it as a few

1209
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:45,884
things. So we didn't go as much into 2.6

1210
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:48,556
as we did into 2.5 because 2.5 is an

1211
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:51,828
important precursor and simpler cousin

1212
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:55,568
of 2.6, but it's like super important

1213
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:58,288
and especially to those who are here and

1214
00:57:58,294 --> 00:58:00,992
those who are not here. We would really

1215
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:03,680
love over multiple cohorts when

1216
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,456
everybody will hopefully be able to join

1217
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:07,764
and rejoin as participant, as

1218
00:58:07,802 --> 00:58:11,636
facilitator, to be able to annotate all

1219
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:14,340
the equations with what they mean,

1220
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,420
because what is there to be said about

1221
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,080
expected free energy without some

1222
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,864
understanding of what this is actually

1223
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:23,896
discussing? What variables go in, what

1224
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,416
is it doing, how are some of them being

1225
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:28,936
related? So we want to learn this

1226
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:30,664
and we can do it collaboratively. If

1227
00:58:30,702 --> 00:58:33,568
people just pick and choose affordances,

1228
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:37,100
they see annotate some things and then

1229
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,556
they can highlight it and say I'm not

1230
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:39,788
sure about this, but I just wanted to

1231
00:58:39,794 --> 00:58:41,356
add it. Can somebody improve it? And so

1232
00:58:41,378 --> 00:58:43,136
on. Like we're all there to help each

1233
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:45,276
other learn and improve our epistemic.

1234
00:58:45,308 --> 00:58:48,530
Niche 2.6 is expected. Free energy.

1235
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,596
There's further discussion on Expected

1236
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,964
free energy, showing how it's composed

1237
00:58:54,012 --> 00:58:56,652
of these five sections, and that by

1238
00:58:56,726 --> 00:58:59,956
leaving some out you get different

1239
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:02,950
special cases that are quite important.

1240
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,644
For example, leaving out this, you get

1241
00:59:06,682 --> 00:59:09,672
this leaving out just one, you get 2345

1242
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:12,856
and so on. Figure two six. And then

1243
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,224
there's a summary of the low road to

1244
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,032
active inference. That's chapter two.

1245
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:20,596
So this concludes chapter two and

1246
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:23,436
our discussion in cohort one. In the

1247
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,716
coming two weeks we're going to be

1248
00:59:24,738 --> 00:59:26,892
discussing chapter three, the High Road

1249
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:29,628
to Active Inference. It's going to take

1250
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:32,812
another tack and we will go through it

1251
00:59:32,866 --> 00:59:34,800
in the coming two weeks and be

1252
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,480
addressing people's questions. But

1253
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,624
hopefully we can continue answering and

1254
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,776
addressing just wherever we see fit. No

1255
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:43,264
one's going to do it all, but we do need

1256
00:59:43,302 --> 00:59:46,420
everybody to do some hopefully.

1257
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,656
We're going to now close recording.

1258
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:53,364
We'll then take a 1 minute break and

1259
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:55,204
then in this room we're going to

1260
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:57,796
continue with Dot tools. If you want to

1261
00:59:57,818 --> 00:59:59,876
continue discussing the textbook or

1262
00:59:59,898 --> 01:00:03,892
anything else, then head up to a room up

1263
01:00:03,946 --> 01:00:06,484
and to the left. But in this room in 1

1264
01:00:06,522 --> 01:00:08,368
minute we're going to continue with Dot

1265
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:10,396
tools. So thanks everybody. See you
