650	1246	1	A	0.45805	You.
1428	2478	2	A	0.93763	Hello everyone.
2644	9760	3	A	1.0	It is June 2, 2022 and we're in week five of textbook group cohort one.
10370	19280	4	A	0.72384	We're having our second discussion on chapter two and we will get right to the questions.
19810	28550	5	A	1.0	First, just wanted to highlight the Math learning group, especially for those who are not regularly attending the meetings yet.
28620	31154	6	A	1.0	The meetings are on 19 UTC on Wednesdays.
31202	36486	7	A	0.99997	But just with everything, don't let the synchronous time dissuade you.
36588	40102	8	A	0.99995	We can set up other synchronous times if people want to cowork.
40246	44502	9	A	1.0	And also the resources and the modifications are all asynchronous.
44646	48860	10	A	0.99981	So we've been doing several things in the Math learning group.
49550	53590	11	A	1.0	First, we've been sharing important resources and categorizing them.
53680	61886	12	A	0.99995	So if somebody wants to look at a video on something or find a textbook on something, or if you come across something useful, just add it here.
62068	72100	13	A	1.0	And then if you feel like leveraging the resources that you or other people have added, then you can categorize it in the table and just add a few pieces of information on it.
72630	78550	14	A	1.0	We have a notation table that we'll be building, especially as we get into the continuous time active inference.
79050	89850	15	A	0.99998	We have some questions, less so questions about the textbook and more so, just cool math questions that people are raising as they're discussing the material.
90350	93878	16	A	0.91	And then we're building a math oriented overview.
94054	102142	17	A	0.99997	So we've gotten up to equation 2.5 in chapter two and this is just sort of like point by point, like what are the formalisms doing?
102196	103662	18	A	0.99997	Where are the figures coming into play?
103716	105630	19	A	0.99991	How are some things related?
105970	109898	20	A	1.0	And any and all note taking can be added.
109994	115822	21	A	0.88721	You can always add it to like unsorted notes or erota and then we can categorize it later.
115876	121058	22	A	0.99994	But this is how we develop a shared epistemic resource that's useful for everyone.
121224	123010	23	A	0.98	And we're going to come to this in the questions.
123080	129606	24	A	0.99999	So we won't go into detail right now, but equation 2.5 is the variational free energy.
129708	136162	25	A	1.0	2.6 is about expected free energy, the G, and this is a key equation and set of equations.
136306	157258	26	A	0.99995	So yesterday with Blue, Brock, Jessica Jakub, we went through and line by line we went with examples, natural language readings, questions, interpretations, and then Yaakob added some derivations.
157354	160654	27	A	0.99924	Like how are those three lines in 2.5 related to each other?
160772	167150	28	A	0.79021	How do we go from the energy and entropy formulation to the complexity accuracy formulation?
167310	171730	29	A	0.78443	So this is the essence of understanding the equations.
172550	174658	30	A	0.95866	It's an infinite learning journey for everyone.
174744	177446	31	A	0.99994	So whatever level, whether you want to.
177468	178040	32	B	0.99999	Be.
179850	192106	33	A	0.8826	Catching up to what has been written here, or whether you see ways to reorganize it and go beyond and add more connections, every single background and level of math familiarity can contribute in this way.
192208	195260	34	A	0.99996	But we'll come to the more details on 2.5 in the questions.
197230	202206	35	A	0.76079	Any just preliminary thoughts that people would like to share?
202388	207200	36	A	0.99963	They can raise their hand or write in the chat at any time.
208210	218210	37	A	0.99996	Is there anything that anybody wants to share before we start going through the questions, starting with the most upvoted ones that we haven't addressed, but we'll just pause for a few seconds.
218790	225274	38	A	0.57692	Tune into the chapter two regime of attention upvote any questions that you'd like to see addressed?
225422	227030	39	A	0.86433	Post anything in the chat?
232640	233820	40	A	0.99998	Yes, Jose?
234960	240750	41	C	0.64861	Yeah, I'd like to ask if there's a recording of the math sessions which you had.
241920	251200	42	A	0.95033	No, we record Stick mergically with the traces in the notes and we had this conversation like about whether it should be recorded or et cetera.
251800	257172	43	A	0.52127	If there's enough desire, we could do something like have some unrecorded and some recorded.
257306	266720	44	A	0.99872	This session is obviously recorded and rewatchable here and we do many live streams and there is a lot of recorded material.
266880	275732	45	A	0.99	And so we want to also hold a space for people who don't want to speak on a recorded version, even though everything's recorded in universe and in each other's minds.
275876	282510	46	A	0.99979	But yes, if there's enough interest in people who want to record sessions, we absolutely will do it.
283600	291600	47	A	0.99996	We also just wanted to make sure that there was a total open math learning space where people wouldn't even have that cross their horizon.
292500	294400	48	A	0.99998	But we did discuss that yesterday.
297220	298112	49	A	0.9996	Thank you.
298246	298688	50	A	0.45028	Yeah.
298774	300400	51	A	0.99996	Any other comments?
302740	307024	52	A	0.99999	People can just raise their hand with six in gather or right in the chat.
307072	321608	53	A	0.99614	So we're going to just go to the questions and there's still time to upvote, like during the discussions and we're just going to upvote the ones once we've discussed them.
321694	326730	54	A	0.6049	So we'll start with the first question that we haven't discussed yet.
329840	332830	55	A	0.98202	Okay, this is from page 32.
333760	341152	56	A	0.99991	Policy dependent outcomes are not immediately available, but they can be predicted by chaining together two components of the generative model.
341286	345970	57	A	1.0	The first is our beliefs about how hidden states change their time.
350340	355590	58	A	0.91569	Just want to find what the second part was.
360520	363300	59	A	0.86	The second component is the likelihood distribution.
370250	377110	60	A	0.99947	What really changes as a result of policy selection, the hidden states or the outcomes?
377930	385194	61	A	0.50683	Bringing a jacket doesn't necessarily change the temperature hidden state but instead changes my observation perception of whether it's cold or not.
385392	387958	62	A	1.0	Can we actually change hidden states with policy selection?
387974	389660	63	A	1.0	And what would be an example of this?
391970	396926	64	A	0.99913	Does anyone want to raise their hand and give a thought on this question?
397108	400154	65	A	0.72275	What really changes as a result of policy selection?
400202	407090	66	A	1.0	The hidden states are the outcomes while people are raising their hand.
407160	409380	67	A	0.69893	I'll give one possible thought.
409990	411614	68	A	1.0	The answer is both slash.
411662	412430	69	A	1.0	It depends.
412510	415678	70	A	0.99815	So bringing a jacket does change the temperature around you.
415784	418514	71	A	0.99504	It's not just changing your perception of temperature.
418642	438650	72	A	0.99985	So one example of changing a hidden state with temperature, hidden state of temperature with policy selection would be like changing the setting on the thermostat that is intervening into the causal process, the generative process that's giving rise to temperature, which is giving rise to your perceptions of temperature.
439230	448170	73	A	1.0	And so assuming that your temperature perception is accurate, you are able to change both the temperature in the room or the temperature around you with the jacket.
448330	457170	74	A	0.65	And thus because temperatures are giving rise to observations of temperature, also you end up changing both blue.
460550	467362	75	D	0.99395	So this is my question and I think Karl kind of possibly started to answer it on the live stream yesterday.
467426	470934	76	D	1.0	I need to think about it more and unpack it a little bit more.
470972	479654	77	D	0.99995	But we change the temperature around ourselves, but we're not going to change the thermometer reading by bringing a jacket.
479702	496942	78	D	1.0	Right, but anyway, what Karl said and what might be beneficial for others to hear is that when you think about what's changing, it's like really, when you think about a hidden state, there's a causal chain underlying that hidden state.
496996	503210	79	D	1.0	And the same thing, like when you think about an observation, there's a causal chain underlying that observation.
503370	509106	80	D	0.99	So like, no, I'm not going to change what my eyes tell me the temperature is, but I'm going to change what my body tells me the temperature is.
509128	514834	81	D	1.0	And so it depends because it's a multisensory observation, right?
514872	520790	82	D	0.99982	So which sense is going to change not my visual reading on the thermometer, but my physical perception of cold.
521690	530394	83	A	0.99998	Also yesterday on the live stream, thomas Parr and Karl Friston joined So that was really awesome and a great one to watch.
530432	534890	84	A	0.9	45.1 and we can continue on this Ali and then Mike.
538270	555860	85	E	0.99914	Yeah, I think that's what meant by the word hidden in the statement because if it was transparency observation to any kind of perception or observation, I don't think it would be called a hidden state.
556310	565250	86	E	0.87	I believe that the reason it's called this, it's called as such is because it's opaque to any kind of perception or observation.
565690	578470	87	E	0.99984	So it's kind of inherent to the universe and probably not amenable to any change or action.
579790	582090	88	A	0.58065	Thanks Mike.
586440	590896	89	B	0.53075	Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm thinking about it the right way, but intuitively.
590928	602650	90	C	1.0	I was thinking that policy selection would update the expected conditions or the expected state, so maybe adjusting the priors in evasion sense.
603820	604580	91	A	0.99519	Thanks.
604750	620610	92	A	0.70768	So we'll come to this later, but the answer based upon the partially observable Markov decision process, discrete and continuous time versions, policies pi intervene in between hidden states and how they change their time.
621220	628508	93	A	0.99997	Different hidden states, should they be giving rise to different observations, will result in different observations.
628684	636708	94	A	0.99996	So changing the thermometer policy selection is intervening in the causal process of temperature changing through time in the room hidden state.
636874	645172	95	A	0.72	And if the temperature in the room is associated through the a matrix with your observations of temperature, then you will be changing your observations.
645236	654304	96	A	1.0	And then just like Mike said, that is reflected based upon the expectations that the individual has about the observations of temperature.
654452	660140	97	A	0.81788	So they're both changing because the hidden states and the observations are linked.
660480	671324	98	A	0.99805	That's what it means to have a generative model or for there to be a partially observable model with hidden states and observables hierarchical models.
671452	677104	99	A	1.0	A given state could be in emission from a higher state and emitting a lower state.
677222	682772	100	A	1.0	And that's kind of like how the current moment is like a consequence of the past, but it's a cause of the future.
682906	692020	101	A	0.99991	So this is related to Bayesian modeling, but using this architecture, we can say that policy intervenes only in between hidden states.
692170	695860	102	A	1.0	We don't directly intervene in how observations appear.
700360	703670	103	A	0.99991	Any other thoughts or questions on this question?
712070	712820	104	A	0.94034	Okay.
719530	720440	105	A	0.79449	All right.
723790	737864	106	A	0.78474	In Figure 2.2 figure 2.2 they write x, Star, and X.
737982	741736	107	A	0.99996	So that's going to be generative process and generative model.
741838	742756	108	A	0.99877	Latent variables.
742788	747300	109	A	0.99985	Hidden states do not necessarily live in the same space of measurement.
747460	755340	110	A	1.0	It might be the case that hidden states in the external world take on values that lie outside the space of explanations available to the brain.
755680	761230	111	A	0.99995	Conversely, it might be that the brain's explanations include variables that do not exist in the outside world.
762080	765596	112	A	0.99999	For example, the former could be five dimensional and the latter two dimensional.
765628	768800	113	A	0.99999	Or one could be continuous and the other could be categorical.
769140	786170	114	A	0.68802	So what are examples people can think of where the dimensionality of the generative model, the cognitive entity, is the same as the generative process, the niche process giving rise to observations, passing them to the generative model.
787820	789130	115	A	0.99994	That's one question.
790780	802860	116	A	1.0	Second question how does this approach or framing speak up to the map territory debate hashtag, instrumentalism and realism?
804000	811388	117	A	0.99993	What papers or live streams best characterize how active inference models the action, cognition perception loop?
811564	818236	118	A	0.93	And what other possibilities or models are there for the action, cognition perception loop?
818428	823536	119	A	0.99999	What would be the different strengths and limitations of these different framings and partitionings?
823728	825184	120	A	0.99887	Thanks, Joe.
825232	827910	121	A	0.72	And then Blue and then anyone else who raises their hand.
829880	836644	122	F	0.95	I was just thinking a nice case where you could say dimensionality is pretty obvious is board games.
836692	851288	123	F	0.99063	If I was trying to anticipate what my opponent is going to play in a board game, they have a limited number of possible moves and I'm assuming I'm playing the same game, I'm expecting them to make some move on the same board.
851374	858652	124	F	0.86924	So me, that sounds like the dimensionality is the same because you're in this limited world, I don't have to know what they're thinking.
858706	860516	125	F	1.0	I don't have to know what they had for breakfast.
860648	862624	126	F	0.99	I don't have to know a lot of stuff.
862662	864528	127	F	0.97887	I'm just thinking, and I might be wrong.
864694	865840	128	F	0.35221	What movement?
868740	869248	129	A	0.99956	Great.
869334	870450	130	A	0.65074	Thanks for that.
873800	883990	131	A	0.93012	So with the same dimensionality, it's like if we're playing the same game, then we're playing a game where we're tracking a little cursor on the screen.
884600	890084	132	A	1.0	The movement space within that is just the x and the y value or just two dimensions.
890212	904490	133	A	0.59	And so the observation is like the location in two dimensions, and then that is the same dimensionality that inference is occurring on.
905180	918508	134	F	0.86821	But as an I'm thinking just to add a little bit to more of my comment, if I wanted to enrich it and say oh, but I'm starting to think strategically and anticipating their next move or anticipating maybe they're bluffing or maybe I'm bluffing and I want to see if they know that I'm bluffing.
918604	920044	135	F	0.99525	We add more dimensionality.
920092	930100	136	F	1.0	And I guess in principle, again, you could still add that dimensionality in somehow in parity with parts of the hidden states.
930250	930916	137	F	0.99279	You see what I mean?
930938	936448	138	F	0.99992	That I'm thinking, oh, they think they know I'm bluffing or I think they're bluffing.
936544	938564	139	F	0.99995	You're talking again about the same thing.
938682	940292	140	F	0.7302	You don't have to know what they had for breakfast.
940356	945720	141	F	0.99989	You're just talking about this extra information which isn't in the board itself, but that gets a bit more complicated.
946620	948910	142	A	0.99986	Yes, thanks.
950240	956860	143	A	0.99531	So that is a good answer.
956930	967360	144	A	0.99467	Other ones that people have written thermostat is having the same dimensionality, like it's a temperature value, it's a dimensionality of one.
967510	975248	145	A	1.0	And so then the person's generative model is also on this one dimensional temperature axis.
975424	980512	146	A	1.0	And then they mentioned that it could be like categorical versus continuous.
980656	987108	147	A	0.77616	So without going too many rabbit holes deep, we could just say temperature in the room is a continuous variable.
987204	988584	148	A	0.97412	It's like taking on a number.
988622	993560	149	A	0.82	It could be a decimal point number between any number, zero to infinity.
994780	1000190	150	A	1.0	The person's model might be the same dimensionality like one.
1000560	1004008	151	A	1.0	But then they might be trying to make a categorical estimate.
1004104	1006296	152	A	0.99974	Is this livable or unlivable?
1006408	1008824	153	A	0.77981	Is it hot, neutral or cold?
1008872	1011200	154	A	0.61234	That'd be like a three state categorical model.
1011350	1023090	155	A	0.99994	So the generative process doesn't have to have the same dimensionality or continuous versus discreteness of the generative model.
1027480	1029536	156	A	1.0	Second answer for same dimensionality.
1029648	1041560	157	A	0.99402	Controls for a car have two degrees physical degrees of freedom the acceleration, the speed, whether you can hit the gas or the brake and the direction of the front wheels controlled by the steering wheel.
1042780	1048040	158	A	0.99992	So there's like a speed dimension and then there's a turning angle dimension.
1048560	1054552	159	A	0.99998	This is the model that people use when controlling a car at some level about abstraction.
1054696	1064444	160	A	0.93	And then the acceleration dimension can be acted upon through policy selections like stepping on the gas and the brakes.
1064492	1072384	161	A	0.99	And then it's like, well, those are two categorically different affordances and then there's continuous variables inside of that categorical difference.
1072502	1080310	162	A	1.0	And we'll talk about like hybrid control models with both categorical and continuous aspects in play.
1081480	1086360	163	A	1.0	And in this case, the speed of the car in the speed axis is the hidden state.
1086510	1089480	164	A	1.0	The observable would be the speedometer.
1090780	1096516	165	A	0.99146	So again, the gas and the brake are policy selections that modify.
1096628	1097832	166	A	0.99958	Let's say we're thinking about a train.
1097886	1105390	167	A	0.99982	No turning policy selection is influencing how speed changes through time.
1105920	1113276	168	A	0.99	And if you have a speedometer that's accurate, even if it's noisy, it's giving rise to observations reflecting those changes in speed.
1113468	1117852	169	A	0.96982	But gas and brake do not change the speedometer directly.
1117916	1126092	170	A	0.84379	They're changing a hidden cause, which is the speed different dimensionality rain comes from clouds.
1126156	1130310	171	A	0.99169	Simple mental model is that the darker the clouds, the more there will be.
1130840	1133510	172	A	0.99884	That's a two dimensional generative model.
1135580	1141240	173	A	0.69077	So how much rain, how dark the clouds?
1141580	1144840	174	A	1.0	And this also is going to speak to this map territory.
1145740	1149640	175	A	0.86985	Someone could say, well, there's the size of the cloud and there's also the humidity.
1149720	1154220	176	A	0.99995	So that's like maps with increasing amounts of variables.
1154960	1159308	177	A	0.99997	So no one's denying the territory of the actual chaos of the cloud.
1159474	1164988	178	A	0.83173	It's just a question of how much detail and what data we're actually treating as observables.
1165164	1183344	179	A	1.0	And what sophistication is being taken with unobserved variables with hidden states which are modeled in the computer or on paper, but they're not directly observed, then the mental model can be decomposed even more and then add infinitem.
1183472	1195880	180	A	0.79712	On the reality side, the actual generative process for weather is including all the butterflies.
1196780	1202584	181	A	0.99912	So that's a cognitive model that is two dimensional.
1202632	1210468	182	A	0.83962	In this case, how much rain is expected and how dark is the cloud, that one could make increasingly nuanced cognitive models.
1210664	1218096	183	A	0.99985	But whatever cognitive model is being proposed, the generative process is something that's like totally different.
1218198	1219964	184	A	0.97816	Cognitive model generative.
1220012	1224740	185	A	0.99995	Model map generative process niche territory.
1226200	1229008	186	A	0.94418	Plants do better when they have water and fertilizer.
1229184	1234820	187	A	0.98734	Generative mental Model leaf droopiness is a sign of moisture, but leaf size and color are signs for nutrients.
1235720	1244984	188	A	0.99896	So one could imagine like a causal graph where there's like moisture level is unobserved, but it is emitting leaf droopiness as a state.
1245102	1254360	189	A	0.75714	But we're observing leaf droopiness and we're using that to infer moisture, whereas nutrient is an unobserved state to the visual gardener.
1254520	1257340	190	A	0.6	And then they're using two dimensions, leaf size and color.
1257410	1263404	191	A	0.99999	So this is a three dimensional cognitive model leaf droopiness, leaf size and color are observables.
1263532	1270320	192	A	1.0	And then there's two unobserved cognitive states, nutrients and moisture.
1271700	1275984	193	A	0.99635	But whatever map gets constructed, that's not the plant.
1276112	1294808	194	A	1.0	Now, the gardener might then want to take an informative experiment being an optimal Bayesian gardener, and then measure something, take something that was an unobserved in the initial model and then measure using LiDAR, like using some sort of sensor to understand.
1294974	1306296	195	A	1.0	And then that would make that data point an outcome related through some a matrix, which we're going to get to later of the hidden state being like the true levels of copper.
1306408	1313552	196	A	1.0	And then if we have an accurate test, we can start using the outcomes of the observed levels of copper and start flushing out our model that way.
1313606	1314320	197	A	0.68368	Joe.
1317380	1319680	198	F	0.99	I chucked in a comment below.
1319750	1322304	199	F	1.0	I hope it's showing up just that.
1322422	1327504	200	F	0.58	The other part of the question was asking about the map territory debate.
1327552	1334148	201	F	0.57	And here's from the person who kind of came up with that dichotomy in the way we usually talk about it.
1334154	1336748	202	F	0.99852	He says that the map and territory should have a similar structure.
1336784	1338792	203	F	1.0	And I think that's really interesting to think about.
1338926	1347096	204	F	0.99999	If I'm making again moves in a board game, I might make a reduction of their mental state.
1347278	1349192	205	F	0.98339	Maybe I'm playing against a computer for example.
1349246	1356136	206	F	0.99982	So I don't know that they have a mental state or maybe I'm playing against a person I happen to know as a beginner.
1356168	1359980	207	F	0.99931	So I know they're likely to make naive mistakes or whatever, something like that.
1360130	1369570	208	F	0.99814	But I was just thinking like with regard to the leaf droopiness thing, you could have all kinds of really badly structured models of plant health.
1371380	1374464	209	F	0.99237	Maybe it relates to how recently you watered it or something.
1374502	1380260	210	F	0.86181	Well, that sounds good in general, but if it's a cactus, maybe that's like a defeater to your system.
1380330	1393050	211	F	0.94309	So the point being it seemed interesting that your map should maybe if it doesn't have exactly the same dimensionality, should still be a nice reduction of the thing you're trying to model, whatever that means.
1393820	1394570	212	A	0.99208	Thanks.
1396460	1409260	213	A	1.0	One aspect on this is evolution, natural selection, dissipation in our world, sweeping off the table entities that are failing to at least be adequate.
1409760	1419756	214	A	0.99981	So in a dissipative situation that we're in, the map has to be at least good enough, otherwise the entity will fail to exist.
1419868	1429140	215	A	0.99995	So that sort of closes the loop and is like we're seeing the persistent entities that are acting good enough to navigate.
1430120	1445128	216	A	0.72	And it's just interesting like how many the allegory of the cave to the blind people and the elephant and realism instrumentalism and we've had many live streams on this especially.
1445214	1448840	217	A	0.99995	Check out number 14 on Mel Andrew's paper.
1448990	1451000	218	A	1.0	The math is not the territory.
1451160	1459116	219	A	0.99866	So this one sort of explicitly jumps in right there and tackles this issue with the FEP front and center.
1459218	1462136	220	A	0.99929	So this is a great series of live streams.
1462328	1473552	221	A	1.0	The dot zeros are background and context where we just go over the paper in a small group, like one person or two or three people and then the dot one and the dot two.
1473686	1479584	222	A	0.99989	We usually have more of an open participatory discussion and the authors sometimes to usually join.
1479632	1486100	223	A	0.99991	So everybody's welcome to participate in contributing to dot zeros as well as enjoying the dot one and the dot two.
1486170	1496280	224	A	0.99998	But just so you know, when you're looking in the live stream table, the dot zero is a good one to watch first because it has the background and overview on the paper.
1496350	1506670	225	A	0.99999	But then like yesterday in 45.1, we had Friston and Par join to discuss just so that people can navigate the live streams a little better.
1507120	1518716	226	A	0.71506	So we can continue asynchronously adding more thoughts on like map territory and what papers and live streams and what other possibilities for the action perception loop.
1518748	1521692	227	A	0.99817	But these are big fun areas.
1521756	1528980	228	A	0.99996	But we're going to continue with the questions on the notion of surprise.
1529880	1538516	229	A	0.99855	Is the agent's perception not only affected by the influence of not only its environment but also an agent's peers?
1538708	1546680	230	A	0.99114	So perhaps to restate, how is an agent's perception affected by its direct perception and its assessment of peers?
1547180	1551420	231	A	0.99998	So the agent's peers are updating their beliefs in a collaborative fashion.
1552960	1561064	232	A	0.99996	What would be the extent of the update to an agent's generative model of perception if the agent witnesses the annihilation of one of its peers.
1561112	1567632	233	A	1.0	For example, something like this, okay, will to be from bird box.
1567686	1578912	234	A	0.99713	Not going to open any video links, but perhaps we'll observe some annihilation like some animal attacks one of the wild beast on the right, but then the other one learns.
1579056	1581028	235	A	0.99856	So this is a great video.
1581114	1582950	236	A	0.99998	Definitely good to watch.
1585080	1598120	237	A	0.99998	So far in the textbook and indeed for the textbook it's focusing on just like we saw in figure two two, it's like one entity in the niche.
1598940	1602636	238	A	1.0	The niche can consist of others like me.
1602818	1612156	239	A	0.98067	Other entities that I expect are similar to myself in terms of like the coarse grained cognitive architecture they have or their preferences, their affordances.
1612188	1614640	240	A	0.9999	They're able to do similar things, they want similar things.
1614710	1618320	241	A	0.99999	They have a similar history to some extent.
1619460	1624120	242	A	0.99371	So that is sometimes called thinking through other minds.
1624220	1628950	243	A	0.9589	Ttom and just to give one thought and then anyone can raise their hand.
1629800	1657260	244	A	0.99986	If we were to accurately observe another peer taking some action and then failing to exist, we're driving on the highway, and then we observe somebody taking a policy to go off the highway, and then we see them fail to exist, we could use that information to update our beliefs about the consequences of the action to drive off the highway.
1659600	1677060	245	A	0.9203	So I believe it would be possible to implement every variation of direct perception, direct perception of peers thinking through other minds, theory of mind learning by example, imitation, contrarianism.
1677640	1686792	246	A	0.99996	Every phenomena could be modeled as just has to be whatever the specific model is actually about.
1686846	1687640	247	A	0.83211	Ali.
1692050	1696960	248	E	1.0	I have a related question about 2.5 and 2.6.
1697490	1713320	249	E	0.99998	Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that these equations describe the behavior of a kind of rational behavior or the kind of behavior of a rational agent.
1713930	1717640	250	E	0.94083	Where does irrationality comes into this?
1718570	1726810	251	E	0.99087	Or let me put it this way can irrationality be a parameter?
1727790	1746510	252	E	0.71389	In order to qualify these two equations, 2.5 and 2.6, or seen from the other side, can we use these two equations to measure the extent of rationality as a measurement of rationality?
1747890	1749200	253	A	0.99807	Good question.
1749750	1751182	254	A	0.66637	Here's one quote.
1751246	1754980	255	A	0.89	And we'll come to equation 2.5 and six as well because those are important.
1757750	1761620	256	A	0.74147	Distinguishing the generative model and the generative process is really important.
1762310	1765826	257	A	0.99997	That's the difference between the entity and the niche.
1766018	1772070	258	A	0.77584	It's important to distinguish them to contextualize psychological claims about the optimality of inference.
1772410	1777782	259	A	1.0	To the extent these claims are valid on a Bayesian view is always contingent on the organism's resource.
1777926	1781658	260	A	0.99746	So don't want to step out too far.
1781744	1784854	261	A	1.0	But rationality and irrationality.
1784982	1786554	262	A	0.9713	It's rational to believe in X.
1786592	1789274	263	A	0.75	It is irrational to believe in X is always subjective.
1789322	1797034	264	A	1.0	From that speaker's perspective, given the priors and the update rules, all there is is rationality.
1797082	1799754	265	A	0.80649	Which is to say this is just the Bayesian updating process.
1799892	1806638	266	A	0.99994	So there are maladaptive priors ones that trend towards dissolution of the entity.
1806734	1808702	267	A	0.85224	But there aren't irrational priors.
1808766	1810942	268	A	0.99937	There just is what it is and how it updates.
1811086	1826330	269	A	1.0	And then that could be inadequate, it could be any number of other things and these are like getting into relatively complex cognitive phenomena where there could be like multiple layered models.
1826910	1837840	270	A	0.99993	But I would say rationality in the Bayes process is like the cognition is Bayes optimal or modeled with a Bayesian process.
1838770	1849520	271	A	0.67	And then sometimes the interaction of the generative model and the generative process as appropriately defined specifically is going to result in what it results in.
1852550	1855650	272	A	0.84335	But we will come to 2.5 and 2.6.
1855800	1856402	273	A	0.99623	Okay here.
1856456	1865058	274	A	0.96612	Suffice to say, yes, social learning and collective behavior and emergent outcomes at the group level is something that's important.
1865144	1883660	275	A	1.0	But we haven't addressed it so far in the textbook, and multi agent models are not really addressed in the textbook that much because there's so much to understand about the kernel of the perception cognition action loop that even though it's so important for real systems, it's not brought up.
1893970	1905890	276	A	0.99781	Okay, wanting to go to the equation, the dark room problem for many years, many Papes firing back and forth.
1909130	1915142	277	A	0.99985	But let's go to the equations for our let me check the chat here.
1915196	1933914	278	A	0.55594	Yes, variational free energy is minimized through two different possible approaches minimizing divergence of Q and P, changing mind and maximizing evidence, taking action, changing perception.
1934042	1937760	279	A	0.99999	This is done based upon prior and present information.
1942130	1958130	280	A	0.99976	Equation 2.5 variational free energy to plan best actions, generative models and internal policies produce simulated outcomes that can be used to estimate expected free energy as the average of the log probability of outcomes.
1958970	1971590	281	A	0.90864	Equation 2.6 expected free energy and there's other variants in the context of planning, planning as inference.
1971930	1979770	282	A	0.99993	Equation 2.6 provides a view of EFE that establishes consistency in measurement units of exploration, exploitation.
1980670	1986750	283	A	1.0	The relative balance between these terms determines whether behavior is predominantly explorative or exploitative.
1987410	1997340	284	A	0.99	34 in other words, dissolving the classic explore exploit dilemma in behavioral psychology.
1998820	2001344	285	A	0.99994	What causes this balance to change?
2001462	2002032	286	A	0.64	I e.
2002086	2003760	287	A	0.99999	What controls this balance?
2004180	2007250	288	A	0.99996	Very important and interesting question.
2009720	2015510	289	A	0.95156	Perhaps we can come to equation 2.5 first and then we can come to equation 2.6.
2015960	2020550	290	A	0.99236	So where we're going is the future.
2020920	2027480	291	A	0.99	The future has several sources of, in principle and in practice uncertainty.
2027900	2030490	292	A	0.76252	Observations in the future have not happened.
2030860	2043528	293	A	0.99312	Actions in the future have not happened and the causes of future outcomes and hidden states actions as well as the generative processes endogenous changes haven't occurred.
2043624	2052530	294	A	0.99997	So there are several fundamental and in practice limitations of the kind of precision that you can get on the future.
2053620	2065430	295	A	0.96154	That's planning as inference, it's prospective in contrast and that's expected free energy because it's about the free energy of an expected future.
2067000	2076824	296	A	0.85595	Variational free energy f expected free energy is g variational free energy F is in equation 2.5.
2077022	2082970	297	A	0.89442	Variational free energy as the question says, is based upon present and prior information.
2083420	2094984	298	A	0.99995	So variational free energy is like now casting and verging into something kind of like memory as inference.
2095112	2102848	299	A	0.99993	We're integrating the past in the sense of our priors and the present incoming data point why?
2103014	2110310	300	A	1.0	And it's like a snapshot evaluation of optimal perception in the purely sensory case.
2110920	2118580	301	A	1.0	And if we include action within variational free energy, it's taking one step optimal actions.
2119480	2122788	302	A	0.9985	But those are not necessarily like the ones that's not planning.
2122884	2125464	303	A	0.99931	That's just like snapshot decision making.
2125662	2132484	304	A	0.99973	In contrast, 2.6 will explicitly consider policies.
2132532	2138888	305	A	1.0	It is a function of policy pi and so it is including planning as inference.
2138984	2141630	306	A	0.99989	But first let's look at 2.5.
2148580	2150370	307	A	0.24228	Yaakov or anyone else.
2150740	2154770	308	A	0.99991	Would you like to just describe one pass?
2155140	2157840	309	A	0.99943	What is equation 2.5 showing?
2171220	2193192	310	B	0.56	I guess if you mean like describing, say, the first line or the lines in a bit more detail, essentially the energy term is just the expectation of the log of the joint probability of the data and the observation.
2193256	2207810	311	B	0.95831	So I don't understand quite why they changed the notation from appendix B, but Y would essentially be the S, I think, and X would be the O.
2212140	2228716	312	A	0.99981	Yes, anyone could be taking more notes on this, but Y is the observable data and X is the hidden state in the POMDP that we're going to be getting to later x out there, the hidden state is S and O are observations.
2228828	2235660	313	A	0.99997	So this is using more of a regression familiar framework and variable notation.
2235820	2244832	314	A	0.77748	But this could also be written LNP of O comma S observations and states that's the joint distribution.
2244976	2249380	315	A	0.98646	Joint distribution with a comma conditional distributions with a vertical pipe.
2253610	2253926	316	B	0.90248	Yeah.
2253948	2261110	317	B	0.86	And so we are also taking the entropy term is only based on the beliefs of our hidden states.
2261180	2267986	318	B	0.53242	So people were saying before that the hidden states are unobservable.
2268178	2274360	319	B	1.0	The only thing that we can say about the hidden states are the beliefs about the hidden states.
2275050	2286286	320	B	1.0	I don't think that the hidden states X can ever really appear on their own because we always need to have some kind of belief about them.
2286388	2324380	321	B	0.62	And this was also related to a discussion we were having yesterday that's interesting that they kind of switched between the notation of entropy with H as the functional and just the pure expectation with the E, because the actual definition of entropy is the expectation of the negative log of whatever is in is the variable, which in this case is Q of X.
2325390	2332538	322	B	1.0	And that's actually how we get to the other two expressions with complexity and accuracy and divergence and evidence.
2332634	2355830	323	B	1.0	And there's also a link I think might be wrong with to theoretical physics where free energy is essentially the kind of cognitive statistical equivalent of the Lagrangian, which is defined as kinetic energy minus potential energy.
2355900	2374346	324	B	0.99991	So we were discussing yesterday what that means in terms of the energy and entropy in this case, whether the energy is perhaps kind of the immediate cognitive kinetic energy and then the entropy is like.
2374368	2381360	325	B	0.93	The potential energy or vice versa might be going off on a tangent at this point.
2382290	2382990	326	A	0.5914	Awesome.
2383140	2386030	327	A	0.99992	Let me just add in a few other notes.
2386850	2390020	328	A	1.0	The variables f is a function.
2390470	2393074	329	A	0.69623	It's the variational free energy function.
2393272	2396850	330	A	1.0	The arguments that it is taking in are Q.
2397000	2399618	331	A	0.99988	That's the variational distribution that we control.
2399704	2402302	332	A	0.99987	That's what makes it a variational free energy.
2402456	2404854	333	A	0.94	Q is the one that we control.
2405052	2408726	334	A	1.0	P is the actual probability distribution out there.
2408908	2410600	335	A	0.89	Y is the data point.
2410970	2418300	336	A	0.99802	So we have on the left side of the equation, variational free energy is a function of Q and Y.
2418910	2427840	337	A	0.99996	On the right side, we have three equal signs and these are three values, three ways to phrase this one function.
2429090	2436878	338	A	0.99982	In the bottom here, Yaakov has shown how this energy minus entropy can result.
2436964	2443262	339	A	0.96073	In the second line, complexity minus accuracy, and in the third line, divergence minus evidence.
2443406	2451890	340	A	0.99895	So that was like one really interesting thing, is it's not like this is how it is and this is a transformation and then this is the transformation.
2452390	2466780	341	A	0.94639	Even though in a sense that was also true, it is also probably helpful to think about this energy minus entropy formalism for what it is, which is the closest to a physics framing of free energy.
2467150	2482400	342	A	1.0	And then think about these two more statistical ontology ways of framing it, complexity minus accuracy, which is like very commonly brought up in the context of model fitting and divergence minus evidence also.
2484050	2485054	343	A	0.94	And yeah, great.
2485092	2493970	344	A	0.99685	So Blue, if that sounds like a very helpful norm in the description, we'll try to have like a description of the equation.
2494470	2500114	345	A	1.0	The first row says this, this people can type it however they want.
2500152	2510920	346	A	0.94	And then of course, we can replace terms that are in the ontology with the special at sign.
2511370	2525290	347	A	0.94	And that will facilitate finding equations that mention those terms and it will facilitate translating these equations and also the descriptions into different languages, computer languages and human languages.
2525870	2532922	348	A	0.99999	So then we can work on it in this ontological space and then make sure that it's accessible to different languages.
2532986	2542990	349	A	1.0	For example, then we thought about this example of like a ball and its location in a bowl.
2543150	2548930	350	A	0.95783	So there's a true location of where it is in the bowl X.
2549080	2553800	351	A	0.99	And then there's an observation of where we're observing the ball to be.
2555530	2558882	352	A	1.0	And this also speaks to the quantum to classical handoff.
2559026	2568220	353	A	0.99957	If the bowl is a swimming pool and the ball is a bowling ball, after enough time, it's going to be at the bottom and not moving.
2568910	2582334	354	A	0.99999	If the bowl is like a molecular well and the ball is like an electron or like one atom, then repeated measurement is going to be entirely different.
2582452	2589070	355	A	0.83	And as the ball in the bowl become more massive, it approaches like a classical limit.
2590870	2598770	356	A	0.99853	Little hints at the continuity between classical statistical and quantum and thermophysics.
2599190	2601938	357	A	0.99987	But we thought about this ball being in the bowl.
2602114	2627646	358	A	0.96528	So we looked at two different cases, which is when the ball is being observed in the bottom of the bowl, it's like, given the generative model of the shape of the bowl and gravity, which is like a potential energy function, observing the ball at the center of the bowl is, like, strictly the most likely thing that could have happened.
2627828	2631710	359	A	1.0	And then observing it up on a side is like a less likely observation.
2632130	2634030	360	A	0.99661	Eric and then blue.
2639570	2640320	361	G	0.95882	Yeah.
2640930	2643698	362	G	0.94557	So you mentioned that F is a function.
2643784	2649214	363	G	0.76	And as they put it, it's a function of a function, which is a functional.
2649342	2655490	364	G	0.99993	So the way I think about this is that the function that it's a function of is the Q.
2655560	2658594	365	G	0.99982	So the Q is a distribution over your beliefs.
2658722	2661474	366	G	0.99788	So I think of that as being a function that you're trying to optimize.
2661522	2667820	367	G	0.89074	You're trying to say, well, how do I adjust my internal belief state the Q.
2668510	2671702	368	G	1.0	And that's what I'm optimizing in this equation.
2671766	2675846	369	G	0.95	And the functional says that's what I'm trying to optimize is that function and distribution.
2675958	2689406	370	G	1.0	And then it breaks down into the two parts, which is your generative Model P, which says well, P says for any there's the joint probability of X.
2689588	2697134	371	G	0.71	X is the internal state variable that you have a distribution over that's Q.
2697332	2702182	372	G	1.0	And so how do your Observables and your internal states go together?
2702316	2720140	373	G	1.0	And then you have the entropy term, which is well, you want to have maximum uncertainty so that if you're not constrained by your observations, you want to be as agnostic as possible about what the possible values are of your internal states or make that queue as flat as possible.
2721390	2727742	374	G	0.99818	As flat as possible under the constraints of the observations going through your generative Model P.
2727876	2731200	375	G	0.99993	So I guess that's the way I talk through this first line.
2732130	2732830	376	A	0.99995	Awesome.
2732980	2735870	377	A	0.99994	Thank you, eric blue and then Brock.
2736610	2738694	378	D	0.54292	So, Eric, that was super helpful.
2738842	2743634	379	D	0.52126	I've been since yesterday trying to figure out what exactly is meant by Q.
2743752	2744420	380	D	0.99996	Here.
2744790	2749470	381	D	0.92	I get later on we're going to talk about Q as representing beliefs.
2749550	2757640	382	D	0.72162	But as it's given, as it's laid out in chapter two, they don't actually define Q at all.
2759290	2762726	383	D	0.59656	So I am having a hard time up here.
2762828	2767420	384	D	0.99999	They describe it right before they get into that box.
2767870	2773050	385	D	1.0	They describe Q in Section 2.6 as an approximate posterior.
2773390	2776234	386	D	0.69441	So approximate posterior of what?
2776272	2781280	387	D	1.0	And should we denote Q as the function of beliefs here?
2781650	2786782	388	D	0.99996	Even though it's like they're skipping ahead and looping back at the same time?
2786836	2788286	389	D	1.0	It seems like, or feels like to.
2788308	2797466	390	A	1.0	Me, q is the variational distribution where the form of the posterior has been chosen.
2797658	2814682	391	A	0.99988	So exact bays using matrix multiplication, basically, or sampling based approaches to approximate Bayesian computation, like Monte Carlo, Markov chain, those try to recapitulate the actual form of P.
2814816	2823318	392	A	0.99999	So if P is truly bimodal, then exact Bayes or sampling based approaches would try to reconstruct that distribution.
2823494	2841194	393	A	0.89329	In contrast, the variational approach gains tractability because you're choosing a posterior, approximate posterior, a Q of a form that you know is going to have a tractable optimization scheme and there's message passing algorithms that can do it computationally.
2841322	2860230	394	A	0.99994	So if you choose Q to be a gaussian, then depending on how you parameterize it, it's either going to be seeking the mode and go to the hump that's bigger and center around that with a variance, or it'll just spread out a lot and go over and try to cover as much probability density as it can by covering both humps.
2861050	2880346	395	D	0.99952	Okay, so the variation of free energy function F as a function of the function representing the approximate posterior Q and the data Y is equal to the negative expectation of Q given the observations x times the natural log of the probability of the joint distribution of the data and observations.
2880458	2882234	396	D	0.79792	Is that the English translation of that equation?
2882282	2883742	397	D	1.0	I think I got it finally, after.
2883796	2888046	398	F	0.99771	Like two days minus close, I would.
2888068	2890770	399	G	0.9996	Say one thing I would say slightly different.
2890920	2895700	400	G	0.99996	It's the expectation over Q, not expectation of Q.
2897830	2900370	401	A	0.78567	We actually talked about that a little bit.
2900440	2906120	402	A	0.97778	Like here we had negative expectation over Q and yes.
2908330	2910294	403	A	0.74139	Okay, blue then.
2910332	2915034	404	D	0.9739	Brock yeah, sorry, the ontology terms don't match the terms that are given in the book.
2915072	2917146	405	D	0.79	And I put in a request in the questions here.
2917168	2925450	406	D	0.99999	If we can append the ontology because they use data is the same as observations.
2927410	2931040	407	A	0.99752	Those are different words, but they're similar.
2932930	2938910	408	D	0.92895	Yeah, there's a lot of synonyms or synonymous use, and so I would hate to step on them.
2938980	2943026	409	D	0.9999	But also the terms aren't in the ontology at all.
2943048	2946180	410	D	0.99991	So maybe we should update the ontology to reflect the terms.
2946630	2953074	411	A	0.99978	We will absolutely add terms into the supplemental or eventually into the core terms if that's required.
2953122	2963470	412	A	0.99998	But just leave a comment or email activeinference at gmail to add terms to the ontology if there's a term that you want to tag that's not being tagged.
2963650	2964410	413	A	0.64298	Frock.
2968190	2983360	414	C	0.56	I feel like you may have indirectly answered this just now, but in the math discussion yesterday, we were talking about specifically about the Q, the distribution of beliefs over there.
2986290	3001958	415	C	0.99995	If X is this uncertainty term, this hidden state, like, what what value could it possibly have?
3002044	3003640	416	C	0.99999	Where is it coming from?
3004250	3006614	417	C	0.86634	Or is that so Q?
3006652	3008946	418	C	0.92661	Is this property of distribution of beliefs?
3008978	3016780	419	C	0.97152	Is X the belief value and that's being generated in the previous step?
3019230	3023420	420	C	0.5	I think we in the Bowl Marble thing.
3024190	3035870	421	C	0.52319	Like my question was, or I was just pointing out, I guess that the hidden state is changing however it wants, perhaps below our threshold of observation.
3037570	3045234	422	C	0.99932	That's not reflected in the equation for obvious reasons, but then maybe it crosses a threshold and then we update or whatever.
3045352	3049058	423	C	0.99942	But where is that X coming from if it's a hidden state?
3049224	3049986	424	A	0.9854	Do you see what I'm saying?
3050008	3051986	425	C	0.46478	Is kind of an ontological problem there.
3052008	3053734	426	C	0.80724	I'm trying to solve it's like it's a hidden state.
3053772	3056790	427	C	0.9999	How can have a value or be a variable if it's hidden?
3058250	3062502	428	G	0.68417	Yes, Eric, I'll take a stab at that.
3062636	3065560	429	G	0.96508	So, as shown in the pictures, there's two hidden states.
3066190	3072140	430	G	0.99994	There's a hidden state of the real world, and then there's a hidden state of your generative model.
3073470	3075706	431	G	1.0	And the generative model is whatever the model is.
3075728	3077358	432	G	1.0	And that's however the model was built.
3077444	3083200	433	G	0.9999	So once you have the parameters X, then that's what you're working with until you change your model.
3084370	3087470	434	A	0.99944	That was my yes.
3087620	3094900	435	A	0.97	And over evolutionary or developmental times, you get swept off the table if there isn't adequacy, at least.
3095350	3101220	436	A	0.99999	But in a simulation environment, you could make the X and the X star to be anything but.
3102170	3106870	437	A	1.0	The hidden state is as modeled by the generative model of the cognitive entity.
3108090	3121450	438	A	0.99461	So in the cognitive model of the entity, in the bowl example, they're modeling an unobservable, which is the location of the ball, and they're modeling an observable, which is the observation of location.
3121870	3124410	439	A	0.99981	So both of those are in the generative model.
3124560	3129840	440	A	1.0	And then the generative process would be like there's somebody with a magnet who's moving the ball around or something, or it could be anything.
3131810	3136778	441	A	0.9986	We're going to have five more minutes before we close this session.
3136954	3141106	442	A	0.99704	So what does anyone see in 2.4?
3141288	3145266	443	A	0.99996	What is free energy minimization doing?
3145448	3166666	444	A	0.56	And what does it mean that variational free energy is an upper bound on the negative log evidence, just one quick qualitative read is that this is what we would actually like to be minimizing.
3166778	3173170	445	A	0.94631	This is the floor we truly want to reach would be unsurprised about observations.
3174550	3183526	446	A	1.0	However, that is intractable because we don't have access to the form or the parameterization of the true generative process.
3183708	3185666	447	A	0.99999	What is attractable approximation?
3185778	3190818	448	A	0.94596	Approximate Bayesian computation is variational Bayesian inference.
3190914	3197530	449	A	0.98427	So here's f q of y q and y and then this is a KL divergence.
3198910	3205306	450	A	1.0	One vertical pipe means conditioned on like X conditioned on Y x given Y.
3205408	3215742	451	A	0.99997	Here probability of a hidden state being the case given a data or the other flipping, which would be the probability of given data point given a hidden state.
3215876	3218890	452	A	0.99	Two vertical lines is in divergence notation.
3219050	3227140	453	A	1.0	And that's the divergence between this and that between Q of X and between P of X given Y.
3227590	3245098	454	A	0.94876	So that reducing this divergence, which has very nice properties in terms of its implementation, is bringing us to lower our upper bound on what we really want to be minimizing in a tractable way.
3245184	3248090	455	A	0.92069	So that's one aspect on free energy minimization.
3248590	3259514	456	A	0.93	And then here is reframing the two ways that free energy, variational free energy can be minimized through perception, the updating of beliefs.
3259642	3263406	457	A	1.0	And we'll talk more about the continuity between perception and learning.
3263588	3272558	458	A	0.98529	Like if one observes the ball moving across the visual field, is that perception or is it parameter learning updating the location of the ball?
3272654	3281250	459	A	0.99999	That depends on the timescale and such or action can be taken so that the expected observations are changed to maximize evidence.
3282170	3298150	460	A	0.93	And then in the last minutes, Ali asked, can a hidden state be an unquantifiable quality, like a qualia quality or like an unquantifiable quantity?
3303980	3324992	461	E	0.98654	Well, of course most qualities can be parameterized, but well, perhaps we can think of a hidden state as a pure quality that cannot be fundamentally unquantifiable and we cannot parameterize it.
3325046	3327570	462	E	0.58	I mean, can we think of such a hidden state?
3332340	3344404	463	C	0.83271	Brock, I was just going to say probably the quantifiable way to state that question is are there intractable hidden states?
3344522	3347210	464	C	0.99999	Which the answer to that is like, obviously yes.
3348460	3351192	465	C	1.0	Can we get some estimate on it?
3351246	3351848	466	A	0.99999	Yes.
3352014	3356712	467	C	0.99361	But then is that commensurate with the idea?
3356846	3359892	468	C	0.97	And then does that mean it's a quality and not a quantity?
3359956	3360830	469	C	1.0	I don't know.
3361280	3366780	470	A	1.0	And also to the earlier discussion about the dimensionality of the generative model and the generative process.
3366930	3385872	471	A	1.0	The unquantifiable part could be like the baby's happiness, but then we're able to still have an inference on the happiness as a parameter x, the underlying state that's giving rise to the different sounds without necessarily knowing the distributional form of happiness.
3386016	3390656	472	A	0.5584	But we have to have a distributional form for the variational approximation of happiness.
3390768	3397380	473	F	0.99486	Joe, I was just going to say, I think that this qualitative versus quantitative distinction is interesting.
3397450	3401156	474	F	0.99714	If you're thinking about like a light source, it's a source of electrons.
3401188	3412632	475	F	0.9793	Well, you could count the number of electrons, but whether or not there is a light source, there a source of electrons in this framework I'm proposing, you're not counting that, you're just saying there is a light source or some other dimensions.
3412696	3414376	476	F	0.80616	That's the thing we've been calling dimensions.
3414488	3419950	477	F	0.99992	Yes, you can count the number of dimensions, but given that they're all different, they're not really relatable to each other.
3421140	3421744	478	A	0.91767	Thanks.
3421862	3423170	479	A	0.99757	Yes, very interesting.
3424100	3446500	480	A	0.88239	So in our final seconds, we'll just point towards 2.6, which is expected free energy g and its prospective, which is going to enable inference conditioned on action x hidden states, the world conditioned on policy selection.
3446860	3454644	481	A	0.87	And that is what is going to allow comparison of different policies, which are sequences of actions over a given time horizon.
3454772	3462332	482	A	0.99992	So minimizing the divergence between two things minus some things, reframing it as a few things.
3462466	3479248	483	A	0.9177	So we didn't go as much into 2.6 as we did into 2.5 because 2.5 is an important precursor and simpler cousin of 2.6, but it's like super important and especially to those who are here and those who are not here.
3479334	3502644	484	A	0.99521	We would really love over multiple cohorts when everybody will hopefully be able to join and rejoin as participant, as facilitator, to be able to annotate all the equations with what they mean, because what is there to be said about expected free energy without some understanding of what this is actually discussing?
3502692	3505956	485	A	0.99999	What variables go in, what is it doing, how are some of them being related?
3506068	3510404	486	A	0.51508	So we want to learn this and we can do it collaboratively.
3510452	3520124	487	A	0.99998	If people just pick and choose affordances, they see annotate some things and then they can highlight it and say I'm not sure about this, but I just wanted to add it.
3520162	3521036	488	A	0.99852	Can somebody improve it?
3521058	3521564	489	A	1.0	And so on.
3521602	3525276	490	A	0.72391	Like we're all there to help each other learn and improve our epistemic.
3525308	3527676	491	A	0.99842	Niche 2.6 is expected.
3527708	3528530	492	A	0.99997	Free energy.
3528900	3542950	493	A	0.82577	There's further discussion on Expected free energy, showing how it's composed of these five sections, and that by leaving some out you get different special cases that are quite important.
3543720	3550488	494	A	0.99992	For example, leaving out this, you get this leaving out just one, you get 2345 and so on.
3550574	3551896	495	A	0.43241	Figure two six.
3552078	3555876	496	A	1.0	And then there's a summary of the low road to active inference.
3555908	3557032	497	A	0.99996	That's chapter two.
3557166	3562796	498	A	0.99992	So this concludes chapter two and our discussion in cohort one.
3562978	3568376	499	A	0.99975	In the coming two weeks we're going to be discussing chapter three, the High Road to Active Inference.
3568568	3576080	500	A	0.99543	It's going to take another tack and we will go through it in the coming two weeks and be addressing people's questions.
3576150	3581392	501	A	0.90537	But hopefully we can continue answering and addressing just wherever we see fit.
3581526	3586420	502	A	1.0	No one's going to do it all, but we do need everybody to do some hopefully.
3588040	3590656	503	A	0.99866	We're going to now close recording.
3590768	3596960	504	A	0.842	We'll then take a 1 minute break and then in this room we're going to continue with Dot tools.
3597120	3604788	505	A	0.99987	If you want to continue discussing the textbook or anything else, then head up to a room up and to the left.
3604874	3608856	506	A	0.99994	But in this room in 1 minute we're going to continue with Dot tools.
3608928	3609980	507	A	0.99906	So thanks everybody.
3610050	3610990	508	A	0.99942	See you soon.
