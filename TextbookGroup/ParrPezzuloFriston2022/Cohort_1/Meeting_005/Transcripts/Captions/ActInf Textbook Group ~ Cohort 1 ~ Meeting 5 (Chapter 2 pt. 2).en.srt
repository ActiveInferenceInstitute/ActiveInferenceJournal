1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,720
hello everyone

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,920
it is june 2nd 2022

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,559
and we're in week five of textbook group

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,400
cohort one

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
we're having our second discussion on

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,280
chapter two

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,480
and we will uh get right to the

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,840
questions

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
first just wanted to highlight the math

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
learning group especially for those who

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,320
are

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,480
not regularly attending the meetings yet

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
the meetings are on 19 utc on wednesdays

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,680
but just with everything

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,920
don't let the synchronous time dissuade

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,000
you we can set up other synchronous

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,239
times if people want to co-work

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,239
and also the resources and the

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
modifications are all asynchronous

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,719
so we've been doing several things in

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,520
the

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
math learning group

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
first we've been sharing important

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
resources and categorizing them so if

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
somebody wants to

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,280
look at a video on something or find a

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,719
textbook on something or if you come

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,079
across something useful just add it here

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
and then if you feel like

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
leveraging the resources that you or

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,840
other people have added then you can

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
categorize it in the table and just add

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
a few pieces of information on it

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
we have a notation table that we'll be

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
building especially as we get into the

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
continuous time active inference

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
we have some questions

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,439
less so questions about the textbook and

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,840
more so just cool math questions that

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,720
people are raising as they're discussing

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
the material

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
and then we're building a math oriented

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,079
overview

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,880
so we've gotten up to equation 2.5

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
in chapter two

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,240
and this is just sort of like point by

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,000
point like what are the formalisms doing

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
where are the figures coming into play

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
how are some things related

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,720
and

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,000
any and all note taking can be added you

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
can always add it to like unsorted notes

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,360
or errata and then we can categorize it

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
later but this is how we develop a

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,159
shared epistemic resource that's useful

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,280
for everyone

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
and we're going to come to this in the

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
questions so we won't go into detail

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
right now

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,240
but

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
equation 2.5 is the variational free

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,760
energy 2.6 is about expected free energy

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
the g

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,599
and

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,360
this is a key equation instead of

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
equations so yesterday with um

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
uh blue

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
brock jessica jacob

69
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,080
we

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
went through

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
and line by line we went with examples

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
natural language readings

73
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
questions interpretations

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and then jakob added um some

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
derivations like how are those three

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,879
lines in 2.5 related to each other how

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
do we go from the energy and entropy

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
formulation to the complex complexity

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
accuracy formulation

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
so

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,800
this is the essence of understanding the

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
equations

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
it's an infinite learning journey for

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
everyone so whatever level whether you

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,640
want to be

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
um

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
catching up to what has been written

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,200
here or whether you see ways to

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
reorganize it and go beyond and add more

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,959
connections

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,159
every single

92
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
background and level of math familiarity

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
can contribute in this way but we'll

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
come to the more details on 2.5 in the

95
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
questions

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
any

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
just

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,959
preliminary thoughts that people would

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,400
like to share

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
they can raise their hand or write in

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,239
the chat at any time

102
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,519
is there anything that anybody wants to

103
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
share before we start going through the

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,480
questions

105
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,159
starting with the most upvoted ones that

106
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,920
we haven't addressed

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
but we'll just pause for a few seconds

108
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,640
tune into the chapter 2 regime of

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
attention

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
upvote any questions that you'd like to

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
see addressed

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,400
post anything in the chat

113
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,959
yes jose

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
yeah i i'd like to ask if there's a

115
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,959
recording of the

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
math sessions which you had

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,040
no no

118
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
we record stick mergingly with the

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
traces in the notes but and we had this

120
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,120
conversation like about whether it

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
should be recorded or etc

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
if there's enough desire we could do

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
something like have some unrecorded and

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,639
some recorded this session is obviously

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
recorded and rewatchable here

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,120
and we do many live streams and there is

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
a lot of recorded material and so we

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
want to also hold a space for people who

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,240
don't want to

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
speak on a recorded version even though

131
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
everything's recorded in universe and in

132
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,759
each other's minds

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
but um

134
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
yes if there's enough interest in people

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
who want to record sessions we

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
absolutely will do it

137
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
we also just wanted to make sure that

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,479
there was a total

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
open math learning space where people

140
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
wouldn't even have that cross their

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
horizon

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,520
but we did discuss that yesterday

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,240
thank you

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
yeah any other like comments

145
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
people can just raise their hand with

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
six in gather or right in the chat so

147
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
we're going to um

148
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,560
just

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
go to the questions

150
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
and there's still time to upload like

151
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
during the discussions and we're just

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,919
gonna uh

153
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
i upload the ones once we've discussed

154
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,840
them so we'll start

155
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,520
with the first question that we haven't

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,240
discussed yet

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,759
okay this is from page 32.

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
policy dependent outcomes

159
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,520
are not immediately available but they

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,199
can be predicted by chaining together

161
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,280
two components of the generative model

162
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
the first is our beliefs about

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,440
how hidden states change their time

164
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
just want to find what the second

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,039
part was

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,319
the second component is the likelihood

167
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,319
distribution

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
what really changes as a result of

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,560
policy selection

170
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
the hidden states or the outcomes

171
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,919
bringing a jacket doesn't necessarily

172
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,360
change the temperature hidden state but

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
instead changes my observation

174
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
perception of whether it's cold or not

175
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
can we actually change hidden states

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,319
with policy selection and what would be

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,039
an example of this

178
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
does anyone want to raise their hand and

179
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
give a thought on

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
this question

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
what really changes as a result of

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
policy selection the hidden states are

183
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
the outcomes

184
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
while people are raising their hand i'll

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,000
give one possible thought

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,639
the answer is both slash it depends so

187
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
bringing a jacket does change the

188
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,479
temperature around you it's not just

189
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
changing your perception of temperature

190
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
so one example of changing a hidden

191
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,360
state with temperature

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
um hidden state of temperature with

193
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,919
policy selection would be like changing

194
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
the setting on the thermostat

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that is intervening into the causal

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
process the generative process that's

197
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,919
giving rise to temperature which is

198
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,680
giving rise to your perceptions of

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
temperature

200
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
and so assuming that your temperature

201
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
perception is accurate you are able to

202
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
change both the temperature in the room

203
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
or the temperature around you with the

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,319
jacket

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,199
and

206
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
thus because temperatures are giving

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
rise to observations of temperature

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
also you end up changing both blue

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
so this was my question and i think um

210
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
carl kind of possibly started to answer

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
it on the live stream yesterday i need

212
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
to like think about it more and unpack

213
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
it a little bit more but like we don't

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,280
actually change

215
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,039
we change like the temperature around

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,560
ourselves but like we're not going to

217
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
change the thermometer reading by

218
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
bringing a jacket right so

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,039
there's like the

220
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,160
yeah

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,759
but anyway what carl said and what might

222
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
be beneficial for others to hear is that

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
um when you think about

224
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,319
what's changing it's like really when

225
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
you think about a hidden state there's a

226
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
causal chain underlying that hidden

227
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
state and the same thing like when you

228
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,479
think about an observation there's a

229
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,360
causal chain underlying that observation

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,960
so like no i'm not going to change what

231
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
my eyes tell me the temperature is but

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
i'm going to change what my body tells

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
me the temperature is and so it depends

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,519
because it's a multi-sensory

235
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
observation right so which sense is

236
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
going to change not my visual reading on

237
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,279
the thermometer but my physical

238
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,679
perception of gold

239
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,800
also yesterday on the live stream

240
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
thomas parr and carl first and joined so

241
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,519
that was really awesome and a

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
great one to watch 45.1 and we can

243
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,240
continue on this um ali and then mike

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,399
uh yeah i think that's

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,040
what meant by the word hidden

246
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
in the statement because

247
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,600
if

248
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,399
it was

249
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,760
transparency observation to any kind of

250
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
perception or observation

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,080
i i don't think it would it would be

252
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
called a hidden state

253
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
i believe that the reason it's called

254
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
this is it's called as such is

255
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,440
because it's opaque to any kind of

256
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
perception or observation

257
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
so it's kind of

258
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
inherent to the universe and uh

259
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,399
probably

260
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,839
uh not amenable to any

261
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,480
uh

262
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
any change or action

263
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,279
thanks

264
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
mike

265
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
yeah i'm not sure if i'm thinking about

266
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,959
it the right way but i intuitively i was

267
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
thinking that policy selection would

268
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
uh update the expected conditions or the

269
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
expected state so maybe

270
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,839
adjusting the priors in a bayesian

271
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,800
sense

272
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,519
so we'll come to this later but the

273
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
answer based upon the partially

274
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
observable markov decision process

275
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
discrete and continuous time versions

276
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
policies pi

277
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
intervene in between hidden states and

278
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
how they change through time

279
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,959
different hidden states

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
should they be giving rise to different

281
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
observations

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
will result in different observations

283
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
so changing the thermometer policy

284
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
selection is intervening in the causal

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
process of temperature changing through

286
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
time in the room hidden state

287
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,279
and if the temperature in the room is

288
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
associated through the a matrix with

289
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
your observations of temperature then

290
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
you will be changing your observations

291
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
and then just like mike said that is

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
reflected

293
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,880
based upon the expectations that the

294
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
individual has about the observations of

295
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
temperature so

296
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
they're both changing because the hidden

297
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,480
states and the observations are linked

298
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
that's what it means to have a

299
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
generative model

300
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,560
um

301
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,760
or for there to be a partially

302
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,079
observable model with hidden states and

303
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,680
observables

304
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,399
hierarchical models a given state could

305
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
be in emission from a higher state and

306
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,680
emitting a lower state and that's kind

307
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
of like how the current moment is like a

308
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,839
consequence of the past but it's a cause

309
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,760
of the future so this is related to

310
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
bayesian modeling but using this

311
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
architecture

312
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,399
we can say that policy intervenes only

313
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,560
in between hidden states we don't

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
directly intervene in how observations

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,360
appear

316
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
any other thoughts or questions on this

317
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,359
question

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
okay

319
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
all right

320
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,519
in figure 2.2

321
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,839
figure 2.2

322
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
they write

323
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
x star and x so that's going to be

324
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,839
generative process and generative model

325
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,000
latent variables hidden states do not

326
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
necessarily live in the same space of

327
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
measurement

328
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
it might be the

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
case that hidden states in the external

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
world take on values that lie outside

331
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
the space of explanations available to

332
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
the brain

333
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
conversely it might be that the brain's

334
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
explanations include variables that do

335
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
not exist in the outside world

336
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,440
for example the former could be

337
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
5-dimensional and the latter

338
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
two-dimensional or one could be

339
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
continuous and the other could be

340
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
categorical

341
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
so

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
what are examples people can think of

343
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,959
where the dimensionality

344
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
of the generative model

345
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
the cognitive entity

346
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
is the same as the generative process

347
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
the niche process giving rise to

348
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
observations passing them to the

349
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
generative model

350
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,639
that's one question

351
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
second question how does this approach

352
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
or framing

353
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
speak

354
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
to

355
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
the map territory debate

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
hashtag instrumentalism and realism

357
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
what papers or live streams best

358
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
characterize how active inference models

359
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,600
the action cognition perception loop

360
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
and what other possibilities

361
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
or models are there for the action

362
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
cognition perception loop

363
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,920
what would be the different strengths

364
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
and limitations of these different

365
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
framings and partitionings

366
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
thanks um joe and then blue and then

367
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,519
anyone else who raises their hand

368
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
so i was thinking i mean a nice case

369
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,040
where you could say

370
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,760
dimensionality is pretty obvious is uh

371
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
board games about trying to anticipate

372
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
what my opponent is going to play in a

373
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,120
board game

374
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
uh

375
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,079
you know they have a limited number of

376
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
possible moves and

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
i'm assuming i'm playing the same game

378
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,399
i'm expecting them to make some moves on

379
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,240
the same board so

380
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,279
to me that sounds like the

381
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,959
dimensionality of the thing

382
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,880
uh because you're in this like limited

383
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
world you know i don't have to know what

384
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,959
they're thinking i don't know if you

385
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
know what they had for breakfast i don't

386
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,839
have to know

387
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
a lot of stuff i'm just thinking and i

388
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
might be wrong

389
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,279
but moving

390
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
great thanks for that

391
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,839
um

392
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,079
so with the same dimensionality it's

393
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,440
like if we're playing the same game

394
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
then um we're playing a game where we're

395
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,639
tracking a little cursor on the screen

396
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
the movement space within that is just

397
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
the x and the y value or just two

398
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,360
dimensions and so

399
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
um

400
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,480
the observation is like

401
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,399
the location in two dimensions

402
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
and then

403
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,720
that is um the same dimensionality that

404
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,959
inference is occurring on

405
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
but but it's certainly i'm thinking just

406
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,079
to add a little bit more of my comment

407
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,839
if i wanted to enrich it and say oh but

408
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,720
you know i'm starting to think

409
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,399
strategically and anticipating their

410
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,240
next move or anticipating maybe they're

411
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
bluffing or maybe i'm bluffing and i

412
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,760
want to see if they know that i'm

413
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
bluffing we add more dimensionality and

414
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
i guess in principle

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,959
again you could still have that

416
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,040
dimensionality

417
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,920
in in in somehow in parity with parts of

418
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
the hidden

419
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,959
states you know you should i mean that

420
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,480
i'm thinking oh they think they know i'm

421
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
bluffing or

422
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,120
um

423
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,959
i think they're bluffing you're talking

424
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
again about the same thing you don't

425
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,160
have to know what they had for breakfast

426
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
you're just talking about this extra

427
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
information which isn't in the board

428
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
itself but that gets a bit more

429
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,639
complicated

430
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,160
yes

431
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,240
thanks

432
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,880
so um

433
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
that is good answer other ones that

434
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,440
people have written um

435
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
thermostat

436
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,839
is having the same dimensionality like

437
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
it's a temperature value it's a

438
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
dimensionality of one

439
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
and so then the person's

440
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
generative model

441
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
is also on this one-dimensional

442
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
temperature axis

443
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
and then they mentioned that it could be

444
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,759
like categorical um versus continuous

445
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,759
without going too many rabbit holes deep

446
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,120
we could just say temperature in the

447
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
room is a continuous variable it's like

448
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,199
taking on a number it could be a decimal

449
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
point number between

450
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,839
any number

451
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
zero to infinity

452
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
um

453
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,959
the person's model

454
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
might be the same dimensionality like

455
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,560
one

456
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,480
but then they might be trying to make a

457
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,440
categorical estimate is this livable or

458
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,639
unlivable is it hot neutral or cold

459
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
that'd be like a three-state categorical

460
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,360
model

461
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
so the generative process

462
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
doesn't have to have the same

463
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
dimensionality or continuous versus

464
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,399
discreteness of the generative

465
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,398
model

466
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,520
second answer for same dimensionality

467
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
controls for a car have two degrees

468
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,359
physical degrees of freedom

469
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
the acceleration the speed whether you

470
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,400
can hit the gas or the brake and the

471
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
direction of the front wheels controlled

472
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
by the steering wheel

473
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
so there's like a speed dimension

474
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
and then there's a turning angle

475
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,559
dimension

476
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
this is the model that people use when

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,200
controlling a car at some level of

478
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
abstraction

479
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,039
and then the acceleration dimension

480
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,320
can be

481
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,400
acted upon

482
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
through policy selections

483
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,320
like stepping on the gas and the brakes

484
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,840
and then it's like well those are two

485
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
categorically different affordances and

486
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
then there's

487
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
continuous variables inside of that

488
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
categorical difference and we'll talk

489
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,600
about like hybrid control models with

490
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,559
both

491
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,440
categorical and continuous aspects

492
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,520
in play

493
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
and in this case like the speed of the

494
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
car in the speed axis is the hidden

495
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
state

496
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,799
the observable would be the speedometer

497
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,520
so that again the gas and the brake are

498
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,880
policy selections that modify let's say

499
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,039
we're thinking about a train no turning

500
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
policy selection

501
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
is influencing

502
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,000
how speed changes through time

503
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
and if you have a speedometer that's

504
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,400
accurate

505
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
even if it's noisy it's giving rise to

506
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
observations reflecting those changes in

507
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
speed

508
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,320
but gas and break do not change

509
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
the speedometer directly they're

510
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
changing a hidden cause which is the

511
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
speed

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
different dimensionality

513
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
rain comes from clouds simple mental

514
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
models that the darker the clouds the

515
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,880
more they will be

516
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
that's a two-dimensional generative

517
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
model

518
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,480
so

519
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
how much rain

520
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,679
how dark the clouds

521
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,520
and this also is going to speak to this

522
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,679
map territory

523
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,039
some could say well there's the size of

524
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,160
the cloud

525
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,400
and there's also the humidity so that's

526
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,039
like maps with increasing amounts of

527
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
variables

528
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,280
so no one's denying the territory of the

529
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
actual chaos of the cloud

530
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
it's just a question of how much detail

531
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,679
and what data we're actually treating as

532
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,200
observables

533
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
and

534
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
what sophistication is being taken with

535
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
unobserved variables with hidden states

536
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,480
which are modeled

537
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,799
in the computer or on paper but they're

538
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
not directly observed

539
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
then the mental model can be decomposed

540
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,640
even more

541
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
and then

542
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
add infant item

543
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
on the reality side

544
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
the actual

545
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,039
generative process

546
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,520
for weather is

547
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,799
including all the butterflies

548
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,160
so that's

549
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
a cognitive model

550
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,760
that is two-dimensional in this case how

551
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,440
much rain is expected and how dark is

552
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
the cloud

553
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
that one could make increasingly nuanced

554
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
cognitive models

555
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,360
but

556
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,520
whatever cognitive model is being

557
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
proposed

558
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
the generative process is something

559
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,640
that's like totally different cognitive

560
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,679
model generative model map

561
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,240
generative process niche territory

562
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
plants do better when they have water

563
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
and fertilizer

564
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,039
generative mental model leaf droopiness

565
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
is a sign of moisture but leaf size and

566
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,840
color are signs for nutrients

567
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
so one could imagine like a causal graph

568
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,159
where there's like moisture level is

569
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,520
unobserved

570
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,320
but it is emitting leaf droopiness as a

571
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
state

572
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,640
we're observing leaf drippiness and

573
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
we're using that to infer moisture

574
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,400
whereas nutrient is an unobserved state

575
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,559
to the visual gardener

576
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,240
and then they're using two dimensions

577
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,760
leaf size and color so this is a

578
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
three-dimensional cognitive model leaf

579
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,240
droopiness leaf size and color are

580
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
observables

581
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,760
and then there's um two

582
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,200
unobserved cognitive states nutrients

583
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,760
and moisture

584
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
but whatever map gets constructed that's

585
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
not the plant now the gardener might

586
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
then want to take an informative

587
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
experiment

588
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
being an optimal bayesian gardener and

589
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
then measure something take something

590
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,159
that was

591
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,799
an unobserved in the initial model and

592
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,960
then measure

593
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
using lidar like using some sort of

594
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,760
sensor to understand and then that would

595
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
make that data point

596
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
an outcome

597
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
related

598
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,760
through some a matrix which we're going

599
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,039
to get to later

600
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,960
of the hidden state being like the true

601
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,039
levels of copper and then if we have an

602
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
accurate test we can start using the

603
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
outcomes of the observed levels of

604
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,159
copper and start

605
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
flushing out our model that way joe

606
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,919
i chucked in a comment uh below i hope

607
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,520
it's showing up uh

608
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,640
just the

609
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,919
other part of the question was asking

610
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
about the map territory

611
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,960
uh debate and and here's from the person

612
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
who kind of came up with that uh

613
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
that dichotomy in the way we we usually

614
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
talk about he says that the map and

615
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,159
territory should have a similar

616
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,280
structure and i think that's really

617
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,039
interesting to think about you know if

618
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,159
i'm making again moves in a board game

619
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,520
i might

620
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,919
you know make a reduction of their

621
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,600
mental state they may not maybe i'm

622
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
playing against the computer for example

623
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
so i don't know that they have a mental

624
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,240
state or maybe i'm playing against um

625
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
a person i happen to know as the

626
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
beginner so i know they're likely to

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
make naive mistakes or whatever

628
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,480
something like that um but i was just

629
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,840
thinking like with regard to the leaf

630
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
droopiness thing you could have all

631
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,120
kinds of really

632
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,400
badly badly structured uh models of

633
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,760
plant health

634
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
um you know like

635
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
uh maybe relate to how recently you

636
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,039
watered it or something that sounds good

637
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,960
in general but if it's a cactus

638
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
maybe that's maybe that's like a

639
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,919
defeater to your to your system so um

640
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,120
the point being like it seemed

641
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,559
interesting that your map should maybe

642
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,520
if it doesn't have exactly the same

643
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
dimensionality should still be a nice

644
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,880
reduction of the of the thing you're

645
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,760
trying to model whatever that means

646
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,080
thanks

647
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,440
one

648
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
aspect on this is

649
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,799
evolution natural selection dissipation

650
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,320
in our world sweeping off the table

651
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
entities that are failing to at least be

652
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,760
adequate

653
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
so

654
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,159
in a dissipative situation that we're in

655
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,280
the map has to be at least good enough

656
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
otherwise the entity will fail to exist

657
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
so that sort of closes the loop

658
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,200
and

659
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,360
is like we're seeing the persistent

660
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,159
entities that are acting good enough to

661
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,279
navigate

662
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,840
um and it's just interesting like how

663
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
many

664
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240
from the allegory of the cave to the the

665
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,159
blind people and the elephant and

666
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,000
realism instrumentalism

667
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,960
and we've had many live streams

668
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,559
uh on this

669
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,600
especially check out number 14 on mel

670
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
andrews paper the math is not the

671
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
territory

672
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
so this one sort of explicitly jumps in

673
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,960
right there and tackles this issue with

674
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
the fep front and center so this is a

675
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,799
great series of live streams um the dot

676
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,840
zeros

677
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
are background in context where we just

678
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,799
go over the paper in a small group like

679
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,679
one person or two or three people

680
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,159
and then the dot one of the dot two we

681
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,360
usually have more of an open

682
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,919
participatory discussion and the authors

683
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,080
sometimes to usually join so everybody's

684
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,679
welcome to participate

685
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,919
in contributing to dot zeros

686
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,360
as well as enjoying the dot one of the

687
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,039
dot two but just so you know when you're

688
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,080
looking

689
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
in the live stream table

690
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,640
um the dot zero is a good one to watch

691
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,600
first

692
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
because it has like the background and

693
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
overview on the paper but then like

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,840
yesterday in

695
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,880
45.1 we had fristen and par join

696
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
to discuss just so that people can

697
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,919
navigate the live streams a little

698
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,720
better

699
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
um so we can continue

700
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,520
um asynchronously adding more

701
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
uh

702
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,559
thoughts on like map territory and what

703
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
papers and live streams and what are the

704
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,320
possibilities for the action perception

705
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
loop but this is these are big

706
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,039
fun

707
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,559
areas but we're going to continue with

708
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
the questions

709
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
on the notion of surprise

710
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,360
is the agent's

711
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
perception not only affected by the

712
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
influence

713
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,279
of not only its environment but also an

714
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,799
agent's peers

715
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,960
so perhaps three state is in how is an

716
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,400
agent's perception

717
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
affected by its direct perception and

718
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,200
its assessment of peers

719
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,440
so the agent's peers are updating their

720
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,880
beliefs in a collaborative fashion

721
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,200
what would be the extent

722
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
of the update to an agent's generative

723
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,559
model of perception if the agent

724
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
witnesses the annihilation of one of its

725
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,320
peers for example

726
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,039
something like this

727
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,400
okay

728
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
wildebeest from bird box not gonna open

729
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,720
any video links but perhaps we'll

730
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,279
observe some annihilation like some

731
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
animal attacks one of the wild beasts on

732
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,080
the right but then like the other one

733
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,960
learns

734
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,919
so

735
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,159
this is a great video definitely good to

736
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,039
watch

737
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
um

738
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,279
so far in the textbook

739
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,080
and indeed for the textbook it's

740
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
focusing on

741
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,960
just like we saw in figure 2 2 it's like

742
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
one entity

743
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
in the niche

744
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
the niche can consist of others like me

745
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,039
other entities that i expect are similar

746
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
to myself in terms of like the

747
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
coarse-grained cognitive architecture

748
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
they have or their preferences their

749
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,039
affordances they're able to do similar

750
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
things they want similar things they

751
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,640
have a similar history

752
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
to some extent

753
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,640
so

754
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,520
um

755
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,880
that is sometimes called thinking

756
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,679
through other minds ttom

757
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,120
and just to give one thought and then

758
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,039
anyone can raise their hand

759
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,840
um

760
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
if we were to accurately observe

761
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
an agent

762
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,360
another peer

763
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,760
taking some action and then failing to

764
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,080
exist we're driving on the highway and

765
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,559
then we observe somebody taking a policy

766
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
to go off the highway and then we see

767
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,399
them fail to exist

768
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,120
we could use that information

769
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
to update

770
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,159
our

771
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,520
beliefs

772
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
about the consequences of the action to

773
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,799
drive off the highway

774
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,279
so

775
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
i believe it would be possible

776
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
to

777
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,520
implement every variation of

778
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,919
direct perception direct perception of

779
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,440
peers thinking through other minds

780
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
theory of mind

781
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
learning by example

782
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,679
imitation contrarianism

783
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,480
every phenomena could be modeled as just

784
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,760
has to be

785
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,279
whatever the specific

786
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,520
um

787
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,039
model is actually about ali

788
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
i have a related question about

789
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
2.5 and 2.6 uh well uh correct me if i'm

790
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
wrong but uh

791
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,440
i understand that these equations uh

792
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
describe a kind of

793
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,799
uh

794
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,039
describe the behavior of a kind of

795
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,760
rational behavior the kind of behavior

796
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
of a rational agent

797
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,880
uh where does irrationality comes into

798
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
this um

799
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,840
or

800
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
let me put it this way

801
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,679
can irration can irrationality be a

802
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,840
parameter uh

803
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,399
in order to qualify these two equations

804
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,159
2.5 and 2.6 or seen

805
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:54,960
from

806
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
the other side

807
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
can we use these two equations uh to

808
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,679
measure the extent of rationality

809
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,640
as a

810
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,840
measurement of rationality

811
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
good question

812
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
here's one quote and we'll come to

813
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,000
equation 2.5 and 6 as well because those

814
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,559
are important

815
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,200
distinguishing the generative model and

816
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,960
the generative process is really

817
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,320
important

818
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
that's the difference between the entity

819
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,880
and the niche it's important to

820
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
distinguish them to contextualize

821
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,000
psychological claims about the

822
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,399
optimality of inference

823
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,159
to the extent these claims are valid on

824
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,159
a bayesian view is always contingent on

825
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,919
the organism's resource

826
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,600
so

827
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
don't want to step out too far but

828
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,960
rationy rationality and irrationality

829
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,799
it's rational to believe in x it is

830
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
irrational to believe in x is always

831
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,080
subjective from that speaker's

832
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
perspective

833
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
given the priors and the update rules

834
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
all there is is rationality which is to

835
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,039
say this is just the bayesian updating

836
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,039
process so there are maladaptive priors

837
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,399
ones that

838
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,640
trend towards dissolution of the entity

839
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,559
but there aren't irrational priors

840
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,159
there's just is what it is and how it

841
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,120
updates and then that could be

842
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,720
inadequate

843
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,120
um it could be any number of other

844
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
things and these are like getting into

845
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,520
relatively complex cognitive phenomena

846
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,080
um where there could be like

847
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,880
multiple layered models

848
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,279
but um

849
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,799
i would say

850
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,919
rationality in the base process is like

851
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
the cognition is bayes optimal or

852
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,799
modeled with a bayesian process

853
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,120
and then sometimes the interaction of

854
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
the generative model and the generative

855
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,120
process as appropriately defined

856
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
specifically

857
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,640
is going to result in what it results in

858
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
so if

859
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
but let's we will come to 2.5 and 2.6

860
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,519
but okay here suffice to say

861
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,480
yes

862
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,399
social learning and collective behavior

863
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,760
and emergent

864
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,480
uh

865
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,399
outcomes at the group level is something

866
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,600
that's important but we haven't

867
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
addressed it so far in the textbook

868
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,919
and multi-asian models are not really

869
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,600
addressed in the textbook that much

870
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
because there's so much to understand

871
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
about the kernel of the perception

872
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,600
cognition action loop

873
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,720
that

874
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
even though it's so important for real

875
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
systems

876
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,880
it's not brought up

877
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
okay

878
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
wanting to go to the

879
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
um equation

880
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,440
ah the dark room problem for many years

881
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,840
many papes firing back and forth

882
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,840
but let's go to the um equations for our

883
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,120
let me check the chat here yes

884
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
okay

885
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,039
variational free energy is minimized

886
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,720
through two different possible

887
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,919
approaches

888
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,000
minimizing divergence

889
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,919
of q and p changing mind

890
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,840
and maximizing evidence

891
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,159
taking action changing perception this

892
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,039
is done based upon prior and present

893
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,600
information

894
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,760
equation 2.5

895
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,240
variational free energy

896
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,519
to plan

897
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
best actions generative models and

898
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,519
internal policies produce simulated

899
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,159
outcomes that can be used to estimate

900
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,919
expected free energy as the average of

901
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,960
the log probability of outcomes

902
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
equation

903
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,640
2.6 expected free energy

904
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,399
and there's other variants

905
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,559
in the context of planning planning as

906
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,919
inference

907
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,799
equation 2.6 provides a view of efe that

908
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,720
establishes consistency in measurement

909
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
units of exploration exploitation

910
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
the relative balance between these terms

911
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,919
determines whether behavior is

912
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,679
predominantly explorative or

913
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,440
exploitative

914
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,440
34.

915
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,240
in other words dissolving the classic

916
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,320
explore exploit dilemma in behavioral

917
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,799
psychology

918
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,919
what causes this balance to change i.e

919
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,120
what controls this balance very

920
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,879
important and interesting question

921
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,240
perhaps we can come to equation 2.5

922
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
first and then we can come to equation

923
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,919
2.6

924
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,960
so

925
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,200
um where we're going

926
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
is the future

927
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,480
the future has several sources of in

928
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
principle and in practice uncertainty

929
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,679
observations in the future have not

930
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,880
happened

931
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,360
actions in the future have not happened

932
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,519
and the causes

933
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,320
of future outcomes and hidden states

934
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,000
actions as well as the generative

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,799
processes endogenous changes haven't

936
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,559
occurred so there's several like

937
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,600
fundamental and in practice

938
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,199
limitations of

939
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,879
the kind of precision that you can get

940
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,679
on the future

941
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,359
that's planning as inference it's

942
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,760
prospective

943
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,839
in

944
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,679
contrast very and that's expected free

945
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,280
energy because it's about the free

946
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,040
energy of an expected future

947
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,560
variational free energy f and expected

948
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,280
free energy is g

949
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,520
variational free energy f is in equation

950
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,960
2.5

951
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,199
variational free energy as the question

952
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,000
says

953
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
is based upon present and prior

954
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,440
information

955
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,800
so variational free energy is like

956
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,719
now casting

957
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,719
and

958
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,960
verging into something kind of like

959
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,239
memory as inference we're integrating

960
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,599
the past

961
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,240
in the sense of our priors

962
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,960
and the present incoming data point y

963
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
and it's like a snapshot

964
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,400
evaluation of optimal perception

965
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,880
in the purely sensory case

966
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,280
and if we include action within

967
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,240
variational free energy it's taking

968
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,520
one-step optimal actions

969
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,280
but those are not necessarily like the

970
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,040
ones that that's not planning that's

971
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,680
just like snapshot decision making

972
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,079
in contrast 2.6

973
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,880
will explicitly consider

974
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,839
um

975
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,680
policies it is a function of policy pi

976
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,079
and so it is including planning as

977
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,400
inference but first let's look at 2.5

978
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,560
um

979
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,720
jakob or anyone else

980
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,599
would you like to just describe

981
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,119
one pass

982
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,839
what is equation 2.5 showing

983
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
um

984
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,359
i guess if you mean uh like describing

985
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,599
say the first line or the lines in a bit

986
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,960
more detail

987
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
essentially it's the

988
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
um

989
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,599
so the

990
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,160
the energy term is just the expectation

991
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
of

992
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,240
the log of the joint probability of the

993
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,920
data and

994
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,720
the observation so i think

995
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,760
um

996
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,839
i don't understand quite why they

997
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,880
changed

998
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,839
the notation from appendix b

999
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,640
but

1000
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
why would uh essentially be the s i

1001
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,119
think and x would be the o

1002
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
yes um anyone could be taking more notes

1003
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,000
on this but y is the observable data

1004
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
and x is the hidden state

1005
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
in the pomdp that we're going to be

1006
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,680
getting to later

1007
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
x

1008
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,599
out there the hidden state is s and o

1009
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,079
are observations so this is using more

1010
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,000
of a like regression

1011
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,720
familiar like framework and variable

1012
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,839
notation

1013
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:16,720
but

1014
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,760
this could also be written ln p of

1015
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,359
o comma s observations and states that's

1016
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,200
the joint distribution joint

1017
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
distribution with a comma conditional

1018
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,720
distributions with a vertical pipe

1019
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,599
yeah and so we

1020
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,160
also taking the the entropy term is only

1021
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,280
based on

1022
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,839
the beliefs of our hidden states so

1023
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,800
for your

1024
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,599
how

1025
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,920
um people were saying before that the

1026
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,160
hidden states are unobservable

1027
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,680
the only thing that we can say about the

1028
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,839
hidden states are the belief

1029
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,800
cue

1030
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,119
about the hidden states

1031
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,880
i don't think that the

1032
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,079
hidden states x can ever really appear

1033
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,320
um on their own

1034
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,480
because we always need to have some kind

1035
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,760
of belief about them and

1036
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,520
this was also related to a discussion we

1037
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,599
were having yesterday

1038
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,079
um that's interesting that they

1039
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,680
uh used to

1040
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,760
kind of switch between the notation of

1041
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,119
entropy

1042
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,800
with h

1043
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,839
um

1044
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,160
as the func as the functional

1045
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
uh and the

1046
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,960
and just the pure expectation uh

1047
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
with the e

1048
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,119
because the actual definition of entropy

1049
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,000
is the expectation of the negative log

1050
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,200
of

1051
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,800
whatever is in

1052
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,390
um

1053
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,640
[Music]

1054
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,040
is um is the variable which in this case

1055
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
is q of x

1056
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
uh and that's actually how we get to the

1057
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,240
other

1058
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
to the other two expressions with

1059
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,680
complexity and accuracy and divergence

1060
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,800
and evidence and there's also a link

1061
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,880
i think might be wrong with uh

1062
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,000
that to theoretical physics with

1063
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
um where

1064
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
free energy is essentially

1065
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,800
the kind of cognitive statistical

1066
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,320
equivalent of the lagrangian

1067
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,880
which is defined as kinetic energy minus

1068
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,119
potential energy so we were discussing

1069
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,640
uh yesterday

1070
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,119
what that means in terms of uh the

1071
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,520
energy and entropy in this case whether

1072
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
the energy is

1073
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,400
perhaps

1074
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,630
kind of the immediate um

1075
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,920
[Music]

1076
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,000
cognitive kinetic energy

1077
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
and then the entropy

1078
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
is like the potential energy or vice

1079
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,800
versa

1080
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
[Music]

1081
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,560
might be going off on a tangent at this

1082
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,320
point

1083
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
awesome let me just add in a few other

1084
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
notes

1085
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,480
um the variables

1086
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
f is a function

1087
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,240
it's the variational free energy

1088
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,359
function

1089
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,760
the arguments that it is taking in

1090
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
our q

1091
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,880
that's the variational distribution that

1092
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,320
we control that's what makes it a

1093
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,480
variational free energy

1094
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,040
q is the one that we control

1095
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,680
p is the actual probability distribution

1096
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
out there

1097
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
y is the data point

1098
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
so we have on the left side of the

1099
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
equation

1100
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,960
variational free energy is a function of

1101
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,880
q and y

1102
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
on the right side we have three equal

1103
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,680
signs and these are three

1104
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,800
values

1105
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,119
three ways to phrase this one function

1106
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,599
in the bottom here

1107
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,000
jacob has shown how this energy minus

1108
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
entropy

1109
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
can result in the second line complexity

1110
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,240
minus accuracy

1111
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,319
and in the third line divergence minus

1112
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,440
evidence

1113
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,599
so that was like one really

1114
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,680
interesting thing is it's not like this

1115
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,520
is how it is and this is a

1116
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,720
transformation and then this is the

1117
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
transformation it

1118
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,359
even in a sense that is also true it is

1119
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,040
also probably helpful to think about

1120
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
this

1121
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,640
energy minus entropy formalism for what

1122
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
it is

1123
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,480
which is the closest to a physics

1124
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,520
framing

1125
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,200
of free energy

1126
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,680
and then think about these two more

1127
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
statistical

1128
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,560
ontology

1129
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,640
ways of framing it complexity minus

1130
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,880
accuracy which is like very commonly

1131
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
brought up in the context of model

1132
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,599
fitting and divergence minus evidence

1133
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,200
also

1134
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,079
um

1135
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,720
and yeah great so blue if that sounds

1136
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,520
like a very helpful norm

1137
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,880
in the description

1138
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,960
we'll try to have like a description of

1139
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,480
the equation

1140
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,880
the first row says this this this this

1141
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,400
this

1142
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,160
people can type it however they want and

1143
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,640
then of course we can replace

1144
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,640
terms that are in the ontology

1145
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
with

1146
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,440
the special at sign

1147
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,680
and that will facilitate

1148
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,599
finding equations that mention those

1149
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,640
terms

1150
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,720
and it will facilitate translating these

1151
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,839
equations

1152
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,720
and

1153
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,480
also the descriptions into different

1154
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,400
languages computer languages and human

1155
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,839
languages

1156
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,920
so then we can work on it in this

1157
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,000
ontological space

1158
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
and then make sure that it's accessible

1159
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,160
to different languages for example

1160
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,040
um

1161
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
then we thought about this example of

1162
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,800
like

1163
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,560
uh a ball

1164
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,200
and its location in a bowl

1165
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,319
so

1166
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,720
there's a true location of where it is

1167
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,240
in the bowl

1168
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,040
x

1169
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,119
and then there's an observation

1170
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,839
of where we're observing the ball to be

1171
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,599
so

1172
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,200
and this also speaks to the quantum to

1173
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,960
classical handoff

1174
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,400
if the bowl is a swimming pool and the

1175
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
ball is a bowling ball

1176
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
after enough time it's going to be at

1177
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,880
the bottom and not moving

1178
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,839
if

1179
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,760
the bowl is like a molecular well

1180
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,680
and the ball is like

1181
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,280
an electron or like one atom

1182
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,200
then repeated measurement is going to be

1183
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,760
entirely different and as the

1184
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
ball and the ball become more massive

1185
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,480
it approaches like a classical limit

1186
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,520
little hints at the continuity between

1187
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,800
classical

1188
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,079
statistical

1189
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,599
and quantum and thermo physics um but we

1190
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,960
thought about this ball being in the

1191
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,079
bowl

1192
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:22,960
so

1193
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,000
um

1194
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,040
we looked at two different cases

1195
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,359
which is when the ball is being observed

1196
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,040
in the bottom of the bowl

1197
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,240
it's like

1198
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,200
given the generative model of the shape

1199
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,160
of the bowl and gravity

1200
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,480
um which is like a potential energy

1201
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,839
function

1202
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,520
observing the ball at the center of the

1203
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,760
bowl is like strictly the most likely

1204
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,839
thing that could have happened

1205
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,839
and then observing it up on a side is

1206
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,839
like a less likely observation

1207
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,839
um eric and then blue

1208
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,640
i

1209
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,000
see uh yeah um i so it you mentioned

1210
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,480
that uh f is a function and and as they

1211
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,359
put it it's a function of a function

1212
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,000
which is a functional so the way i think

1213
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,079
about this is that

1214
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,640
the function that it's a function of

1215
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,440
is the q so the q is a distribution over

1216
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,720
your beliefs

1217
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,319
so i think of that as being a function

1218
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,520
that you're trying to optimize you're

1219
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,680
trying to say well how do i figure how

1220
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,760
do i adjust my internal

1221
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,480
belief state the q

1222
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,800
and that's what i'm optimizing

1223
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
in this equation and the functional says

1224
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,240
that's what i'm trying to optimize is

1225
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
that function and distribution and then

1226
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,640
it breaks down into the two parts which

1227
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,359
is

1228
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,839
your your generative model p which says

1229
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,800
well

1230
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,920
um

1231
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,400
p says for any

1232
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,760
there's the joint probability of x

1233
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,480
x is the the internal state

1234
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
um

1235
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,760
variable that you have a distribution

1236
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,359
over that's q

1237
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,560
and so how do your observables and your

1238
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,800
internal states go together and then you

1239
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
have the entropy term which is well you

1240
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,240
want to have

1241
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
maximum uncertainty so that if you're

1242
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,520
not constrained by your observations you

1243
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,400
want to be as agnostic as possible about

1244
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,480
what the possible values are of your

1245
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,200
internal states or make that q as flat

1246
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,440
as possible

1247
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,640
as flat as possible under the

1248
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,760
constraints of the observations going

1249
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,839
through your generative model p

1250
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,280
so i guess that's the way i talk through

1251
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,280
this this first line awesome thank you

1252
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,720
eric blue and then brock

1253
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,119
so eric that was super helpful um i've

1254
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,800
been like since yesterday trying to

1255
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,680
figure out what exactly is meant by q

1256
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,560
here

1257
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,480
like i get like later on we're going to

1258
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,000
talk about q as representing beliefs but

1259
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,880
in like as it's given as it's laid out

1260
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,359
in chapter two like they don't actually

1261
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,640
define q

1262
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,560
at all

1263
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,359
um

1264
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,560
so i am like having a hard time up here

1265
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,240
like they describe it

1266
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,480
much like right before they get into

1267
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,839
that box

1268
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,119
they describe q in section 2.6 as an

1269
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,440
approximate posterior

1270
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,720
so

1271
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,400
approximate posterior of what and like

1272
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,760
should we

1273
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,599
denote q as the function of beliefs here

1274
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,800
even though

1275
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,640
like there's it's like they're skipping

1276
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
ahead and looping back at the same time

1277
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,240
it seems like or it feels like to me

1278
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,400
q is the variational distribution where

1279
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
the form of the posterior has been

1280
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,680
chosen

1281
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,160
so exact base

1282
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,040
using matrix multiplication basically or

1283
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,520
sampling based approaches to approximate

1284
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,000
bayesian computation like monte carlo

1285
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,680
markov chain

1286
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,560
those try to recapitulate the actual

1287
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,800
form of p

1288
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
so if p is truly bimodal then exact base

1289
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,720
or sampling based approaches would try

1290
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,520
to reconstruct that distribution

1291
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,160
in contrast the variational approach

1292
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,079
gains tractability because you're

1293
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,319
choosing a posterior approximate

1294
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,079
posterior cue

1295
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,480
of a form that you know is going to have

1296
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,040
a tractable optimization scheme and

1297
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,359
there's message passing algorithms

1298
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,000
that can do it computationally so if you

1299
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,480
choose q to be a gaussian then

1300
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,079
depending on how you parameterize it

1301
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,160
it's either going to like be seeking the

1302
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,319
mode and go to the hump that's bigger

1303
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,559
and center around that with a variance

1304
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,280
or it'll just spread out a lot and go

1305
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,119
over and try to cover as much

1306
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,720
probability density as it can by

1307
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,119
covering both humps

1308
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,880
okay so the variational free energy

1309
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,160
function f as a function of the function

1310
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,480
representing the approximate posterior q

1311
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,000
and the data y

1312
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,800
is equal to the negative expectation of

1313
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,680
q given the observations x times the

1314
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,359
natural log of the probability of the

1315
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,440
joint distribution of the data and

1316
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,040
observations is that the english

1317
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,400
translation of that equation i think i

1318
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,520
got it finally after like two days

1319
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,119
minus close

1320
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,440
close i would say you one one thing i

1321
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,880
would say slightly different

1322
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,160
it's the expectation over q not

1323
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,118
expectation of q

1324
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,680
we actually talked about that um a

1325
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,520
little bit like here we had negative

1326
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,200
expectation over q

1327
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,359
oh and

1328
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,598
yes

1329
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,680
um okay

1330
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,319
blue then yeah sorry the ontology terms

1331
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,160
like don't match the terms that are

1332
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,839
given in the book and i i put in a

1333
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,920
request in the questions here if we can

1334
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
append the ontology because they use

1335
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,440
like data

1336
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,520
is the same as like

1337
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,319
um

1338
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,200
observations

1339
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,079
those are different words but there's

1340
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,640
they're similar

1341
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,040
like yeah there's a lot of of synonyms

1342
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,280
or synonymous use and so like i would

1343
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,599
hate to step on them or but like also

1344
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,880
the terms aren't

1345
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,760
um

1346
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,520
in the ontology at all so maybe we

1347
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,200
should update the ontology to reflect

1348
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,640
the terms

1349
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,880
we will absolutely add terms into the

1350
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,319
supplemental or

1351
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,480
eventually into the core terms if that's

1352
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,880
required but just

1353
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
leave a comment or email active

1354
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,280
inference at gmail to add terms to the

1355
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,720
ontology if there's a term that you want

1356
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,599
to tag that's not being tagged

1357
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,920
brock

1358
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,559
i feel like you may have indirectly

1359
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,559
answered this just now but um

1360
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,200
it's in the math discussion yesterday we

1361
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,640
were talking about

1362
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
specifically about the cube the

1363
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,440
distribution of beliefs um over the yeah

1364
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,839
like

1365
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,440
if x is this uncertainty term this

1366
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,119
um

1367
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,400
hidden state like

1368
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,400
what

1369
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,160
what value could it possibly have where

1370
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,240
is it coming from

1371
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,079
or is that

1372
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,480
so q is this property of distribution of

1373
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,440
beliefs is x the belief

1374
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,119
value and that's being generated

1375
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,319
in the previous step

1376
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,319
i think

1377
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,079
we in the bowl

1378
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,240
marble thing we

1379
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,960
like my question was uh

1380
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,280
or i was just pointing out i guess that

1381
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,040
you know the hidden state is changing

1382
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,160
however it wants um perhaps below our

1383
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,520
threshold of observation

1384
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,520
that's not reflected in the equation for

1385
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,760
obvious reasons and so but but then

1386
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,200
where you know maybe it crosses a

1387
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,880
threshold and then we update or whatever

1388
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,640
but but where is that

1389
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,280
x coming from if it's a hidden state

1390
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,319
you see what i'm saying is that kind of

1391
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,160
an ontological problem there i'm trying

1392
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,359
to solve for it's like it's a hidden

1393
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,720
state how can have a value or be a

1394
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,200
variable if it's hidden

1395
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,319
it's a

1396
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,880
yes eric

1397
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,640
i'll take a stab at that

1398
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,319
so as i as shown in the pictures there's

1399
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,240
two hidden states

1400
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,200
there's a hidden state of the real world

1401
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,880
and then there's a hidden state of your

1402
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,520
generative model

1403
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,040
and the general model is whatever the

1404
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,640
model is and that's however the model

1405
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,160
was built so once you have the

1406
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,760
parameters x

1407
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,280
then that's what you're working with

1408
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,000
until you change your model

1409
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,520
so that was my

1410
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,720
habitat

1411
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,599
yes

1412
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,680
and over evolutionary or developmental

1413
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,440
times

1414
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,359
you get swept off the table if there is

1415
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,359
inadequacy at least

1416
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,359
but in a simulation environment you

1417
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,160
could

1418
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,200
make the x and x star to be anything but

1419
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,240
um

1420
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,400
the hidden state is as modeled by the

1421
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,160
generative model of the cognitive entity

1422
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,119
so

1423
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,800
in the cognitive model of the entity in

1424
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,040
the bowl example they're they're

1425
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,960
modeling an unobservable which is the

1426
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,720
location of the ball

1427
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,040
and they're modeling an observable which

1428
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,920
is the observation of location

1429
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,599
so both of those are in the generative

1430
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,559
model

1431
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,920
and then the generative process would be

1432
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,119
like there's somebody with a magnet

1433
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,319
who's moving the ball around or

1434
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,000
something or it could be anything

1435
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,839
um

1436
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,920
we're going to have five more minutes

1437
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,960
before we close this session

1438
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,559
so

1439
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,280
what does anyone see in 2.4

1440
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,319
what is

1441
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,599
free energy

1442
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,520
minimization doing

1443
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,040
and what does it mean that variational

1444
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,960
free energy is an upper bound on the

1445
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,760
negative log evidence

1446
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,280
just one quick qualitative read

1447
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,119
is that this is what we would actually

1448
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,520
like to be minimizing this is the floor

1449
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,920
we truly want to reach would be

1450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,520
unsurprised

1451
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,480
about observations

1452
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,680
however

1453
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,640
that

1454
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,480
is intractable because we don't have

1455
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,319
access to the form or the

1456
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,720
parameterization of the true generative

1457
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,680
process

1458
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,760
what is a tractable approximation

1459
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
approximate bayesian computation

1460
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,040
is variational bayesian inference so

1461
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,599
here's f q of y

1462
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,880
q and y

1463
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,880
and then this is a kl divergence

1464
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,160
one vertical pipe means conditioned on

1465
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,640
like x conditioned on y x given y here

1466
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,480
probability of a hidden state being the

1467
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,640
case given a data

1468
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,480
or the other flipping which would be the

1469
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,559
probability of a given data point given

1470
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,839
a hidden state

1471
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,000
two vertical lines is in divergence

1472
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,040
notation

1473
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,240
and that's the divergence between this

1474
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,599
and that

1475
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,319
between q of x and between p of x given

1476
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,599
y

1477
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,559
so

1478
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,599
that

1479
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,599
reducing this divergence

1480
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,680
which has very nice properties in terms

1481
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,960
of its

1482
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,720
implementation

1483
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,800
is bringing us to lower our upper bounds

1484
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,680
on what we really want to be minimizing

1485
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,480
in a tractable way so that's one aspect

1486
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,640
on free energy minimization

1487
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,559
and then um

1488
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,119
here is reframing the two ways that free

1489
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,800
energy variational free energy can be

1490
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,000
minimized

1491
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,599
through perception

1492
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,160
the updating of beliefs and we'll talk

1493
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,920
more about the continuity between like

1494
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,599
perception and learning

1495
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,000
like if one observes the ball moving

1496
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,680
across the visual field is that

1497
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,559
perception or is it parameter learning

1498
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,720
updating the location of the ball that

1499
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
depends on the time scale and such

1500
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,960
or action can be taken

1501
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,040
so that the expected observations are

1502
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,160
changed to maximize evidence

1503
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,599
and then

1504
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,480
in the last minutes

1505
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,680
ali asked

1506
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,319
can a hidden state be an unquantifiable

1507
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,280
quality

1508
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,040
like a qualia quality or like an

1509
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,839
unquantifiable quantity

1510
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,799
no i mean uh well

1511
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,040
of course most qualities can be

1512
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,040
parameterized but

1513
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,920
well

1514
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,119
perhaps

1515
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,920
we can think of a hidden state as a

1516
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,839
pure quality

1517
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,799
that cannot be

1518
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,079
is fundamentally unquantifiable and

1519
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,200
can we we cannot parameterize it i mean

1520
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,118
can we think of such a hidden state

1521
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,319
um

1522
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,680
brock

1523
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,920
i was just going to say the probably the

1524
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,160
quantifiable way to state that question

1525
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,520
is like are there

1526
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,440
intractable

1527
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,359
hidden states which the answer to that

1528
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,839
is like obviously

1529
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,480
yes

1530
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,000
can we get some estimate on it yes

1531
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,240
but then is that

1532
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,880
commensurate with the i you know and

1533
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,040
then does that mean it's a quality and

1534
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,280
not a quantity i don't know

1535
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,359
and also to the earlier discussion about

1536
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,720
like the dimensionality of the

1537
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,079
generative model and the generative

1538
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,720
process the unquantifiable part could be

1539
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,640
like the baby's happiness

1540
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,599
but then

1541
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,160
we're able to still have an inference on

1542
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,640
the happiness as a parameter

1543
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,559
x the underlying state that's giving

1544
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,200
rise to the different sounds

1545
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,240
without

1546
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,440
necessarily knowing like the

1547
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,799
distributional form of happiness but we

1548
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,640
have to have a distributional form for

1549
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,000
the variational approximation of

1550
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,160
happiness joe

1551
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,599
i was just going to say i mean i think

1552
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,480
that this

1553
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,839
qualitative versus quantitative

1554
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,520
distinction is interesting if you're

1555
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,680
thinking about like a light source you

1556
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
know it's a source of electrons well you

1557
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,040
could count the number of electrons but

1558
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,720
whether or not there is a light source

1559
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,119
they're a source of electrons

1560
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,880
in this framework and i'm proposing

1561
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,000
you're not counting that you're just

1562
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,599
saying there is a light source or some

1563
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,280
other dimension the thing we've been

1564
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,880
calling dimensions you know yes you can

1565
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,640
count the number of dimensions

1566
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,839
but given that they're all different

1567
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,280
they're not really relatable to each

1568
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,040
other

1569
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,960
thanks yes very interesting um so

1570
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,960
in our final seconds

1571
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,440
we'll just point towards 2.6

1572
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,799
which is

1573
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,400
expected free energy

1574
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,359
g

1575
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,000
and its prospective which is going to

1576
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,960
enable

1577
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,000
inference

1578
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,200
conditioned on action

1579
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,079
x hidden states the world

1580
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,960
conditioned on policy selection

1581
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,880
and that is what is going to allow

1582
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,280
comparison of different policies which

1583
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,440
are sequences of actions over a given

1584
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,720
time horizon

1585
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,920
so minimizing the divergence

1586
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,559
between two things minus some things

1587
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,160
reframing it as a few things so

1588
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,240
we didn't go as much into 2.6 as we did

1589
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,880
into 2.5 because 2.5 is an important

1590
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,440
precursor and simpler cousin of 2.6

1591
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,799
but it's like super important and we

1592
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,079
especially to those who are here and

1593
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,319
those who are not here we would

1594
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,599
really love over multiple cohorts when

1595
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,359
everybody will hopefully be able to join

1596
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,880
and rejoin as participant as facilitator

1597
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,920
um

1598
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,960
to be able to annotate all the equations

1599
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,480
with what they mean

1600
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,319
because what is there to be said about

1601
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,079
expected free energy

1602
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,400
without some understanding

1603
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,640
of what this is actually discussing what

1604
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,640
variables go in what is it doing how are

1605
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,760
some of them being related so

1606
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,599
we want to learn this and we can do it

1607
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,079
collaboratively if people just

1608
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,640
pick and choose affordances they see

1609
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,559
annotate some things

1610
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,079
and then they can highlight it and say

1611
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,200
i'm not sure about this but i just

1612
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,880
wanted to add it can somebody improve it

1613
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,799
and so on like we're all there to help

1614
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,559
each other learn and improve our

1615
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,160
epistemic niche

1616
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,880
2.6 is expected free energy

1617
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,799
there's further discussion

1618
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,799
on expected free energy

1619
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,480
showing how it's composed of these five

1620
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,520
sections

1621
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,240
and that by like leaving some out

1622
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,359
you get

1623
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,599
different special cases

1624
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,680
that are quite important

1625
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,480
for example leaving out this you get

1626
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,359
this

1627
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,040
leaving out just one you get two three

1628
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,079
four five and so on figure two six

1629
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,640
and then there's a summary of the low

1630
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,319
road to active inference that's chapter

1631
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,119
two

1632
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,720
so this concludes chapter two and our

1633
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,880
discussion in cohort one

1634
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,400
in the coming two weeks we're going to

1635
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,480
be discussing chapter three the high

1636
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,559
road to active inference

1637
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,040
it's going to take another attack

1638
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,200
and we will go through it in the coming

1639
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,520
two weeks and be addressing people's

1640
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,760
questions but hopefully we can continue

1641
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,160
answering and addressing just wherever

1642
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,559
we see fit no one's gonna do it all but

1643
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,520
we do need everybody to do some

1644
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,839
hopefully

1645
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,880
we're going to now close recording we'll

1646
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,680
then take a one minute break and then in

1647
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,680
this room we're going to continue with

1648
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,119
dot tools

1649
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,960
if you want to continue discussing the

1650
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,079
textbook or anything else then head up

1651
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,520
to a room

1652
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,160
up and to the left but in this room in

1653
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,079
one minute we're going to continue with

1654
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,160
dot tools so thanks everybody see you

1655
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,160
soon
