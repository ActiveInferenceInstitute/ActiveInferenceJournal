650	195260	00:00	It is June 2, 2022 and we're in week five of textbook group cohort one. We're having our second discussion on chapter two and we will get right to the questions. The meetings are on 19 UTC on Wednesdays. It's an infinite learning journey for everyone.	The Math learning group meets on 19 UTC on Wednesdays	Comments on the Math Learning Group
197230	321608	03:17	Tune into the chapter two regime of attention upvote any questions that you'd like to see addressed. People can raise their hand or write in the chat at any time. If there's enough interest in people who want to record sessions, we absolutely will do it.	You can upvote any questions you'd like to see addressed	A few thoughts on chapter 2
321694	703670	05:21	Can we actually change hidden states with policy selection? Does anyone want to raise their hand and give a thought on this question? What really changes as a result of policy selection, the hidden states or the outcomes?	Can we actually change hidden states with policy selection	Can we Actually Change Hidden States with Policy Selection?
712070	1322304	11:52	Hidden states do not necessarily live in the same space of measurement. One could be continuous and the other could be categorical. How does this approach speak up to the map territory debate, instrumentalism and realism? What other possibilities or models are there for the action, cognition perception loop?	What are examples where the dimensionality of the generative model is the same	Inference 6, The dimensionality of the generative model
1322422	1521692	22:02	The other part of the question was asking about the map territory debate. Mel Andrew says that the map and territory should have a similar structure. This is a great series of live streams. Everybody's welcome to participate in contributing to dot zeros as well as enjoying the dot one and the dot two.	The other part of the question was asking about the map territory debate	Mathematical map territory debate
1521756	1687640	25:21	Is the agent's perception affected by its direct perception and its assessment of peers? What would be the extent of the update to an agent's generative model of perception if the agent witnesses the annihilation of one of its peers. Every phenomena could be modeled as just has to be whatever the specific model is actually about.	How is an agent's perception affected by its direct perception and assessment of peers	Generative Perception 6, Surprise
1692050	1883660	28:12	Where does irrationality come into this? Can we use these two equations to measure the extent of rationality as a measurement of rationality? Distinguishing the. generative model and the generative process is really important.	Can we use Bayesian equations to measure extent of rationality as a measurement	Rationality and the Bayesian process
1893970	2015510	31:33	Equation 2.6 provides a view of EFE that establishes consistency in measurement units of exploration, exploitation. The relative balance between these terms determines whether behavior is predominantly explorative or exploitative. What causes this balance to change?	Variational free energy determines whether behavior is predominantly explorative or exploitative	In the Dark Room: Variational Free Energy
2015960	2138888	33:35	The future has several sources of, in principle and in practice uncertainty. Actions in the future have not happened and the causes of future outcomes and hidden states actions as well as the generative processes endogenous changes haven't occurred. That's planning as inference, it's prospective in contrast and that's expected free energy.	The future has several sources of uncertainty, in principle and in practice	Planning as Inference with Variational Free Energy
2138984	2640320	35:38	Blue: What is equation 2.5 showing? The energy term is just the expectation of the log of the joint probability of the data and the observation. The entropy term is only based on the beliefs of our hidden states. This will facilitate translating equations into different languages.	Blue: What is equation 2.5 showing	Complexity and accuracy of the Lagrangian
2640930	2732830	44:00	The Q is a distribution over your beliefs. You're trying to say, well, how do I adjust my internal belief state the Q. And then you have the entropy term, which is well, you want to have maximum uncertainty. As flat as possible under the constraints of the observations.	F is a function that you're trying to optimize. So the Q is a distribution over your beliefs	Optimizing the Probability of a Data Set
2732980	2963470	45:32	Eric: I've been trying to figure out what exactly is meant by Q. It's the expectation over Q, not expectation of Q. Brock: The ontology terms don't match the terms that are given in the book. Maybe we should update the ontology to reflect the terms.	Eric blue: I've been trying to figure out what Q is	Bayesian inference: Q and the approximate posterior
2963650	3136778	49:23	The hidden state is as modeled by the generative model of the cognitive entity. How can have a value or be a variable if it's hidden? In a simulation environment, you could make the X and the X star to be anything but.	There's a hidden state of the real world and then there's a generative model	Exploring the Hidden State of Beliefs
3136954	3281250	52:16	Free energy can be minimized through perception, the updating of beliefs. Approximate Bayesian computation is variational Bayesian inference. We'll talk more about the continuity between perception and learning.	Free energy can be minimized through perception or the updating of beliefs	Free Energy Minimization in Bayesian Computation
3282170	3423170	54:42	Can a hidden state be an unquantifiable quality, like a qualia quality or like an unQuantifiable quantity? And then does that mean it's a quality and not a quantity?	Ali asked, can a hidden state be an unquantifiable quality	Can a Hidden State Be an Unquantifiable Quality?
3424100	3586420	57:04	2.6 enables inference conditioned on action x hidden states, the world conditioned on policy selection. We would love over multiple cohorts when everybody will be able to annotate all the equations with what they mean. In the coming two weeks we're going to be discussing chapter three, the High Road to Active Inference.	2.6 is expected free energy g and its prospective	2.6 and the Right Road to Active Inference
3588040	3610990	59:48	In this room in 1 minute we're going to continue with Dot tools. If you want to continue discussing the textbook or anything else, then head up to a room up and to the left. See you soon.	We're going to now close recording. If you want to continue discussing textbook or anything else	Close Recording
