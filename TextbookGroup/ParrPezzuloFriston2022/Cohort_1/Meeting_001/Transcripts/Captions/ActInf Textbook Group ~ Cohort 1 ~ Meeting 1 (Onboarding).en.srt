1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,439
hello everyone thank you for joining

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,880
this is the

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,000
recorded and live onboarding session for

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
the first cohort of

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,360
the active inference textbook group

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
and this

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
session is going to cover

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,279
many of the sections of our coda and

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,840
hopefully resolve your uncertainty about

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
participating in different aspects of

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,000
the textbook group

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
so there will be some presentations but

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,520
also a ton of time for questions so feel

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,680
free to use the chat

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,000
box on the bottom right hand side

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
to add any questions

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,440
um hello welcome

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
feel free to use the chat box on the

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
bottom right side to add any questions

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,239
and also feel free to raise your hands

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,160
and then we'll be able to see that hand

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
raised if you'd like to ask your

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,039
question but also it could be really

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
helpful just to add it in the chat

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
during this presentation so

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
you can click on the screen

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,119
that's being shared to see

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
it zoomed in

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,720
and so

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
you should be able to see my info screen

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
and some clicks

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,680
all right

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,119
so

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,840
welcome everybody to the actin flap

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,600
whether it's your first time

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
participating in

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
actin flab or in anything related to

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
active inference

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,720
welcome hope that this is like

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,640
a space where we can really

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
have some amazing things happen

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,079
this coda

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,680
that we're all looking at and that we

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,240
all have access to is our shared

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,759
epistemic niche and so you can of course

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,399
have your own notes and own documents

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
but this is our shared collaborative

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
niche

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
we are working through the textbook and

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
learning active inference this recent

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
textbook by par pizzulo in fristen

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,719
and by right clicking you can download

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,159
the pdf

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,640
full or the one where the pdf pages and

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
the book pages are aligned

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,320
just in case you wanted to download it

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
and it's also awesome that it's an open

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,399
source textbook

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,400
if you ever have any questions about

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
anything related to participating in

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
the textbook group or in any aspect of

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
actin flab then

63
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,879
activeinference.gmail.com a good email

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,959
address to contact

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,840
okay

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
so i'm gonna in the sidebar go to this

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,519
second one rules and also this sidebar

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,840
can be shown or hidden with the two

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,239
arrows so first we'll go over some of

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,920
the rules

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
and also with the understanding that

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
this is an evolving

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,360
area

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
and it's our first cohort so just

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
super appreciative and it's really

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,319
awesome for those for many different

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
places and stages who have stepped up to

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
engage in this way

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
and

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,680
we stipulate that by engaging with this

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
coda and in the live meetings so not in

82
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
private conversations not in your own

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
private documents but within the shared

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,959
spaces that are synchronous and

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,319
asynchronous that we're creating

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,280
together

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
we're in a participatory open science

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
space

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
and that means that

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
no proprietary or inappropriate

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
information will be shared

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,200
and that

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,080
more positively any ideas and writing

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
and contributions that are shared in

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
this shared coda

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
or during these recorded

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
sessions that we'll have

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,120
these are understood to be

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,159
declared as creative commons ccby

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,120
attribution so state otherwise or don't

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
say it if it's different because that's

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
how it's going to be understood in the

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,239
comments

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
and then of course if somebody's like

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
interested in this area of attribution

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,879
and all of this in in online spaces in

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
participatory communities that's an

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
important area

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,000
during the course of the textbook group

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
we are students

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
so we're interacting here as individuals

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
on the path of learning and applying so

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,400
some of us might be interested in

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
research as well and there will be

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
hopefully a ton of time to connect and

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
find those collaborations but we're

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
going to keep the regime of attention

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
on the learning the familiarity

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
accessibility and competency of active

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
inference as it is in that textbook that

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
doesn't mean it's going to be the only

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
document that we look at other resources

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
are going to come into play but it's

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
about learning

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,479
not research and we're interested in

126
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
this textbook that's what's bringing us

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
together

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,919
and

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,479
please be an engaged learner however

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,720
that means for you so whether you're

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
checking in once in a while

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
and just asking some questions here and

133
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,919
there

134
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,160
adding a comment like by selecting text

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
and then on the right side hitting the

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
add comment

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
whatever that kind of participation

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
looks for you or maybe you're

139
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,720
interested in re-skilling and in three

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
months you'd like to be in a totally

141
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
different position and you're

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
approaching this in a multiple hours per

143
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
day way we just hope that your

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,240
participation is open and authentic and

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
again if you have any questions about it

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
you can email

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
the next page we'll look at is the

148
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,479
directory so the directory has links

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
to the different sections of the coda

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
and anytime you see like a blue

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,199
link with an emoji next to it that's

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,880
something you can click on and go to

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
that page

154
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
so this has just descriptions on what

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
the different pages are

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
and it's what the onboarding is and it's

157
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
also this like an asynchronous

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
onboarding page if something's unclear

159
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
again you could just say i'm not really

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
sure about this

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,919
what does it mean to do dot dot dot

162
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,080
okay so that's kind of the

163
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
preliminaries is just welcoming those

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,479
who are new and returning to actin flab

165
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,440
stating some of the rules and bases for

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
our shared experience and then just

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
describing the structure of this coda

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
the next thing that we're going to talk

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,319
about is the onboarding

170
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
and feel free during this or any time to

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
to add those questions into the

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
chat

173
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
okay so here in the onboarding

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,720
section

175
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
as a participant you have total access

176
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
to the coda and the knowledge base here

177
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
which we're going to be exploring in

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
this session

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
and so we

180
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,280
suggest that especially for those who

181
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
are new to coda they may want to watch

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
this playlist that covers some of the

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
basics of coda and

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
there's also people to ask if you have

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
any questions but it's something like a

186
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,039
cloud document and a wiki because we do

187
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
have a version history

188
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,919
although it's also easy to make edits

189
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,599
and you'll find that some pages are

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
locked like this page cannot be directly

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
edited in the text by a participant

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
however they're able to modify these as

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
many many have already done

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,840
so

195
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
um we're going to talk about like the

196
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
student workspace and student practices

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
and things like that

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,880
and then to

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
help this sort of

200
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
self onboarding that everyone can go

201
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,840
through

202
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
we have several things that you can do

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
and engage with right now

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,479
so first what you can do is add your

205
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
name into the onboarding checklist table

206
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,319
below and fill up the relevant

207
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,520
checklists

208
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,880
so this is referencing another

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
table which is the list of students so

210
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
these are just the people who have

211
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
rsvp'd and then

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
people have selected and we can add new

213
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
rows people have selected from this drop

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,759
down or by typing their name

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
they can select

216
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,639
and then can add check boxes

217
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,919
when they have completed different

218
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,919
stages of this onboarding so here's just

219
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,759
a few things that people can do

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,400
you can have the physical textbook which

221
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
is pretty cool also it's the free

222
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
download like we discussed on this top

223
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
page

224
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
you may want to plan the time in your

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
own calendar for when and how you're

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
going to work

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,919
even if you don't know what the details

228
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,039
are we're going to talk a lot about

229
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
practices but you might just want to say

230
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,599
okay doing two hours in this block on

231
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
this day or i'm going to try to come to

232
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
this weekly session time

233
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
people are also welcome to add links to

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,199
their own personal or active blog

235
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,839
platform this is an affordance that not

236
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
everyone is required to engage in

237
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,760
nothing is mandated it's totally just a

238
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,599
service and an experience that we're

239
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
co-creating in this first cohort but you

240
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
may want to

241
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
have some short or medium or long

242
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
writings

243
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,839
about your reflections and about your

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,839
learnings so you may want to add this

245
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,839
blog and it's cool some have already

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,959
done that

247
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,839
and then

248
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,040
we offer

249
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
this student workspace and the student

250
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
workspace you can click on that link and

251
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
you head over to here

252
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,480
and there's a link that allows you to

253
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,040
open a new coda template

254
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
and use this template and so that copies

255
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
this to your code account so

256
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,320
the template was created by activelab

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
however

258
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
it is not going to be like viewable or

259
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
anything so this is not

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
something part of the textbook group

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,880
shared cohort um coda this is just going

262
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,399
to provide some tables and some

263
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
templates for you to play around but

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
also be potentially

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,760
tracking your progress in various ways

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
next we're going to go to the student

267
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
practices but

268
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,680
would alex or yvonne or anyone like to

269
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,000
just mention anything about onboarding

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
or the student workspaces

271
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,519
yeah i can give quick review on it

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
just

273
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,160
could you could you

274
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,760
open

275
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,319
the list

276
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,720
here

277
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
uh what practice is

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
uh

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
this one this one

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,079
student practice is okay it's okay also

281
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,959
yeah

282
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,880
here is the table that

283
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
help you to

284
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
track your

285
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
trick your study

286
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,640
so

287
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,959
we understand that the textbook is

288
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
not

289
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,640
not easy to read and not easy to

290
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
find time to

291
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160
have a study on it

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
so this practices

293
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,839
will help you to keep your attention

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,720
during the whole

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,839
free

296
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,880
months

297
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,320
when we will

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
study it

299
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,640
so

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
we have

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
a

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,079
small description on each

303
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
on each

304
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,760
practice and

305
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
you can even understand

306
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,439
what they are

307
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,680
by its

308
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
name

309
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
[Music]

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,399
go through it and if you will have some

311
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
questions

312
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,959
just let us know

313
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
thanks um

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
that takes us perfectly to this student

315
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
practices which is kind of the question

316
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,959
of okay we set the groundwork

317
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,600
we onboarded ourselves onto

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
the textbook group using these

319
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,959
checkboxes

320
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
and now we're ready to like participate

321
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
and to engage with the content which is

322
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,240
going to be almost entirely asynchronous

323
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
we will have some live sessions like at

324
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,560
this time or potentially at other times

325
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,959
that others scaffold however it's going

326
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
to be about the learners engagement on

327
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
their own terms and times with the

328
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,440
content and so that is where

329
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
drawing on some practices from other

330
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,839
areas

331
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,160
we have constructed this table of

332
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
student practices

333
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
so it's kind of like a grab bag or a

334
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
tool kit where people can

335
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
find some affordance for their

336
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,120
participation so if you ever find

337
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
yourself

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
uncertain on how to participate in the

339
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,000
textbook group or uncertain on how to

340
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
increase your familiarity or your

341
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
competency in active inference

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
these are practices

343
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
that you can reach for

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
and you can add comments and also we can

345
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
absolutely add

346
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,320
to the practices we can add rows we can

347
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
add descriptions and products

348
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,160
but these are some regimes of attention

349
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
some tasks you can engage in

350
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
which

351
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,200
will help you

352
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
become more familiar with the material

353
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
and so there is this practice of like

354
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,360
thinking by speaking in dialogue joining

355
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
the synchronous meetings or arranging

356
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
meetings of your own type

357
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
and then a lot of the other learning

358
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
practices are going to be

359
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
asynchronous

360
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
alex or anyone else would you like to

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
ask anything okay and yes i just fixed

362
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
the permissioning on the template so now

363
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
it should be possible for people to copy

364
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
the template over

365
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,959
and then just one other random coda tip

366
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,839
if you do control and scroll

367
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,399
or control and plus minus

368
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,639
that can make the text bigger or smaller

369
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
so that can be quite helpful sometimes

370
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,440
okay so alex or anyone else um

371
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,279
any thoughts on practices

372
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,279
uh yeah let me add something on these

373
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,920
practices um

374
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,279
we are organizing this textbook group

375
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,760
trying to provide

376
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,639
some kind of

377
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,639
new affordances

378
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,880
to learning path

379
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
which will be more effective

380
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
if you're not just reading

381
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
the textbook by your own

382
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,480
but also communicate

383
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,959
inside this

384
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,240
shared epistemic niche from one hand

385
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,560
and from another hand

386
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
based on

387
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,399
our work on in education

388
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,040
on some of our projects we understand

389
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
that if you systematically applied some

390
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,440
learning practices

391
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
and tracking your progress

392
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
possibly day by day or week by week

393
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,079
with tools that also provided

394
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,959
in the template uh

395
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,600
you just from the beginning it's good

396
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,040
looks like some but some easy

397
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
stuff

398
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,519
but basically

399
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,240
after applying these practices for a few

400
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,279
weeks

401
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,160
you can figure out how it's really could

402
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
be helpful for you

403
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
we understand that

404
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
here different people with different

405
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,680
background different expertise

406
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,560
but for study groups let's just be

407
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,399
students again

408
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,199
and just apply these practices and it

409
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,710
will bring us

410
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,120
[Music]

411
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,920
more results that we even can expect it

412
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,959
for now

413
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,399
thanks

414
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,120
thank you alex

415
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
so um

416
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,639
we're gonna explore a little bit deeper

417
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,120
into the practices and then we'll talk

418
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
more about this

419
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,680
core

420
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,040
shared epistemic aspect of our coda

421
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,399
because of course if people wanted to

422
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,600
work alone

423
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
and not have any synchronous exchanges

424
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
with people and not have any shared

425
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
epistemic niche

426
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
they could do that on their own but

427
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
we're doing something with the textbook

428
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
group in the acting lab that's

429
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,839
collaborative and participatory

430
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,680
so as

431
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
seen in the

432
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
template but also on this page mastering

433
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,839
students

434
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,279
practices the practices are there to

435
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,079
help

436
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,639
keep our attention as learners

437
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,759
on

438
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,040
the material

439
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,839
through focusing on the practices

440
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,720
and so people can add their own columns

441
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,120
and explore but these are the kinds of

442
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
things where if somebody

443
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
could have high systematicity in

444
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
developing them

445
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
like approaching them in a very

446
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
systematic and comprehensive way

447
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,600
they would be learning and applying

448
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,079
active inference as works for them so

449
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
that's kind of a cool

450
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,279
way to have a self-paced and flexible

451
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,040
educational experience

452
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
and these are also just the pages that

453
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,240
are in that student workspace so it'll

454
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,959
be cool to see how these practices

455
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,000
develop

456
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
and

457
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,599
any comments or questions that people

458
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,079
have on them

459
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
does anyone want to raise their hand or

460
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
ask a question in the chat

461
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,439
the template is not working for people

462
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,839
right now

463
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,960
so

464
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,480
um

465
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,559
so i think are there two templates

466
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,160
there's like the checklist template and

467
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
then there's the student workspace

468
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,520
template i'm not getting the student

469
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,320
workspace one to work

470
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
as i see it doesn't work

471
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
when you

472
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
have a preview but

473
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
once you

474
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
push the button use template

475
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,799
it

476
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,400
became available for you

477
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,200
as anyone

478
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,799
where's the use template button

479
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,760
so

480
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
um what one thing also is people could

481
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,799
just

482
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,280
create a new code a document and then

483
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
just

484
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,559
copy

485
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
just ctrl c and copy it into a new

486
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,400
page so that will always work and the

487
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
template is not

488
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,799
vast

489
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,039
it's just these several tables so we'll

490
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
try to figure out the permissions

491
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,820
um

492
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,980
[Music]

493
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,160
okay

494
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,039
all right and also so i'm going to

495
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
unfold

496
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
some of these areas that we've spoken

497
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,520
about

498
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,840
and continue on with some of the

499
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
core epistemic components

500
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
of our coda and again anyone can raise

501
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,600
their hand

502
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,520
or can

503
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
add a comment in the chat yes rohan if

504
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,559
you would like to

505
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,280
ask your question

506
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,160
uh yeah so i'm not able to make copies

507
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
of this

508
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
template i'm so produce uh short once

509
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
again if you don't live

510
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
um okay so

511
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
um are you able to do to click these

512
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
three dots

513
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,039
and then do

514
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,880
copy to doc

515
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
and then copy it to a new doc

516
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,760
sorry that doesn't show up for me i'm

517
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
not okay

518
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,640
okay so then the it may just be because

519
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,440
like

520
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,799
i'm in the account that created it so

521
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,400
anyone can create a new coda document

522
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
like by clicking this back arrow

523
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
and then just creating a new document

524
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
and not kind of on that type of home

525
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,200
page

526
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
and then just

527
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,559
copy like you can just

528
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,600
go into this page and select the

529
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
content and copy it

530
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
and then just paste it into your coda

531
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,520
um

532
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
and we'll try to figure out the template

533
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
blue

534
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,919
so it did work for me if you on the

535
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,280
student workspace like the um red wheel

536
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,080
one

537
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
okay so not the orange one but the red

538
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
wheel if you click on the three dots

539
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
that are next to the workspace in the

540
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,840
sidebar there you go and click that and

541
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
then copy to doc that worked for me

542
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,400
it still may well it depends on what

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,120
somebody's access may be with um active

544
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,559
documents but

545
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,559
um copying will always work real hon did

546
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,159
that resolve it

547
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,000
uh okay so

548
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,039
i did that i could find the copy to dock

549
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,240
uh it made something not entirely sure

550
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
where it is now so so copy the dock and

551
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,480
then like we'll copy it to a new dock

552
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,039
and then oh okay and then now that's

553
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,880
totally your document so it's not part

554
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,400
of the action fork space at all

555
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
okay so i have to go back and then

556
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
search for it

557
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
yes it becomes so within the shared

558
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
epistemic niche within our shared coda

559
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
it's all like subpages in one url but

560
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
then once you copy it to your own doc

561
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,360
from a template or however it's going to

562
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,240
be your own url with your own sharing

563
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,320
privileges it's totally owned by you

564
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
okay yeah well i found it anyway yeah so

565
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
the copyright yeah great

566
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,200
okay so

567
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,880
can raise their hand if they want or ask

568
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,039
a question otherwise we'll continue on

569
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,600
to talk about um the ways in which we're

570
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
going to structure this collaborative

571
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
discourse on the material

572
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
so this discourse section has a few sub

573
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
headings

574
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,280
we have a page for ideas of the book

575
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
and so also if anything is ever like

576
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
unable to be edited

577
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
then just like but you feel like it

578
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,039
should be then just let us know because

579
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
we tried to permission things

580
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
to minimize the ability of someone to

581
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
accidentally like delete informative

582
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,480
text

583
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
and as much as possible we'll structure

584
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
things in tables

585
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,720
which should be editable so in the ideas

586
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
of the book these are like memes and

587
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
themes

588
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
what is active inference like when we

589
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
want to convey that to ourself and to

590
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
others those are the ideas

591
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
in chapter one this is an idea

592
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
and then there can be discourse on that

593
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,559
and these

594
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,480
buttons open up a canvas and you can

595
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,200
write things in there

596
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
we have um

597
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
questions this is a really important and

598
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
uh gonna be hopefully a very fascinating

599
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
and productive page

600
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,960
one coda affordance that's very

601
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,080
fun is at

602
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
is like calling a variable and that

603
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
could be anything from a person to the

604
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,760
name of a page a table or even a row in

605
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
a table

606
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
and so

607
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
the questions

608
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
can be

609
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,799
written in plain text but then also

610
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,720
people may enrich them

611
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,200
in this way and so we're going to return

612
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,039
to this question but first i just want

613
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,440
to show what equation 2.1

614
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
is

615
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
where is it coming from

616
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,559
so here in the equations section we have

617
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,559
another table with all the equations

618
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,720
right now just equation 2.1 has been

619
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
added

620
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
what is the name of the equation

621
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,320
what is the picture of the equation

622
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,520
screenshot

623
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
what page what chapter and what are some

624
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,240
tags which we'll talk about soon too

625
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
but

626
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
this is something that one person has to

627
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,760
add one time

628
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,640
then go back to questions

629
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,360
when

630
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
something is blue with an at you can

631
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,279
mouse over it or you can click on it

632
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,880
so then

633
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,600
how is equation 2 1 related to markup

634
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,799
blanket

635
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,919
is something that's very accessible

636
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,760
it's interactive we can have it

637
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,480
translated into multiple languages like

638
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
the terms we've already translated as a

639
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
lab into seven languages and especially

640
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
if people have a language that they'd

641
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,120
like to improve or add this can just be

642
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,320
added and so these kinds of

643
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,559
questions that we all raise up so

644
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,760
whether or not you do this like

645
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
ultracoda version or you just want to

646
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
write it in plain text and have somebody

647
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,279
else improve it

648
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,400
this is going to be able to create

649
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
computationally accessible

650
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
representations of questions that are

651
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,760
very clear

652
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,400
and also answers that are very clear and

653
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,159
there can be multiple answers in a lot

654
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,440
of discourse

655
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
but then those are addressing what

656
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,520
are

657
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
some answers to that question that like

658
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,799
a person may have

659
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,840
and

660
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
again uh

661
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
it's awesome if a question instead of

662
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,760
like

663
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,799
coming from an ill-specified

664
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,640
pointer and a

665
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
unclear regime of attention of course we

666
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
have uncertainty that's what the

667
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
question is representing but also we can

668
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
ask it in a way where even if we totally

669
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,760
don't know

670
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,840
what i don't know what equation 2.1 is

671
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
showing

672
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
i don't know what the markov blanket is

673
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
but by asking it in this way there's

674
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
like a conversation to have and people

675
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
can upvote interesting questions

676
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
and then again

677
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
we'll add the figures

678
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,440
as rows in the figures

679
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
the equations

680
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
here so then someone can say how does

681
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,080
figure 1.1 relate to action what was

682
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,440
figure 1.1 ah okay how does figure 1.1

683
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,720
relate to

684
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
ok action

685
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
those are just some of the ways in which

686
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,360
we'll be able to

687
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
have this

688
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
really

689
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,039
special

690
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
interactive space so that was that

691
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,679
questions page where we'll just be

692
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,159
building tons and tons of questions

693
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,600
and whether you write them initially in

694
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,279
your own private workspace or you want

695
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,760
to write them here

696
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,279
another important aspect of the

697
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,400
questions

698
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,279
is that the textbook doesn't have any

699
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,200
exercises or questions of any kind

700
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,919
and so this is like

701
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
in this first cohort and in this

702
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,279
textbook group

703
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,880
in general we're

704
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
in a sense creating some questions and

705
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
clarifying

706
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,200
adventures around

707
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,279
this textbook itself

708
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,360
as learners so that's the questions page

709
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
in the live meetings

710
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
page

711
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,679
we write that all are encouraged to join

712
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
these live meetings

713
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
or watch their video recordings where

714
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
we're going to be going over the ideas

715
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,960
of the book and the questions

716
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,760
the timings are noted here

717
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,880
of this

718
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
weekly time slot and what the theme or

719
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
the regime of attention is going to be

720
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,000
and also you've been added to a calendar

721
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,679
using the email you signed up for or you

722
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
can add these links in

723
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,520
and then if

724
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,880
somebody wants to

725
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,679
propose a one-off time or a recurrent

726
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,880
time

727
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
where they want to co-work

728
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
or they want to do these sessions they

729
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,440
absolutely can do that and we can update

730
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
the textbook group calendar here

731
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,760
the video recordings will be posted

732
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,600
to these links afterwards

733
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,760
and in this first meeting we're having

734
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,760
the onboarding session now

735
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,919
this is going to set

736
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,200
a

737
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
pace for moving through the first five

738
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,480
chapters of this textbook over the next

739
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,000
three months

740
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and there's plenty

741
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,240
to dig into and plenty of rabbit holes

742
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,360
to explore

743
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
and so some might go

744
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,559
read ahead or

745
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
be behind you know life happens and

746
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
we're accommodating of that but this is

747
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
gonna set

748
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
a rhythm and a pace

749
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
where we'll be able to go okay we're

750
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
gonna talk about chapter one so what are

751
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
we going to do we're going to go to the

752
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,440
ideas of the book and the questions

753
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,679
we're going to look at what are some

754
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
ideas in chapter one

755
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,919
what are some questions that are tagged

756
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,120
with

757
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,480
specific references in chapter one and

758
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,080
what has been upvoted if there's too

759
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,799
many to discuss and then that is gonna

760
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,279
be the structuring of the regime of

761
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,000
attention so it would be super helpful

762
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
if somebody especially wants to like be

763
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
speaking and asking questions about it

764
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
the material to put in the time before

765
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,320
to add those so that people can

766
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,480
parse it and really consider your

767
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,200
question and your ideas

768
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
beforehand

769
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,399
because

770
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,120
there's differences in our language and

771
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,159
our familiarity with active inference so

772
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,640
sometimes the spontaneous

773
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
rant

774
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
is difficult for

775
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,120
others to parse and

776
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,600
structuring our questions

777
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
and writing the ideas down and helping

778
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
improve how each other's have shared it

779
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,240
will be a really important shared

780
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,200
practice

781
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
and then we can have people in the live

782
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
meetings taking notes on the questions

783
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,279
and so then if somebody does have a

784
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,279
spontaneous thought arising in

785
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,960
relationship to a question

786
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,679
or some discourse on an idea

787
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,840
we can absolutely record it and

788
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,520
and make that something that persists

789
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,480
rather than just uh a sort of

790
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,799
offhand comment in a video chat

791
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,559
so those are the live meetings and the

792
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,399
calendar

793
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,279
and we're in gather right now and so

794
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,480
there's some

795
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
information on if you'd like to for

796
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
example enable

797
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,320
various features of gather

798
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,559
including adding live text captioning to

799
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,919
your video if that's like something

800
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,480
you're interested in

801
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,600
but this is just a little bit of a

802
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
technical note on how to use gather and

803
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,200
some of the affordances of gather

804
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,640
okay

805
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,279
i cannot find the raise your hand button

806
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,080
i have not used it on an ipad

807
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,600
um but

808
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,919
on the bottom there's a hand

809
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,159
that raises your hand and also it stays

810
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,799
raised unless you unraise it and then

811
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,440
it's also there in the emoji

812
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,159
and all the emojis are transient

813
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,120
except for when you hit um the hand or

814
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
when you hit just six

815
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,279
from your computer then that raises your

816
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,320
hand

817
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,120
but um ali if you want to ask a question

818
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,840
then please feel free but first um okay

819
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,039

okay

825
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,880
so

826
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,600
we have project ideas

827
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
so here was a suggestion by a

828
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,440
participant

829
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,320
so

830
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,679
as with

831
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,760
many suggestions

832
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,679
this is our editable space we're the

833
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,679
first cohort of the textbook group so

834
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,559
however we want to do this

835
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,720
we can do it

836
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,279
feel free to list any project ideas here

837
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
so this is a fully editable page people

838
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,640
can just add

839
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,399
wouldn't it be cool like if there was an

840
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,799
audiobook recording i don't know

841
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,480
maybe that's something that somebody

842
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,159
else will see as a very exciting

843
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,480
opportunity so you can add different

844
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,440
project ideas and then

845
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
we've provided a template for some

846
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,320
tables that you can copy out

847
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,480
that are kind of like questions that

848
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
will help provide some overview

849
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
information

850
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
on your project optional of course just

851
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
like everything or add columns add rows

852
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,080
delete it's all up to you

853
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880
and

854
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,679
questions that are about the situation

855
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,919
that you're seeing that is motivating

856
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,159
that kind of a project idea

857
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,440
and help you get some initial

858
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
structuring around like how you would go

859
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,039
about doing that

860
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,200
and this will get your idea from the

861
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,320
sort of

862
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,559
format here into something maybe that

863
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,519
other people could get on board with

864
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,440
so that's in the discourse um because

865
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,200
these are like really

866
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,399
content

867
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,640
and perspectives that

868
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,960
as a textbook group we're going to be

869
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,880
adding and creating

870
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,840
in this textbook section

871
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,519
it's going to be really focused on the

872
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,640
textbook as that core artifact so as

873
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,240
mentioned before there's the special

874
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
pages and tables

875
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,279
with the figures equations and the boxes

876
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,120
so then oh yes

877
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,000
at

878
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,039
b o x space 2.1

879
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,559
enter

880
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,200
at box 2.1 oh okay

881
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
there it is

882
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
and then people can have any questions

883
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,320
or comments and so on and then that

884
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
could be referenced in a question

885
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,960
somewhere else

886
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,320
what does at box space 2.1

887
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,519
mean for

888
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,559
um there's also these chapters and so

889
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,080
the chapters

890
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,039
are

891
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,440
listed here and linked so you can click

892
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,240
on five and go to chapter five

893
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,000
there's also a detailed table of

894
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,840
contents which

895
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,640
may have been created by dave or he

896
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
found it but he sent it to us and this

897
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
is like a really

898
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,519
fine-grained

899
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,880
look at the sections of the book

900
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,440
and whichever column in a table

901
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
as this ribbon

902
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,600
is the one that's called the display

903
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
column

904
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,559
so you can have like a set as display

905
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,440
column

906
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,519
and so that means like

907
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,200
um i was reading at 1.4.2

908
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,760
and this happens

909
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,159
it's page 11.

910
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
so every row

911
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,799
and all of its associated columns

912
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,360
can be referenced anywhere within this

913
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,679
coda you won't be able to reference

914
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,159
these rows in another coda

915
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
but this is like our shared commons of

916
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,960
information where we're able to enrich

917
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,359
the rows and create rows for each other

918
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
and that will hopefully create kind of

919
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,119
like a snowball effect with our digital

920
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,399
stigma g

921
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,399
because people will be able to ask

922
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,599
amazing

923
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,320
well supported questions

924
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,800
and then those questions themself

925
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
when

926
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,918
blue

927
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,000
asked

928
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,599
how is equation 2.1 related to this

929
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,119
here's what it made me think of so

930
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,960
there's like a structuring

931
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,280
to the way in which we can use certain

932
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,359
pieces of information and so again we

933
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,040
have the textbook section with the

934
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,320
chapters

935
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
and like we're starting on chapter one

936
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
and these are a lot of concepts and area

937
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
where people can explore

938
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,359
now you'll see that a lot of terms

939
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,520
have this at and they're blue so let's

940
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
look at where that is coming from and

941
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,240
that takes us to the last section of our

942
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,160
coda and then we'll spend the last 15

943
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,920
minutes with just

944
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,079
discussion and questions

945
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,520
the um

946
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
somebody has asked does coda allow text

947
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
to be formatted with latex thank you

948
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
brock for sharing the link

949
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,480
and um

950
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,200
yes if people would like that that's

951
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
something we can absolutely do

952
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
additionally we could um have a column

953
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
here

954
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
insert column after

955
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,839
and this can just be the latex

956
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,560
representation for example

957
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
so then you can copy and paste that to

958
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
allow people to modify it or to use it

959
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,800
in another work

960
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
okay so where are these core terms

961
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
coming from

962
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
in active inference tables we have a few

963
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,240
different tables

964
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,440
that are

965
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
prepared and created also in a

966
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,880
collaborative way

967
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,240
in other projects of the actin flap

968
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,560
so those who are participating in the

969
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,920
lab may know about some of these

970
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,760
projects but for those of you who might

971
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,119
be joining the first active lab

972
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,599
activity right now here's what these are

973
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,560
about

974
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
so active inference ontology

975
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,280
you can go to this link

976
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,599
and see the public version of the actin

977
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,280
phontology so this is like a link you

978
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,640
can share with anyone

979
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,800
and it has two pages there's the

980
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,119
definitions

981
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,160
of

982
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,079
core terms

983
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,920
which we'll return to and then there's

984
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,720
the translations

985
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,839
so here we have

986
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,079
i'll edit and resolve this but for core

987
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,040
terms

988
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,160
we have spanish portuguese french

989
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,280
italian czech russian and hebrew

990
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,520
so if there's a language that somebody

991
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,920
has some familiarity with even if you

992
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
only know some of it

993
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,200
it would be super helpful

994
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,640
to start to work in the dot edu

995
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,880
organizational unit of active lab on

996
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
this ontology project because we're

997
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,320
really

998
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,400
focused on making this accessible to

999
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
those with different mathematical

1000
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,480
backgrounds and also different

1001
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,960
speaking of different languages so it's

1002
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,520
an awesome way even if you don't know

1003
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
that much active inference to translate

1004
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,880
some terms

1005
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,280
and potentially bridge into a totally

1006
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,599
new area

1007
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,280
those tables

1008
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
are in

1009
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,359
our coda here so there's like another

1010
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,240
coda that's holding the actual

1011
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,960
um ontology and then this is a cross

1012
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,839
document poll which we can like sync and

1013
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,440
so that's one of the really important

1014
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,079
and powerful features of coda so

1015
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,839
each of these terms

1016
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,720
can be called using an at so at

1017
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
action space

1018
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,760
planning

1019
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,920
and then clicking that

1020
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,640
enables the definition to pop up and

1021
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,079
there's a ton of other columns but we

1022
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,560
just wanted to pull a simple version

1023
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
so the ontology

1024
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
page

1025
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,079
is hosting the table

1026
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,720
that is giving the definitions of

1027
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,919
different ontology terms

1028
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,440
and also there's the public site

1029
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,520
the live stream

1030
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
table

1031
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,280
has many many papers

1032
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
some may be familiar or not that we've

1033
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,839
done

1034
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,480
150 plus live streams

1035
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,440
the

1036
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,000
live streams in the round table section

1037
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
have to do with active lab updates and

1038
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
strategy

1039
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
in the live stream section

1040
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,320
these are

1041
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,839
on papers and so you'll find 46 papers

1042
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,720
that we've been discussing over the last

1043
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,480
however many months

1044
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
and these are like great if you want to

1045
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,160
dive into any of the papers that are

1046
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
listed here

1047
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,240
the guests stream

1048
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,440
are

1049
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,720
visiting

1050
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,119
presentations and discussions

1051
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:11,920
that

1052
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,520
different individuals in the sort of

1053
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,839
active or adjacent areas are presenting

1054
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,599
on so if anybody has like a

1055
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,000
recommendation or a connection or would

1056
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,079
like to present on a guest stream these

1057
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,560
are scheduled on a more ad hoc basis but

1058
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
they have tons of awesome

1059
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,599
uh

1060
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,839
areas and applications

1061
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,040
model stream is more specifically about

1062
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,480
modeling

1063
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,200
and um one of particular note is this

1064
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,359
four part series with christopher white

1065
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,440
and ryan smith on the step-by-step

1066
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,359
active inference guide which is like a

1067
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,079
paper that is very very similar to the

1068
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,320
textbook it's not exactly the same of

1069
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,720
course but it also walks through a lot

1070
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,079
of the things that the textbook walks

1071
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,040
through

1072
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
um then an org stream is about

1073
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,599
organization and so we have also some

1074
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,359
other formats that haven't been used too

1075
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,040
much and we have this um

1076
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,839
symposium that we did with carl fristen

1077
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,560
last year so this live streams table is

1078
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
just if you feel like listening or

1079
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,280
watching some live streams on any number

1080
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
of a ton of different topics related to

1081
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
active inference that we've done as a

1082
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,560
lab and these are ones that you can

1083
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
participate in like if you want to talk

1084
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,200
about some of these papers you can join

1085
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,880
a live stream

1086
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,720
then there's this active inference

1087
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,319
research

1088
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,960
tab which is just sort of a partial view

1089
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,280
but it's been work with blue and our

1090
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,800
colleague rj

1091
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
where we're working to be able to

1092
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
reference papers

1093
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,000
in a very rich and interactive way

1094
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,240
inside and outside of coda so you'll

1095
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,440
find the abstracts and some information

1096
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,599
on several hundred active inference

1097
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,960
papers

1098
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,560
in case you're looking for it

1099
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,640
but there's also a lot more to this so

1100
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,920
if you're interested in knowledge

1101
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,400
engineering and in curating active

1102
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,319
inference research and annotating

1103
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,040
research and these types of tasks then

1104
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,880
this is like a awesome area

1105
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,599
that takes us through the sections of

1106
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,720
the coda

1107
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,680
so just to recap info contains some

1108
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,160
information on pre-onboarding with the

1109
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,440
rules and directory and then the

1110
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
onboarding itself which everybody is

1111
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,839
welcomed to carry out for themselves

1112
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,400
student workspace provides some

1113
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,480
templates and ideas which you can

1114
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,520
elaborate on and so on but some ways

1115
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,000
that you can stay on top of

1116
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,160
carrying out the student practices and

1117
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,480
so anytime you're uncertain about what

1118
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,720
actions to engage in to reduce your

1119
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
uncertainty about learning and applying

1120
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,960
active inference these are always things

1121
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,800
that you can do

1122
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,680
in the discourse that's going to host

1123
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,640
some of the material and the discussions

1124
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,480
that we're having synchronously and

1125
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,880
asynchronously around the book

1126
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
about the ideas in the book and the

1127
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,240
questions that are raising up

1128
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,119
and also hosting some project ideas that

1129
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
people are rising up or seeing as

1130
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,720
potentially relevant

1131
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,640
then the textbook itself

1132
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,220
is going to host um

1133
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,680
[Music]

1134
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,280
unpacking and connections of the content

1135
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,760
in the chapters and also with a special

1136
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,319
focus on this annotation of the figures

1137
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
equations boxes and so on

1138
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,119
that will allow the rest of the coda to

1139
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,520
be like referencing the book

1140
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,760
very clearly

1141
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,960
and then there's the active inference

1142
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,200
tables which are just showing off a few

1143
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,599
of the coda features and a few of the

1144
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,119
other projects in active lab and

1145
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,000
so

1146
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,119
that will be

1147
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,599
at least the initial conditions of

1148
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,839
our

1149
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,880
coda and it'll probably evolve a lot in

1150
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,960
the coming three months

1151
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,920
so

1152
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,040
that concludes the more presentation

1153
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,079
aspects

1154
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,400
of this onboarding session

1155
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,040
for the next 15 minutes

1156
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,079
anyone can type a question into the chat

1157
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,800
or can raise their hands and we'll

1158
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,440
hear from them

1159
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,960
and then what's coming up next

1160
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,480
is

1161
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,520
over the next week we'll be

1162
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,839
reading chapter one

1163
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,680
engaging with the practices as they

1164
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,640
relate

1165
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,359
to

1166
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,079
chapter one planning to read chapter one

1167
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,359
investing time in reading chapter one

1168
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,359
writing notes

1169
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
adding a little blog post

1170
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,040
asking questions about chapter one

1171
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,319
talking to your

1172
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,480
friends or family or active colleagues

1173
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,720
about chapter one working with the

1174
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,839
formalisms in chapter one

1175
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,599
if people would like to there's a

1176
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,760
totally optional link here

1177
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,160
that they can use a hypothesis

1178
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,119
annotation of the pdf so just it's there

1179
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,880
if people want to but as with all these

1180
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,240
practices they're totally optional and

1181
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,800
this is like an off-site thing

1182
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,040
um

1183
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,400
and then

1184
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,319
we'll continue on

1185
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,839
so

1186
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,280
that is um

1187
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,599
yes okay roland asks

1188
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,359
thanks for coordinating this are the

1189
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,920
authors going to be participating at all

1190
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,400
so we're in contact with the authors and

1191
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,280
i won't speak for them into their

1192
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,800
degree of participation in the future

1193
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,960
which is unknown but they're excited and

1194
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
hopefully happy

1195
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,839
that

1196
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,400
we're engaging in this way and we are in

1197
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,760
contact with them but if there's some

1198
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,040
other piece of information we can

1199
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,079
provide sure

1200
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,000
also they'll be watching the recorded

1201
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,319
videos at least one of the authors

1202
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,760
so yes

1203
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,400
yes some of them may view some recorded

1204
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,599
videos and they have access to the coda

1205
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,760
and it would be awesome

1206
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,520
for example

1207
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,359
to have questions that we don't know the

1208
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,400
answer to

1209
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,839
maybe they do know the answer but also

1210
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,599
maybe they don't and maybe there's

1211
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,040
somebody here who does or there's

1212
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,480
another author

1213
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,079
who we can contact

1214
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,480
um the textbook is a

1215
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,720
a summary and a distillation and a tip

1216
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
of the iceberg of a lot of ongoing

1217
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,000
research

1218
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,839
and so

1219
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,160
asking those questions and then also in

1220
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
the active lab we have

1221
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,040
um relationships and ways of engaging

1222
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,760
with many authors and relevant people

1223
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,880
hopefully

1224
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,920
so

1225
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,079
we could

1226
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,920
make it happen if it's important to make

1227
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,000
it happen

1228
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,919
ron or anyone else with a question

1229
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,680
in the chat or

1230
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,280
with their hand what is something that

1231
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,800
people are just

1232
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,720
excited or

1233
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,800
motivated motivated about

1234
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,319
what do they do

1235
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,040
daniel did you not hear rohan no i it

1236
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,440
says connecting for me sorry about that

1237
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,920
oh yeah so rohan just asked a question

1238
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,800
um maybe i think um he might need to

1239
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,160
reload but

1240
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,560
his question was will there be any code

1241
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,880
involved at all what is the preferred

1242
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
like platform for writing code or is it

1243
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,880
just math

1244
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,760
thanks

1245
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,720
so

1246
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
appendix c uh yeah i'm sorry about that

1247
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,240
sometimes this does happen like as the

1248
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,480
recording will show um you're just

1249
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
connecting and so in those cases where

1250
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,160
it seems like two people in gather like

1251
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,240
are having a misconnection like one or

1252
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,079
both people can reload and it usually

1253
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,880
fixes it so sorry about that um

1254
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,760
in the code section there's going to be

1255
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,839
a few ways to engage with the code

1256
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,160
one thing is that appendix c

1257
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,839
is an annotated matlab

1258
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,280
um code

1259
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,040
so especially um in the older work

1260
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,400
related to

1261
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,520
spm statistical parametric mapping and

1262
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,040
some of the earlier active inference

1263
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,359
work matlab was the primary language

1264
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,119
that was utilized

1265
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
more recently there's been developments

1266
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,640
in python and in julia

1267
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,960
yes absolutely so pi mdp does offer code

1268
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
so that's in python

1269
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,359
and then another area of code that some

1270
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,680
may be interested in developing in is

1271
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,880
active block forms which is also

1272
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
in python and was

1273
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,800
initiated by jacob

1274
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
and active block friends is implementing

1275
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,359
active inference entities and

1276
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,680
environments in cad cad which is a

1277
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,880
complex systems design suite so that's

1278
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,520
in python there's also julia

1279
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,680
and some active inference methods in

1280
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,200
julia

1281
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,160
that are created by the bias lab

1282
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,280
and

1283
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,079
we also have created this repository

1284
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,680
in github

1285
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,599
for the textbook itself

1286
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,920
so if anybody comments on this and just

1287
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,079
says add me here's my github username

1288
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,400
right here we'll add them to that

1289
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
repository so if people want to do their

1290
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,680
own code adventure of course great make

1291
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,880
it happen um if people want to work in a

1292
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,559
shop in a shared

1293
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,880
code repository space

1294
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,599
we'll have this

1295
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,160
if people want to do any adventures in

1296
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,359
python and julia and pi mdp and active

1297
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,200
block brands and forney lab and all

1298
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,359
these other amazing affordances they're

1299
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,599
absolutely welcome to

1300
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,160
we'll just remember that we're learning

1301
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,559
the content of the textbook in the

1302
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,880
textbook group and those are amazing

1303
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,720
research and application avenues that

1304
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
are super important and it's exactly

1305
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,119
what learning active inference gets us

1306
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,040
to the position of being able to engage

1307
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,839
with

1308
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:52,640
um

1309
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,240
and i think

1310
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,599
there's

1311
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,040
as we'll maybe uncover um reasons why

1312
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,680
the book is written primarily in natural

1313
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,480
language

1314
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,520
and figures and equations

1315
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,200
it could have been a

1316
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,440
notebook but it wasn't

1317
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,079
so yes hopefully for those who are

1318
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,160
computationally inclined

1319
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,520
we'll have some code available

1320
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,559
and also um again people can

1321
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,960
raise their hand or ask a question but

1322
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,839
um this is what the ontology

1323
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,160
as we develop it and it's already far

1324
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,839
more developed than this but if people

1325
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,599
want to get involved here

1326
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,280
one of the aims

1327
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,760
is to have integrity across different

1328
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,200
representations

1329
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,240
of different human natural languages

1330
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,640
different computational languages and

1331
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,800
the formalisms in the analytical nature

1332
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,960
of some of the core

1333
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,559
of active inference

1334
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,400
and so we can in the equations have tags

1335
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,359
so

1336
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,319
that will help us use ontology tags

1337
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,800
to connect equations to

1338
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,079
scripts

1339
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,839
that are out there

1340
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,079
using those same terms and so there can

1341
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,319
be like a short blog article in another

1342
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,000
language you don't speak

1343
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,839
and a script in a computer language you

1344
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,599
don't understand and a figure that you

1345
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,480
didn't make but we can connect that

1346
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,800
and generate and comprehend it in a way

1347
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,640
that

1348
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,520
may not have been done in other fields

1349
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,200
or at other times so those are some of

1350
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,720
the really exciting ways that we can

1351
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,040
combine our perspective and our regimes

1352
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,400
of attention

1353
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,960
with appropriate collaboration so that

1354
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,800
we can actually

1355
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,880
learn and apply active inference better

1356
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,119
because again if people just wanted to

1357
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,400
listen to the

1358
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,559
fristen lectures on youtube and read the

1359
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,760
book alone

1360
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,160
they absolutely can but to be engaged in

1361
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,800
the textbook group is to be doing

1362
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,280
something that's collaborative so hope

1363
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,720
that addresses it

1364
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,920
and

1365
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,520
if anybody else wants to

1366
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,119
raise their hand or ask a question in

1367
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,559
the chat there's still time to do so

1368
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,240
yeah in in the chat though what what do

1369
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,119
people

1370
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,839
expect and prefer

1371
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,920
what would be epistemically valuable for

1372
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,640
you

1373
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,800
what would be pragmatically valuable for

1374
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,800
you

1375
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,119
on the top right you can switch from

1376
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,200
light to dark

1377
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,200
in the coda

1378
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,640
just in case it looks very different for

1379
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,640
you

1380
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,040
so yeah this onboarding session

1381
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,280
could have been about any topic

1382
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,280
although we were looking at active

1383
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,200
inference related themes and we're

1384
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,800
setting up of course for the textbook

1385
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,480
group we

1386
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,960
didn't discuss any of the material

1387
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,559
but that's exactly what is going to be

1388
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,000
happening

1389
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,640
in the actual weeks to come

1390
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,799
so

1391
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,119
if anyone has like any

1392
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,720
kind of

1393
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,079
notes they'd like to add in

1394
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,760
for the people who are here and for the

1395
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,119
people who may be re-watching this

1396
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,640
recording

1397
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,160
feel free to add anything again if

1398
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,799
anybody wants to

1399
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
okay

1400
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,720
so i type the slash

1401
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,839
which opens up coda affordances like

1402
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,000
inserting any number of

1403
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,040
things and then

1404
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,280
inserting a table

1405
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,200
and this will be

1406
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,280
active inference

1407
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,960
code

1408
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,880
and so then we can start

1409
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,720
go from the unstructured list to the

1410
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,160
structured list

1411
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,440
into the table

1412
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,280
what language is it

1413
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,359
is it a walk-through or is it something

1414
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,920
for application and structure

1415
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,280
that discussion around code

1416
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,920
yeah thank you everybody who's um who's

1417
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,680
joining we're

1418
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,240
enacting the kind of epistemic niche for

1419
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,480
active inference that we are

1420
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
implicitly or explicitly

1421
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,200
expecting and preferring so we might as

1422
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,200
well

1423
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,760
and and the organizing

1424
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,960
we can also note was in edu and comms so

1425
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,319
in two of our weekly active lab meetings

1426
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,960
so there's a whole team and many people

1427
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,119
contributed variously

1428
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,079
to setting up this niche

1429
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,200
and

1430
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,760
set up the niche was all we did like

1431
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,000
it's for us to actually co-create in our

1432
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,960
learning

1433
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,839
but

1434
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:50,839
this was a

1435
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,720
participatory project just like

1436
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,040
everything in actin flap is so if

1437
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,040
anybody is like wanting to learn more

1438
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,520
about participating in other active lab

1439
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,720
activities

1440
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,240
on the top page

1441
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,680
you can

1442
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,839
learn more about becoming a participant

1443
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,319
in academic lab as well so there's like

1444
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,720
a ton of cool projects to get involved

1445
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,599
in

1446
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,280
including active block for instance a

1447
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,280
lot of in the ontology educational

1448
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,640
materials

1449
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,119
future cohorts of the textbook group

1450
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,280
and so on so there'll be a ton to do

1451
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,960
all right

1452
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,359
so that concludes the onboarding session

1453
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,280
i'm going to stop the recording unless

1454
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,480
anyone has any final thoughts

1455
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,040
okay i'm gonna stop the recording
