1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,580
welcome

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,020
it's cohort one meeting 17 already and

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,200
it's September 23rd 2022 we're having

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,380
our first discussion of chapter seven in

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,480
the textbook

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,500
well

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,180
we have

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
many ways to go

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,699
we have questions on chapter seven that

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,359
people have been adding

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,099
we also have

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,779
um some

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,559
summaries and overviews and uh can walk

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
through the text directly

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
but first does anyone want to just raise

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,820
their hand or unmute and give

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,920
any thought that they had on chapter

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,100
seven their experience reading it

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,140
their understanding of where it's

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,960
situated in the textbook overall what

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,539
was in it or what was not in it

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,660
Etc

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
laughs

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,119
okay well

25
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,600
all uh open again please raise your

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
hands or write in the chat if you want

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,759
to address anything at any point

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
I want to open

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,900
um by acknowledging a lot of the

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,479
contributions ali uh made

31
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,540
and uh in some conversations that he and

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,100
I had earlier this week

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,079
that I believe

34
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,500
all of you cohort wonders will find

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,200
interesting

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
um but first let's just start with this

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
quotation we're going to start with the

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,619
opening quotation the chapter then I'm

39
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,899
going to surface some discussions with

40
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,360
Ali and then we're going to go into some

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,340
details of the chapter

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,500
so the quote is what I cannot create I

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,239
do not understand

44
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,520
by RF so

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,760
what does anyone think about that

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,520
quotation or what is it uh mean in this

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,879
context

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,680
um

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,220
I think

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,400
uh I mean it it's more applicable

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,060
applicable

52
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,599
applicable the more complex the the

53
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,120
thing is that you're trying to build but

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,540
like how could your generative what

55
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,940
priors or for what way could your

56
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,099
generative model create

57
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,760
and accurate prediction

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,840
of the operation of something or the

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,480
underlying dynamics of something if you

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,280
do not

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,840
kind of step-by-step

62
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,120
generate the afford and take the actions

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,239
that generate those affordances

64
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,659
I don't see any causal path to doing so

65
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,860
with help

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,700
like you would have to step through it

67
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,400
necessarily if it's

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,480
computationally like complex

69
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
so

70
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,400
that's most things in the world but

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,959
yeah

72
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,940
awesome it's like this is like the low

73
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,700
road answer like how can the generative

74
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,040
model have anything

75
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,140
like understanding

76
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,360
without generating you can't just have

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,620
it on the Shelf

78
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,360
and then someone

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,840
um has added the mild answer

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,799
we can't have understanding

81
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,120
just through mental envisioning

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
that the algorithms need to be

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,980
implemented for a learner's Journey

84
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,220
and then this is also um an even deeper

85
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,379
or stronger point

86
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,299
which

87
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,579
first and others have been

88
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,160
working on for a long time which is like

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,820
it's sentient artifacts in the world

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,860
that will be

91
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,400
the realization of active inference

92
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,759
it's not just like some nice derivations

93
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,400
Brock and then anyone else

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,199
I was just gonna add uh something about

95
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
hidden states there I mean it's again

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,979
coming back to computational complexity

97
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,419
but there's there's

98
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,639
things now that we're starting to build

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,660
that we don't really 100 understand all

100
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,639
of the Dynamics of what is or just in

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,860
general like we invent things that we

102
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,380
don't completely understand first and

103
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,199
then based on the observational

104
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,540
based on the evidence that we observe

105
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,660
that it is consistently exhibiting some

106
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,780
behavior that that directs our attention

107
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,520
that directs

108
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,020
where our generative model

109
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,979
pursues like

110
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,000
you know more observations but um

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,280
we're definitely getting towards a point

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,320
where that's like kind of no longer

113
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,660
going to be possible in the way that we

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,639
usually use them try to use math to just

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
shortcut stuff

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,320
where the the operation of the Dynamics

117
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,580
of the things that we're going to build

118
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,280
are necessarily going to be

119
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
they will be the proof of their

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,479
existence will be their own proof

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,699
awesome

122
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,340
okay so just fun you know starting

123
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,320
quotation upload that one for sure

124
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,639
though

125
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,400
um there's some detailed things about

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,699
[Music]

127
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,199
um

128
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,199
the examples

129
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,100
and I also uh and some of these I've

130
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,440
been working on everyone is welcome for

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,080
every chapter to be contributing on

132
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,240
these Pages like kind of just trying to

133
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,060
overview what these examples are because

134
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,919
a chapter

135
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,039
it states it up front yet I missed it

136
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,680
the first several times reading it like

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,620
these Illustrated models of

138
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,539
every color in the rainbow

139
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,060
are the section titles

140
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,400
and those are the functionalities that

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,160
are getting layered in

142
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,139
sometimes building on the same model

143
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,600
like there's like teammates version one

144
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,880
then there's team A's version two

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,560
other times it's switching between

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,139
models or showing two different models

147
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,880
that illustrate the same cognitive

148
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
functionality

149
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,780
other times the simulation outputs are

150
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,020
shown other times they're not so there's

151
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,780
like a lot of heterogeneity

152
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,780
in the observations in this chapter

153
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,080
but it really wasn't until I saw that

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,220
these

155
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,400
first paragraph words were the section

156
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,660
titles

157
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,759
that it made more sense how the chapter

158
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,160
was being like laid out

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,500
um so that's just kind of one

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,560
uh notes

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,940
um

162
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,699
Ollie do you wanna

163
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,639
raise any thoughts or describe a little

164
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,020
bit about our

165
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,240
discussion on like

166
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,740
how we're going to move forward on the

167
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,039
equations

168
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:35,940
okay

169
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,220
if you unmute then go for it otherwise

170
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,840
I'll um

171
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,780
let me see okay yes no Mike thank you

172
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,060
all good so

173
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,080
um we were discussing how there are

174
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,400
several layers

175
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,680
um as with other scriptural Traditions

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,039
there's levels of readings

177
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,800
so there's a level of reading

178
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,080
that is even

179
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,440
um more granular or below where we've

180
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,199
been currently targeting like here's

181
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,240
equation two five

182
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,280
there's a reading

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,380
for accessibility and understanding that

184
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,960
would potentially be like f open square

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,319
bracket Q comma y closed bracket equals

186
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,259
negative sign expectation over Q open

187
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,340
parenthesis X Etc so it's like the

188
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,060
reading of the notation

189
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,039
then the notation can be substituted for

190
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,559
terms in the active fontology which is

191
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,719
like the level that's being described

192
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,500
here

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,640
but this is not to be seen here

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,020
um

195
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,720
this is the level where notation could

196
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
be aligned across papers because their

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,640
notational reading would be different

198
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,680
but then they might be referring to the

199
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,380
same exact composition of the actin

200
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,420
fontology

201
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,480
then once the ontology definition has

202
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,760
been squared

203
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,800
the terms could be condensed into

204
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,140
meaningful units like accuracy

205
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,820
complexity

206
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,459
risk expected risk

207
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,140
that gives

208
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,899
um a symbolic in the more

209
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,019
conversational sense rather than in the

210
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,839
like notational sense

211
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,779
and then that's where

212
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,660
memes and themes and rhetoric around

213
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,000
like what active inference formalisms

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,959
say

215
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,480
start to arise

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,899
and then there's the consequences of

217
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,459
changes in relationships within and

218
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,380
outside the formalism

219
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,240
because it's kind of like we're all

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,420
there's this larger structure for like a

221
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,040
pomdp

222
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,380
and changing one variable if you're only

223
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,320
looking at like one view or one kind of

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,480
sub formalism

225
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,820
but you know turn it up to 11.

226
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,980
yet that might influence other variables

227
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,660
that aren't part of that formalism

228
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,860
itself

229
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,320
and so this is like a very open

230
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,300
question that touches on everything from

231
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,220
like the implications

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,899
of changes

233
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,180
to relationships that aren't formally

234
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,680
specified

235
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,540
for example the base graph the edges

236
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,339
reflect a certain type of relationship

237
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:21,899
as we've explored

238
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,860
but

239
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,019
changes from one can propagate

240
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,700
throughout a whole system potentially in

241
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,200
non-linear ways

242
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,600
so it's always going to be this kind of

243
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,560
open area

244
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,720
how changes

245
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
including like counterfactuals about the

246
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,980
formalism what if risks were situated

247
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,740
this way instead of that way or how does

248
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,420
that relate in this case like so this is

249
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,339
kind of an open one again people please

250
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,220
update it and and modify it

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,640
um but like some of these equations

252
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,300
which we'll get to so we'll come to why

253
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,940
we had that conversation in a 7.8 later

254
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,160
but that was like one um really

255
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,480
interesting

256
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
conversation

257
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,960
and then

258
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,339
[Music]

259
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,339
um

260
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
there was one other

261
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,120
okay

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,100
then just to kind of jump into a chapter

263
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,640
seven topic but also

264
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,500
kind of

265
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,839
reframe our Learning Journey

266
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,880
as we're all working through this for

267
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,079
the first time

268
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,200
um in the textbook group so

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,300
they wrote

270
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,359
um

271
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,140
this choice in the team Ace and then

272
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,820
Eric or anyone else I know that you had

273
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,320
some questions on the teammates

274
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,880
um or we can go to the earlier examples

275
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,019
but

276
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,600
this choice of what to do do you seek

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,820
out the informative cue and then go to

278
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,380
the arm that you've now reduced your

279
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,540
uncertainty about where the reward is so

280
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,519
do you take an epistemic action and then

281
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,620
have like a better chance of making the

282
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,420
pragmatically good choice

283
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,940
or do you just you know go and make the

284
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,040
pragmatic Choice do you take one step up

285
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,480
or do you take one step back for two

286
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,980
steps up

287
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,660
it speaks to the exploration

288
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,240
exploitation dilemma in Psychology and

289
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,519
machine learning a dilemma that's

290
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,700
resolved under active inference

291
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,880
so we were just cracking up because

292
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,600
um

293
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,800
um

294
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,120
first

295
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,420
a low familiarity learner might not know

296
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,760
what these terms are or like why it's

297
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,620
relevant to even talk about this

298
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,839
situation

299
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,180
familiarity might look like knowing

300
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,959
metaphors examples intuition some

301
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,940
relevant citations or historical

302
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,360
anecdotes about this

303
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,480
the understanding in terms of what the

304
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,399
active inference formalism says about

305
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,440
this you know if it's resolved under

306
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,260
active inference then understanding that

307
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,639
resolution

308
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,620
is about the basis

309
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,839
and then from understanding there could

310
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,820
be like further developments and

311
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,800
applications

312
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,100
um and then we'll we'll come to this but

313
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,139
what was making us

314
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,279
um

315
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,320
laugh was

316
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,620
surely there are parameterizations in

317
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,380
which the rat and the teammates

318
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,360
always does one thing or always does the

319
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
other

320
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,579
so it's not that the explore exploit

321
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,160
trade-off is simply resolved under

322
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
active inference even though people

323
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,820
commonly point to things like the

324
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,320
ability to rapidly switch between

325
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,540
exploratory and exploitative behavioral

326
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,920
policies

327
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,980
because there's parameterization of that

328
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,540
model and structure learning including

329
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,260
that

330
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,660
that has to be accomplished

331
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,660
such that the model can be in a kind of

332
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,399
critical point where it behaves

333
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,200
adaptively and thus in a situation

334
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,139
manages the explore exploit

335
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,579
tension under certain constraints

336
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,139
but how could it be said that active

337
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,019
inference resolves that dilemma

338
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,740
so maybe to um whomever wrote this one

339
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,860
what is happening yes please Eric click

340
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,620
classical Eric writing here so what what

341
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,260
about this

342
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,380
uh yeah I'm I'm kind of the Heckler at

343
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,420
the garden party here you can see in

344
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,480
most of my my comments and questions

345
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,200
um

346
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,300
but yeah I mean

347
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,279
maybe it's just best to I mean it's

348
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,740
maybe a bit of red than spoken but yeah

349
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,899
I don't I don't I don't see this as a

350
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,880
valid claim that

351
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,339
they well first of all it's not a I

352
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,420
don't know why they call it a dilemma

353
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,760
for psychology it's a trade-off

354
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,500
it's been understood for years and

355
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,240
there's ways of formalizing it and you

356
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,000
solve it through optimization

357
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,600
um

358
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
it might be a dilemma for a creature

359
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,579
because they don't they don't know you

360
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,440
know what they should do but then but

361
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,220
that's not a dilemma for the field

362
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,560
and then uh I guess the other

363
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,440
other paragraph is I I don't see that

364
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,500
they offer any resolution

365
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,800
all they do is they put it into the same

366
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,720
they use a Common Language free energy

367
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,839
they put exploration in and exploitation

368
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,660
into the same equation and call it you

369
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,720
know with this information based term

370
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,760
called free energy which is perfectly

371
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,800
valid that's great but that doesn't

372
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,360
resolve the problem because as you

373
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,560
pointed out

374
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,500
you've got parameters

375
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,899
and uh the designer or somebody has to

376
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,639
figure out what those relative weights

377
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,560
are the parameters are

378
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,300
and uh so you really have an advanced

379
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,380
any you know fundamentally simply by

380
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,920
using this free energy way of expressing

381
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,779
what the trade-off is as opposed to some

382
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,500
arbitrary measure called energy or

383
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,320
preference or something like that

384
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,360
so I just think that they're that it's

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
it's it doesn't help them when they over

386
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,899
claim which is my opinion man you could

387
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,600
convince me otherwise I'm open

388
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
um but it seems to me it doesn't help

389
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,459
them by by overstating their

390
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,560
contribution to

391
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,519
um

392
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,199
resolving exploration versus

393
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,920
exploitation

394
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,959
yes very insightful I actually totally

395
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,899
agree I purposely tried to not

396
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,940
mention it as a dilemma either I think

397
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,579
tensions trade-offs

398
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,680
um these are all valid

399
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,899
um but but that's that's uh like kind of

400
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,199
micro linguistic and a more serious

401
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,660
issue is that

402
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,279
claims

403
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,620
that do crystallize out from the text

404
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,540
and things that people can copy and

405
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,360
paste and quote you know if this were a

406
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,540
um a courtroom scenario I mean did you

407
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,220
say that active inference resolves

408
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,500
exploration exploitation

409
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,299
it's gonna have the answer has to be yes

410
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,520
it was claimed in the book

411
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,640
could somebody contextualize that like

412
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,400
it's providing a first principle's way

413
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,919
where there are tunable or learnable or

414
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,079
parameter sweepable

415
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,740
um features of models that sit at a

416
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,720
really well positioned

417
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,059
uh intersection of human

418
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,179
interpretability and manifolds of

419
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,780
relevant model variation

420
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,660
yes in an extremely charitable reading

421
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,480
one could kind of bring this up from

422
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,360
back from coming off over the edge back

423
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,179
onto the table

424
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,520
that would also

425
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,179
um make active inference less surprising

426
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,980
and less

427
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,620
realistically hyperbolic

428
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,770
and be part of this process of

429

[Music]

430
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,840
um

431
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,500
seeing the evidence in the realization

432
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,880
not in the um kind of ironic

433
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,460
like we have a different partitioning

434
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,120
of a statistical variable value so

435
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,459
nice points um Brock

436
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,640
um I guess I wanted to agree

437
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,860
with that and then also maybe play a

438
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,020
little Devil's Advocate because it's

439
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,960
like uh yeah

440
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,720
we're all it's all information

441
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
so

442
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,020
it's solved

443
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,240
um that's not really

444
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,280
just because it's

445
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,740
been formulated or renamed to something

446
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,600
pragmatic value epistemic value it

447
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,740
doesn't

448
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,700
seem like that resolves it or something

449
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,760
um

450
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,240
I'm wondering if the reading of that

451
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,660
though could be that not that there is a

452
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,660
TR there is still a trade-off

453
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,960
but that the Dilemma is that

454
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,059
what they're talking about is that the

455
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,900
trade-off like when do you explore or

456
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,600
when do you exploit not that there is a

457
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,900
trade-off but that that is

458
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,460
uh this last sentence and a half here of

459
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,679
um or the resolution stems from the

460
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
minimization of free energy

461
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,679
is that whether you would seek pragmatic

462
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,980
value or epistemic value

463
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,200
is conditioned on

464
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,059
which you your model believes to be

465
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,240
the free energy minimizing

466
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,400
choice

467
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,360
um

468
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,640
though it doesn't you still have the

469
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,919
Dilemma so to speak

470
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,299
um the trade-off

471
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,340
but which side of the trade-off you take

472
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,510
is maybe result

473
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,100
[Music]

474
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,080
um

475
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,020
by generative model here or not I don't

476
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,760
know

477
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,280
is that a day sprock I think the field

478
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,640
is set for a situational resolution

479
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,700
that may be as good or maybe better than

480
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,860
other ways that it's been addressed

481
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,299
but

482
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,660
it it comes down to the exact numbers

483
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,419
that are chosen so like in the example

484
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,940
of the teammates

485
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,400
um so we can look at for example this

486
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,160
0 6 and negative 6.

487
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,900
huh

488
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,720
what if it was negative 3 000 and

489
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,460
positive three thousand

490
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,440
and so this came up in the um live

491
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,679
stream 45 with Ryan Smith on the folk

492
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,780
psychology where the intensity of the

493
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,299
preference was represented

494
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,120
and so if the preference is so if you're

495
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,080
okay we prefer having more food

496
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,539
is that going to be a thousand versus

497
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,240
zero because if so even the scantist

498
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,740
probability

499
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,740
of achieving food will be pursued in

500
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,020
other words that model is going to be

501
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,960
parameterized way way way on one side

502
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,120
and it's going to exploit only or it's

503
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,980
only going to take locally um greedy

504
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,240
Behavior

505
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,679
whereas if someone said well my behavior

506
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,480
for food is point zero zero zero zero

507
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,860
one

508
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,740
then then maybe even the most obvious

509
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,320
strategy would not be undertaken because

510
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,820
it's so close to having a flat

511
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,200
preference

512
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,140
Y is 0.01 versus 3000 why is three

513
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,960
thousand too high and 0.01 too low

514
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,020
well it has to do with like the ratios

515
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,240
and the interactions of a lot of the

516
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,280
parameters

517
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,140
so it's it's not even going to be like

518
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,740
well my preference is three comma one

519
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,539
that is going to be just like two

520
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,520
parameters being drawn out from a

521
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,460
potentially massive parameterization of

522
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,260
a model

523
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,880
and so

524
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,760
preferences of just only speaking of

525
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,039
preferences maybe

526
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,500
um very hard to compare across

527
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,179
situations because it's not like plus

528
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,440
six

529
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
for the preference for food and negative

530
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,860
six

531
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,460
is it doesn't have a semantic meaning in

532
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,320
the world it's literally a model

533
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,539
parameterization

534
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,340
and so

535
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,260
then the question becomes

536
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,400
how

537
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,360
and this framework or this way of

538
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,900
um having of combining probabilistic

539
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,020
inference and energy-based inference

540
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,539
for strategic decision making how can

541
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,539
those parameters be tuned into a region

542
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,659
of Subspace or manifold where the

543
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,179
behavior is flexible and adaptive

544
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,600
so I think the stage is prepared for a

545
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,740
first principle's resolution

546
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,340
in very charitable reading sorry yes

547
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,919
please yeah I was just going to say Ali

548
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,520
shared this paper meta control uh of the

549
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,020
exploitation

550
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,299
uh exploration exploitation it's in the

551
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,820
nearby okay chat link

552
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,799
um nice

553
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,659
but that yeah that's that is it's it's

554
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,020
not that it solves it like in some

555
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,299
Grand it eliminates exploration

556
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,760
exploitation or that it even completely

557
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,520
currently yeah it's it's just the

558
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,820
affordance I guess seems to be there to

559
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,520
explain which one why like you're going

560
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,600
through that you know there's a

561
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,059
preference heavy here or heavy there and

562
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,360
it's you know not that it's

563
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,240
it's optimal right it's not not that it

564
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,580
makes sense or it's a depth adaptable or

565
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,220
anything like that necessarily just that

566
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,400
there is some causal through line Maybe

567
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,700
yes Eric

568
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
yeah um so I want to first read Ali's

569
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,840
comment here

570
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,900
um the critical point to establish is to

571
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,059
Define

572
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,100
um action selection as a balance between

573
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,559
maximization of expected reward and

574
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,120
expected Information Gain which are

575
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,640
functionals of posterior beliefs about

576
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,700
uh late states of the world

577
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,000
um so that touches on a different one of

578
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,860
the questions which I also wrote

579
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,500
comments on which is about the team A's

580
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,620
example in particular and we'll we may I

581
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,820
don't know if we'll have time but we may

582
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,860
get to that one today

583
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,760
um

584
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,580
so but the questions specifically I I

585
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,620
want to raise about this comment or

586
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,780
maybe this I guess is a quote

587
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,280
about

588
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,780
there being a balance between

589
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,840
maximization of expected reward versus

590
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,299
expected Information Gain

591
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,840
that's one way of having a trade-off but

592
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,480
you might look for a a

593
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,919
um an agent that only wants to maximize

594
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,059
reward

595
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,940
in the long run but in order to do that

596
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,520
that entails Information Gain and that

597
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,400
therefore gives a motivation for why you

598
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
want to

599
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,020
um attend to the other term the the the

600
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,840
information based you know information

601
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,200
or learning based term or knowledge uh

602
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,720
refining of State base based term but

603
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,340
that's in the service of the larger gain

604
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,620
and that's essentially what a um uh

605
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,200
reinforcement learning is tries to do is

606
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,299
say look we're going to look ahead so

607
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,640
that uh the moves we take now will bring

608
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,740
us advantage in the future and it's you

609
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,120
know there's a time discounting and all

610
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,720
that so that doesn't that that takes

611
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,120
away the idea of information it's as

612
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,360
being a value in and of itself but it's

613
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,880
only for a purpose and so I you know

614
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,620
well there's a specific you know

615
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,880
libraries that specifically with regard

616
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,679
to the team teammates example and a

617
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,600
different question

618
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,820
yeah

619
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,400
um thank you

620
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,220
the balance between

621
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,900
pragmatic and epistemic

622
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,720
is the optimization so that is the

623
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,740
question

624
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,380
and that is the critical point

625
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,020
and that's the situational balance that

626
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,100
bottling is going to be evolving around

627
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,880
it's like some situationally

628
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,059
um optimal or preferable

629
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:27,440
strategy around that

630
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,539
is the point

631
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,539
but pointing to the point is not the

632
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,580
resolution

633
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,799
does active inference provide us a

634
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,620
natural language grounded

635
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,960
first principles approach

636
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,940
it may

637
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,919
but

638
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,080
that is also not

639
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,700
um

640
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,679
dilemma resolution

641
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,799
so on to some questions but these are

642
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,799
really great points um

643
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,840
okay

644
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,840
this is uh just an example that quite of

645
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
a type of question that I encourage

646
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,860
people especially if they're going back

647
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,659
to the earlier chapters or just whenever

648
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,120
they feel like making a contribution of

649
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,860
this kind these are like super helpful

650
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,020
questions again the questions we write

651
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,080
some of them may be included in really

652
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,360
important educational materials not the

653
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,039
least of which many further textbook

654
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,980
groups but potentially even far beyond

655
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,000
that

656
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,419
so what would you ask somebody to

657
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,580
understand

658
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,400
their comprehension of the materials

659
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,860
so I just said what are the rows columns

660
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,320
and numbers in these equations

661
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,539
and it even says it in the text it's the

662
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,340
probability of the next state

663
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,500
so the next state is in the rows

664
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,240
and then the current state is in the

665
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,500
columns

666
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,440
and this gets distributed across

667
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,500
everything so that the rows and columns

668
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,720
sum to one

669
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,600
as any other transition probability

670
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
Matrix would be expected

671
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,059
to have

672
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,159
um so we don't need to discuss it um

673
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,720
unless somebody wants to go into a

674
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,179
little more detail but this is going to

675
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,240
be at the core of that third step of the

676
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,000
recipe which is you might have the

677
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,700
structural form from the second step of

678
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,400
the recipe in chapter six

679
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,460
and then the next step is to kind of

680
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,220
specify

681
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,320
or instantiate like

682
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
in code

683
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,059
what the dimensions are

684
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,320
of

685
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,900
these matrices this is just saying like

686
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,760
they are matrices there's some prior

687
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,740
tensor Matrix

688
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,140
some hidden State some transition Matrix

689
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,419
some emission Matrix

690
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,640
and this is like the structure step two

691
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,840
of the recipe

692
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,220
step three

693
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,260
how many rows and columns

694
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,779
and as Jacob and others have been

695
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,340
exploring

696
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,320
there's the rows and Columns of the

697
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,600
analytical representation with the

698
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,220
equations

699
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,140
and then there's how Pi mdp does it

700
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,179
and there's how different computational

701
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,820
realizations do it

702
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,200
um Jacob would you want to add anything

703
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,179
about like the dimensionality of these

704
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,919
matrices it could be interesting

705
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,000
yeah I mean uh

706
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,640
I can probably speak more to how Prime

707
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,980
DB deals with the dimensionality which

708
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,120
currently is probably

709
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,159
um unnecessarily as unnecessary like

710
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,039
redundancy to them uh like if you're

711
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,740
dealing with more complex State space or

712
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,720
rather more High dimensional State space

713
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,820
and you have different modalities that

714
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,399
you want to encode in these matrices you

715
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:59,520
uh the because you're then uh

716
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,159
performing Matrix multiplications you

717
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,799
need to keep the dimensions of

718
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,559
the matrices in those given modalities

719
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,980
equal at least in time DB not in not in

720
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,840
other

721
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,640
methods as far as I'm aware

722
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
um but that means that then you have

723
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,020
Dimensions Within These matrices that

724
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,260
don't contain any information so say you

725
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,659
have a a grid that you represent

726
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,240
for the likelihood mapping of

727
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,940
observation and uh

728
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,299
state state in physical world but then

729
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,159
you have another

730
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,860
um another type of observation like

731
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,559
where is another agent located with

732
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,539
respect to you like

733
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,159
um are they in a certain direction and

734
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,760
that might be represented by uh five

735
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,640
observations say like uh they're above

736
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,899
they're below they're to the right to

737
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,659
the left or not at all then you would

738
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,899
have then you would need to encode the

739
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:04,260
observation in the 9x9 Matrix but then

740
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,179
you need to replicate it five times

741
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,419
because it's that is the same for each

742
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,820
of those relative observations but then

743
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,399
when you want to encode the likelihood

744
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,220
mapping just for the second type of

745
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,000
observation uh I'm actually not entirely

746
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,779
sure

747
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,640
what that would be what I'm presuming

748
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,580
it's going to be like five by five but

749
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,440
then replicated nine times or something

750
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,820
like that

751
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,480
um

752
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,880
just so the dimensionality matches

753
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,380
because then you're doing inference over

754
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,580
both

755
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,260
modalities

756
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,380
and at least in Prime DP you're then

757
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,700
performing

758
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,440
um

759
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,220
Matrix multiplications over both of them

760
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,000
thank you Jakob one way I'm kind of like

761
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,380
seeing that is there's the sparsity of

762
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,539
the graph

763
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,919
but then in time DP or in in any given

764
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,919
computational implementation

765
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,679
the data structures including

766
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,840
potentially like auxiliary

767
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,940
data constructs

768
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,220
may have a dimensionality

769
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,020
that reflects

770
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,539
potentially at worst

771
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,659
a combination of the dimensionality of

772
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,940
other aspects

773
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,399
as part of even just a temp file that

774
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,919
you didn't even exactly specify there

775
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,960
might be some intermediates

776
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,899
stated or unstated intermediates whose

777
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,220
dimensionality

778
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,899
isn't

779
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,240
merely the dimensionality of the

780
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,179
analytical representation

781
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,799
it's a little bit of a subtle

782
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,080
implementational point

783
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,179
but this is

784
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,120
the mountain to climb to implement these

785
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,659
kinds of models

786
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:56,220
and also just while we're on this topic

787
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,820
I think it's one area where CAD CAD is

788
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,100
going to be very interesting to explore

789
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,460
in octoblock fronts package because we

790
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,740
also can imagine that the execution

791
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,500
order of certain operations even in a

792
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,299
single agent setting not just the

793
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,700
multi-agent setting is really relevant

794
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,000
so there's that question

795
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,860
all right so

796
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,600
figure 7.2 all right so the first

797
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,299
example is about a musician playing

798
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,600
music

799
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,260
um

800
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,539
we are not aware of this example being

801
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,880
used anywhere else

802
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,399
like the citations following those this

803
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,679
musical note type representation is not

804
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,120
like shown

805
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,740
um and previously we kind of discussed

806
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,840
how some of these Trace black and white

807
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,820
images are really

808
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,679
um ambiguous

809
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,100
because of being like intersecting black

810
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,019
lines and then of course

811
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,480
the um

812
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,640
the empty Square

813
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,240
so yes can you say where those lifelines

814
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,980
come from you want to dive into that

815
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,240
right now

816
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,799
yeah

817
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,260
um well

818
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,780
okay

819
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,000
the upper left each block line even

820
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,040
though it can be hard to trace them I

821
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,940
think they're just being shown like

822
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,280
representationally

823
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,899
their

824
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,080
beliefs about each note in the sequence

825
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,760
at each time step so the time steps are

826
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
on the x-axis

827
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,960
and the um

828
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,960
the uh

829
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,839
belief in terms of a probability are on

830
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,399
the y-axis

831
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,899
so initially right so there's some

832
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,639
there's some sort of and this gets to

833
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,699
another question that was raised but

834
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,379
maybe this is time to talk about it

835
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,080
there's some sort of engine some sort of

836
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,239
differential equation same you know

837
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,560
simulator or something running

838
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,719
underneath here right that

839
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,760
is not discussed in the chapter but

840
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,460
that's generating these belief curves

841
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,640
yes yes it's related to some functions

842
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,619
in Matlab and I was just going to

843
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,320
mention that because my sense from the

844
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,619
discrete model would be you'd have

845
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,780
five let's say points

846
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,640
on time zero

847
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,180
then you'd have five points on time one

848
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,220
so I thought well what is happening with

849
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,960
this kind of like you know little

850
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,900
fractal crash right here I mean what how

851
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,160
could you have a continuously

852
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,839
differentiable

853
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,780
um oscillating type Behavior

854
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,079
when all you're calculating analytically

855
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,320
is just one two three four five

856
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,680
then I thought is it meaning is is the

857
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,220
are the points actually at the midpoint

858
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,320
and there's a differential equation

859
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,320
that's sort of like ribboning

860
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,900
an action perception Loop through a

861
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,880
discrete time Matrix

862
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,280
but then

863
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,579
if this is a function that's evaluatable

864
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,280
at every point

865
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,780
aren't we in a continuous time setting

866
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,079
so wouldn't that have to imply

867
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,599
like a machinery for unpacking a

868
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,300
continuous time action perception cycle

869
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,980
from discrete time specification

870
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,380
so I agree

871
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,040
very much yeah

872
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,680
good yeah my guess is what they do is

873
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,079
they they've got their um you know these

874
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,460
equations if the free energy equations

875
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,440
and the the parameters are these

876
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,180
distributions okay what's your belief in

877
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,780
these different properties and

878
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,760
um those parameters evolve over time

879
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
through a differential equation because

880
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,660
you turn this you turn these things into

881
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,640
a differential equation and when you

882
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,079
change when you change the state

883
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,579
something like okay now we've got

884
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,859
another note comes in then that's what's

885
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,020
going to trigger

886
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,480
um the differential equation to go in a

887
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,680
different direction essentially and

888
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,880
that's what that's why you've got the

889
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,380
five discrete

890
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,220
kind of

891
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,200
um

892
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,480
regimes here or you know um Target

893
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,440
um

894
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,220
Target points that it kind of evolves to

895
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,500
um and then you know the next note comes

896
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,380
in and it now the boundary conditions

897
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,240
change essentially so your differential

898
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,440
equation takes you in a different

899
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,380
direction so I and I I recall that

900
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,420
there's something like um

901
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,700
you know you guys probably discussed

902
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,680
this more more than I paid attention but

903
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,020
there's some sort of universal solver

904
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,119
that they're providing

905
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,880
um so you just plug in your um State

906
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,760
your your Matrix matrices your

907
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,480
um

908
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,859
State equations or

909
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,960
your transition matrices and then it'll

910
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,460
solve it all for you and that may be

911
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,500
what this differential equation solver

912
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,540
is is about you think that that sounds

913
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,320
right

914
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,980
yes I think the um

915
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,980
yes when whenever variously in the

916
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,359
method sections and supplemental

917
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,540
sections of paper they'll say here in

918
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,280
the paper we're only specifying the

919
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,740
generative model and the matrices and

920
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,500
then we use standard routines to address

921
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,320
it now I don't think that has the um

922
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,660
it's not the Pinnacle of accessibility

923
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,280
and reproducibility

924
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,560
however it does at least use standard

925
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
routines but again those are not always

926
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,880
specified in the paper which is um an

927
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,780
issue

928
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,599
so it'll be important to regenerate

929
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,260
examples within SPM

930
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,020
and then also to use some of these

931
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,760
things that we were discussing with like

932
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,380
the ability to move between different

933
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,000
languages

934
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,500
um but like vbx variational Bayes X I

935
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,839
don't know what the x is actually for

936
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,460
um it is very it's one of the core

937
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,160
functions it is actually doing the

938
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,680
variational inference in SPM

939
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,859
and again SPM is like this sort of like

940
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,500
Chimera package because it arose

941
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,599
from the immediacies of needing to do

942
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,420
neuroimaging registration and dynamical

943
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,680
Analysis

944
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,740
that then broached into Dynamic causal

945
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,480
modeling

946
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,640
um random field Theory based statistical

947
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,180
testing permutation testing all these

948
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,040
areas that are not

949
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,280
um themselves formally linked per se but

950
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,099
rather useful as part of the toolkit of

951
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,420
a neuroimaging researcher

952
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,260
then

953
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,240
just as we were a little bit discussing

954
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,020
in

955
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,420
um like chapter two and of course many

956
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,040
times earlier

957
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,800
in that generalized Bayesian inferential

958
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,560
framework hierarchical modeling

959
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
including action

960
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,339
is actually not

961
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,200
the hardest thing

962
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,460
yes

963
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,520
implementing action is one thing but

964
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,640
treating action selection as inference

965
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,320
planning as inference it has some uh

966
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,660
challenges that arise

967
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,520
relative to Just Doing Time series

968
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,920
anticipation

969
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,339
um but then those functions became

970
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:19,260
compiled into SPM in a limited capacity

971
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,880
um so

972
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,859
they again they go through some of this

973
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,260
but but I think it's it's a key issue

974
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,119
um Ali we'll definitely look forward to

975
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,200
what the um free energy gradients are

976
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,760
um

977
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,820
but like what

978
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,000
where the continuous nature of these

979
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,619
curves and like why there are the

980
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,060
numbers that there are

981
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,660
one two three four five six seven eight

982
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,280
nine ten

983
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,079
now there's five notes

984
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,520
ten is two times five

985
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,160
like it's just there's a little bit more

986
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,000
that needs to be fleshed out there

987
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,119
um

988
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,800
and then one question that was like

989
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,660
again somewhere between testing or

990
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,960
comprehension and being clear about what

991
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,300
we're doing here

992
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,000
um and in this ambiguity we can ask it

993
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,420
without any bias

994
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,000
um the negative free energy gradients

995
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,180
I.E prediction errors

996
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,920
uh what

997
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,900
is a prediction error a free energy

998
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,240
calculation

999
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,880
well ignore a gradient for a second

1000
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,380
free energy calculations are not

1001
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,240
prediction errors prediction errors are

1002
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,359
observations minus expectations so this

1003
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,460
is like some finite value in the state

1004
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,740
space of what is being measured

1005
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,460
free energy is not that it references

1006
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,079
potentially those variables but it does

1007
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,400
things that we know about like KL

1008
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,740
divergences and such okay so free energy

1009
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,320
is not prediction error and that's a

1010
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,980
huge difference between for example a um

1011
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,460
predictive processing framework

1012
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,460
and a free energy hierarchical

1013
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,440
predictive architecture

1014
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,760
Eric

1015
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,740
but they're saying the gradient and free

1016
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,780
energy is a prediction error

1017
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,540
exactly so even if it were that's then

1018
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,740
that was that was the next question

1019
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,599
which was what's the difference between

1020
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,920
free energy and the free energy

1021
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,280
gradients are we talking about a

1022
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,079
landscape

1023
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,760
of derivatives of free Energies

1024
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,619
or are we talking about what here like

1025
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,560
is it being described as a gradient as a

1026
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,760
landscape

1027
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,820
and hence gradient-ish because it can be

1028
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,099
calculated over

1029
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,380
some

1030
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,520
discrete bi-continuous State space

1031
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,619
it's like five skyscrapers that you

1032
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,260
could have derivatives over

1033
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,060
in the y direction but you couldn't take

1034
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,700
the partial X

1035
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,319
or is it truly

1036
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,099
um or is it a continuous landscape

1037
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,560
that's just being tethered

1038
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,480
to the discrete values in X but then

1039
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,740
again that's the whole continuous

1040
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,940
discrete question

1041
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,220
or are the values

1042
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,319
gradients

1043
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,420
which has an even more complex

1044
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,460
interpretation

1045
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,020
so

1046
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,700
we don't have the answers on these but

1047
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,078
the these um

1048
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,400
it's hard to understand how these

1049
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,140
figures could have epistemic or

1050
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,680
pragmatic value for Learners or

1051
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,500
practitioners without some of these

1052
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,540
questions being resolved

1053
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:43,079
um

1054
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,599
all right

1055
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,480
um the first example this is just kind

1056
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,119
of from this from walking through so the

1057
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,640
first example was just hidden Markov

1058
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,540
model

1059
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,760
hidden States updating Through Time

1060
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Bayesian filter common filter this is

1061
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,020
like just standard signal processing and

1062
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,819
a Bayesian framework

1063
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,099
um and we're going to see a lot of

1064
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,319
Echoes of the step-by-step model stream

1065
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,200
one they give an even simpler example

1066
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,180
with static perception One Step

1067
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,380
perception

1068
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,880
and then

1069
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,359
um go second to the dynamic case

1070
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:22,260
then introduce action Pi policy and then

1071
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,420
Nuance policy through like uncertainty

1072
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,339
and so on

1073
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:30,119
um so that's the first inferential case

1074
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,099
they're then going to head into decision

1075
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:34,380
making and planning as inference

1076
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,660
so

1077
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,740
um

1078
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,740
we see policy being introduced as a

1079
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,720
variable that

1080
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,500
um

1081
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,599
influences how States change Through

1082
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,839
Time

1083
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,119
does policy do that or does Action do

1084
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,099
that

1085
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,859
in the one step limit

1086
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,579
policies our actions are affordances

1087
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,859
but Pi is specifically reserved for

1088
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,420
sequences of actions so is it that

1089
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,240
sequences of actions like do that or is

1090
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,480
it um you know is this the actual base

1091
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,940
topology

1092
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,460
um but nonetheless that architecture

1093
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,160
allows the evaluation

1094
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,740
of alternate policies in terms of their

1095
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,560
relative expect uh variational or

1096
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,300
expected free energy depending on

1097
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,680
whether a one-step policy is

1098
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,599
accomplishable with variational free

1099
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,480
energy that's like the instantaneous

1100
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,859
move

1101
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:35,160
most consistent instantaneous maneuver

1102
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,400
versus even one step in advance

1103
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,380
is going to Broach into this whole

1104
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,040
expected free energy space

1105
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,980
um we had on 130

1106
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,420
um so uh there's a really uh important

1107
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,280
discussion

1108
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,839
um Ozaki is also very interesting

1109
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,960
researcher neural rhythms and so on

1110
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,079
um

1111
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,760
factorization is a really important

1112
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
topic

1113
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,300
and being able to distinguish like

1114
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,040
neurologically what do we mean when we

1115
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,660
talk about the what and the where stream

1116
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,180
the dorsal and the ventral stream and

1117
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,280
critiques of it Etc but just what and

1118
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,260
where in the brain

1119
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,980
and um then in the factor graphs and

1120
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,140
computationally

1121
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,500
because the unfactorized models

1122
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,180
if we're just doing the all by all by

1123
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,540
all by all those become intractable very

1124
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,560
fast

1125
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,680
and the specification of the sparsity of

1126
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,640
the model

1127
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,040
is one of the same in the variational

1128
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,920
base framework as the factorization

1129
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,480
of the model

1130
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,460
so factorization is like kind of

1131
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,500
focusing your search efforts on

1132
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,760
manifolds

1133
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,380
where you've constrained certain things

1134
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,780
to be like linked or unlinked

1135
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,700
that is what motivates the structure

1136
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,380
learning problem

1137
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,380
and the um need to have

1138
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,480
um to not be locked into factorization

1139
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,339
schemes

1140
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,819
at a given level of analysis

1141
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,819
um

1142
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,760
okay

1143
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,680
another just uh

1144
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,680
question to to explore

1145
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,260
um like here

1146
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,940
we have the top of a half a figure four

1147
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,040
three there's just one a matrix

1148
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,099
so why are there two a matrices here

1149
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,079
well it's not not an impossible question

1150
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,640
and the symbols go a long way

1151
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,920
here's the four locations that the

1152
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,680
animal can be in starting position

1153
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,420
bottom position left arm or right arm

1154
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,800
then

1155
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,819
here are the the it's five on The X here

1156
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:02,160
because that bottom

1157
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,880
can could reveal an r or reveal an l

1158
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,980
in this case it reveals an R

1159
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,660
and the food is honestly there

1160
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,200
and then this is a second a matrix

1161
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,160
that is um describing how location

1162
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,560
is associated with

1163
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,440
the food

1164
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,359
non-abversive or positive

1165
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,740
but this ties into the earlier

1166
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,060
discussion like

1167
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,800
it might be all one thing to say well

1168
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,900
it's um four by five and then four by

1169
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,520
three

1170
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,880
but is this actually a four by five by

1171
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,240
three

1172
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,540
it can't be I I know it's not

1173
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,400
Eric what do you think

1174
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,380
yeah um and they mentioned and then

1175
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,720
there's a tensor also

1176
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,119
um which and the tensor means that

1177
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,060
you're stacking this one

1178
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,940
uh this image against the version where

1179
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,200
the um reward is on the the left side so

1180
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,740
the tensor is going to be four by uh

1181
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,720
eight by two

1182
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,119
so that makes sense for being the tensor

1183
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,040
so this the state is another layer on

1184
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,540
top of this the hidden State there's

1185
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,180
another layer on top of that

1186
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,839
yes

1187
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:21,359
[Music]

1188
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,359
um

1189
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,160
section seven three so this would be a

1190
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,599
fun

1191
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,400
you know

1192
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,640
um kind of like PhD qualifying level

1193
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,440
question

1194
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,960
just describe the whole team Ace

1195
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,180
every row every column

1196
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,040
and every value

1197
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,060
why is it that way

1198
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,180
so we're not going to type it out here

1199
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,260
but

1200
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,619
that is to understand that that example

1201
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:58,740
and what what the B matrices are and

1202
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,819
just what what and and to have

1203
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:04,680
agility and just identifying the

1204
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,940
differences between these matrices

1205
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,160
numerically like pattern recognition

1206
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,020
like oh here there's two ones here two

1207
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,300
zeros here two zero zero two ones here

1208
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,880
one and zero these stay the same

1209
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,099
and then to be able to transpose that in

1210
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,780
your understanding

1211
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,760
to what this means in terms of

1212
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,160
transition frequencies

1213
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,260
every

1214
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,720
place where there's a difference

1215
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,040
it's a difference that makes a

1216
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,060
difference

1217
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,040
so being able to understand what those

1218
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,180
are

1219
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,940
is about understanding this example

1220
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,400
and one can imagine especially if

1221
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,740
they're wanting to make a application of

1222
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,119
active inference that's more complex

1223
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,060
than this 4x4

1224
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,099
being fluent

1225
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,839
with

1226
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:52,020
how these matrices are constructed their

1227
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,440
dimensionality how differences in the

1228
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,440
generative process are Incorporated how

1229
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,880
differences in the generative model are

1230
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,920
Incorporated all these different

1231
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,819
features are important

1232
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,960
um this is yes Eric this is definitely

1233
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,520
very important

1234
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,700
um question agreed like

1235
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,380
it it looks

1236
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,960
extremely neural

1237
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,780
this has and they these traces come up

1238
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,319
all the time

1239
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,540
um similarly here

1240
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,780
we have three discrete time points

1241
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,220
starting

1242
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,680
going to the queue getting the L

1243
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,819
and then going to the left arm

1244
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:42,420
but then what is a step one and a half

1245
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,760
is the one

1246
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,579
all of these points

1247
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,559
and then by two

1248
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,720
their uncertainty is resolved the belief

1249
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,160
about certain things goes to zero the

1250
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,380
belief about the things goes to one

1251
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,180
and this is just a pure interpolation

1252
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,920
but

1253
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,579
that is quite a specific interpolation

1254
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:04,380
including what appear to be some like

1255
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,319
dopaminergic spikes or something that

1256
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,059
are not reflected at either of the time

1257
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,020
points

1258
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,000
my guess is that you've got three

1259
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,800
different blocks there so if you take

1260
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,500
the one as being the width you know

1261
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,500
one-third of the way across the two is

1262
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,760
another third and the three is another

1263
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,400
third then that switch there that you

1264
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,960
see happens as soon as you transition

1265
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,099
from the one to the two

1266
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:31,380
yes

1267
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,859
oh although still there's even the

1268
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,500
graphical interpolation

1269
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,800
question like and it's just it's so it's

1270
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,079
it's so easy to be like reading

1271
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:45,839
you know just is it just a quirk of the

1272
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,940
dashed line

1273
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,540
but is it are there two dashed lines and

1274
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,599
one two dashed lines diverged in a

1275
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,520
neural Trace

1276
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,280
um so it but it's um it's it's kind of

1277
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,720
clear these ones the discrete

1278
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,680
formulations are clearer

1279
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,520
are rats prone to useless Behavior what

1280
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,900
do you think

1281
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,099
what useless Behavior

1282
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,280
I I wrote it out okay okay yeah this is

1283
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,839
good maybe we'll have time for today but

1284
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,180
that's my most provocative

1285
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,980
comment on this one and maybe we can

1286
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,359
save that for next week

1287
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,359
okay perfect let's pick up with this one

1288
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,619
um and any other

1289
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:32,940
questions then we'll um glance over the

1290
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,339
visual cicade look at the learning

1291
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:36,839
example

1292
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,059
consider the hierarchical example

1293
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:41,160
there's the maze then there's the

1294
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,339
hierarchical example another

1295
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:47,700
nested discrete meets neural continuous

1296
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,040
Trace

1297
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,280
and then we end on 7 squared so

1298
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,780
thank you all

1299
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,980
have an excellent day
