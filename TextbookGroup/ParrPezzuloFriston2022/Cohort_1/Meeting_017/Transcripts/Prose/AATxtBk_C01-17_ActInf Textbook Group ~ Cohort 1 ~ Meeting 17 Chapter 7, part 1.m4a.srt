1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,330
Welcome. It's cohort one meeting,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,174
17 already. And it's September 23,

3
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:11,370
2022. We're having our first discussion

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,190
of chapter seven in the textbook.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,086
Well, we have many ways to

6
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:22,958
go. We have questions on chapter seven

7
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:26,230
that people have been adding.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,554
We also have some summaries

9
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:35,206
and overviews and can walk through the

10
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:38,442
text directly. But first, does anyone

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,262
want to just raise their hand or unmute

12
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:43,674
and give any thought that they had on

13
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,006
chapter seven, their experience reading

14
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:49,158
it, their understanding of where it's

15
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,934
situated in the textbook overall, what

16
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:54,506
was in it, or what was not in it, et

17
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:55,150
cetera?

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,270
Okay, well,

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,352
open again. Please raise your hands or

20
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,180
write in the chat if you want to address

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,910
anything at any point. I want to open

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,900
by acknowledging a lot of the

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,044
contributions Ali made and in

24
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,744
some conversations that he and I had

25
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:49,536
earlier this week that I believe all of

26
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,576
you cohort wanderers will find

27
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:56,608
interesting. But first,

28
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:58,412
let's just start with this quotation.

29
00:01:58,476 --> 00:01:59,516
We're going to start with the opening

30
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:01,636
quotation of the chapter. Then I'm going

31
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:04,496
to surface some discussions with Ali,

32
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,340
and then we're going to go into some

33
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,316
details of the chapter. So the quote is,

34
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,676
What I cannot create, I do not

35
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:15,124
understand by RF. So what

36
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:18,384
does anyone think about that quotation?

37
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:21,300
Or what does it mean in this context?

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,530
Um.

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,304
I think I mean,

40
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,652
it's more applicable.

41
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:39,340
Applicable? Applicable.

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,764
The more complex. The thing

43
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:48,492
is that you're trying to build. But what

44
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:51,372
priors or what way could your Generative

45
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:55,680
Model create an accurate prediction

46
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,370
of the operation of something or the

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,364
underlying dynamics of something if you

48
00:03:03,402 --> 00:03:10,368
do not kind of step by step generate

49
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,276
the affordance, take the actions that

50
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:15,972
generate those affordances, I don't see

51
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:18,310
any causal path to doing that.

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,648
You would have to step through it

53
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:26,752
necessarily, if it's computationally

54
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,740
complex.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,550
So that's most things in the world.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,548
But yeah, awesome.

57
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,870
It's like this is the low road answer.

58
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,880
Like, how can the Generative Model have

59
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,688
anything like understanding without

60
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,688
generating? You can't just have it on

61
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:52,256
the shelf. And then someone has added

62
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:55,888
a mild answer. We can't

63
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:59,380
have understanding just

64
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,364
through mental envisioning that

65
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:05,268
the algorithms need to be implemented

66
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:08,728
for a learner's journey. And then

67
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:12,068
this is also an even deeper or stronger

68
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:15,876
point, which Friston

69
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,796
and others have been working on for a

70
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,920
long time, which is like it's sentient

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,284
artifacts in the world that

72
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:27,896
will be the realization of active

73
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:32,044
inference. It's not just like some nice

74
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:34,690
derivations. Brock and anyone else.

75
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,104
I was just going to add something about

76
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,696
hidden states. There again, coming back

77
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,080
to computational complexity, but there's

78
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,660
things now that we're starting to build

79
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,516
that we don't really 100% understand all

80
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,516
of the dynamics of what is or just in

81
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:52,896
general. We invent things that we don't

82
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,512
completely understand first. And then

83
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:59,096
based on the observational, based on the

84
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:01,720
evidence that we observe, that it is

85
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,020
consistently exhibiting some behavior

86
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,900
that directs our attention that directs

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,100
where our generative model pursues

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,744
more observations. But we're

89
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,476
definitely getting towards a point where

90
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,864
that's kind of no longer going to be

91
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:25,616
possible in the way that we usually try

92
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:27,730
to use math to just shortcut stuff,

93
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,536
where the operation of the dynamics of

94
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,884
the things that we're going to build are

95
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:36,980
necessarily going to be the proof.

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,700
Their existence will be their own proof.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,320
Awesome. Okay, so just fun starting

98
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,304
quotation upload. That one for sure,

99
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:52,440
though there's some detailed things

100
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,090
about the

101
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,004
examples and

102
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,052
some of these I've been working on.

103
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:05,612
Everyone is welcome for every chapter to

104
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:08,252
be contributing on these pages. Like

105
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,096
kind of just trying to overview what

106
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:13,040
these examples are because a chapter,

107
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,896
it states it up front, yet I missed it

108
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,728
the first several times reading. It like

109
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,252
these illustrated models of every color

110
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:26,816
in the rainbow are the section titles,

111
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,396
and those are the functionalities that

112
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:32,884
are getting layered in sometimes

113
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,100
building on the same model. Like there's

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,888
like Team A's version one and then

115
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,304
there's Team A's version two. Other

116
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:41,832
times it's switching between models or

117
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:43,256
showing two different models that

118
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,852
illustrate the same cognitive

119
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,548
functionality. Other times the

120
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,772
simulation outputs are shown, other

121
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,268
times they're not. So there's like a lot

122
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:55,928
of heterogeneity in the observations

123
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:59,096
in this chapter, but it really wasn't

124
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,736
until I saw that these first

125
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:06,396
paragraph words were the section titles

126
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,924
that it made more sense how the chapter

127
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:12,356
was being laid out. So that's just kind

128
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:15,060
of one note.

129
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,744
Ali, do you want to raise any thoughts

130
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,952
or describe a little bit about our

131
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:28,104
discussion on how we're going to move

132
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:29,400
forward on the equations?

133
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,858
Okay. If you unmute, then go for it.

134
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:41,270
Otherwise okay.

135
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,206
Yes. No, Mike. Thank you. Ellie. All

136
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,142
good. So we were

137
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:50,070
discussing how there are several layers.

138
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,754
As with other scriptural traditions,

139
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:56,646
there's levels of readings. So there's

140
00:07:56,678 --> 00:08:00,140
a level of reading that is even

141
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,554
more granular or below where we've been

142
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:07,146
currently targeting. Like, here's

143
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,590
equation 25, there's a reading

144
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,326
for accessibility and understanding that

145
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,982
would potentially be like F open square

146
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:19,278
bracket, q comma y closed bracket equals

147
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,242
negative sign expectation over Q, open

148
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:25,700
parentheses, et cetera. So it's like the

149
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,530
reading of the notation.

150
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,050
Then the notation can be substituted

151
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,254
for terms in the active ontology, which

152
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,634
is like the level that's being described

153
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:43,000
here, but this is not to be seen here.

154
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,618
This is the level where notation could

155
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:51,210
be aligned across papers because their

156
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,466
notational reading would be different,

157
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,558
but then they might be referring to the

158
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,394
same exact composition of the active

159
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:02,126
ontology. Then once the

160
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,670
ontology definition has been squared,

161
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,770
the terms could be condensed into

162
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,142
meaningful units like accuracy,

163
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:14,210
complexity, risk, expected risk

164
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,420
that gives symbolic in the more

165
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,310
conversational sense rather than in the

166
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,146
notational sense. And then that's

167
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:29,922
where memes and themes and rhetoric

168
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,866
around what active inference formalisms

169
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:35,690
say start to arise.

170
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,770
And then there's the consequences of

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,386
changes in relationships within and

172
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:44,458
outside the formalism because it's kind

173
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,786
of like there's this larger structure

174
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:51,134
for like a POMDP and changing one

175
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,742
variable. If you're only looking at one

176
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:56,590
view or one kind of sub formalism,

177
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,674
turn it up to eleven yet that might

178
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,494
influence other variables that aren't

179
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:05,346
part of that formalism itself. And so

180
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:08,146
this is like a very open question that

181
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,506
touches on everything from the

182
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:14,226
implications of changes to relationships

183
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,934
that aren't formally specified. For

184
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:18,658
example, the Bayes graph, the edges

185
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,358
reflect a certain type of relationship

186
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:23,802
as we've explored, but changes from

187
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,642
one can propagate throughout a whole

188
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:27,946
system, potentially in nonlinear ways.

189
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,634
So it's always going to be this kind of

190
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,060
open area.

191
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,340
How changes,

192
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,938
including counterfactuals about the

193
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,954
formalism, what if risk were situated

194
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:43,406
this way instead of that way? Or how

195
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,246
does that relate in this case? So this

196
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,022
is kind of an open one. Again, people

197
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,680
please update it and modify it.

198
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,274
But some of these equations which

199
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:57,506
we'll get to. So we'll come to why we

200
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,178
had that conversation in a 7.8 later.

201
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:02,760
But that was like one really interesting

202
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,080
conversation. And then

203
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:23,200
there was one other okay,

204
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,154
then just to kind of jump into a chapter

205
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:30,034
seven topic but also kind

206
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:33,726
of reframe our learning journey

207
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,906
as we're all working through this for

208
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,498
the first time in the textbook group.

209
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,250
So they wrote,

210
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,390
um,

211
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,206
this choice in the teammates and then

212
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,726
Eric or anyone else. I know that you had

213
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:52,758
some questions on the teammates, or we

214
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,494
can go to the earlier examples, but this

215
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,846
choice of what to do do you seek out the

216
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,278
informative queue and then go to the arm

217
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:01,846
that you've now reduced your uncertainty

218
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:03,738
about where the reward is? So do you

219
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,978
take an epistemic action and then have a

220
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,546
better chance of making the

221
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:10,686
pragmatically good choice or do you just

222
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:13,006
go and make the pragmatic choice? Do you

223
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:14,846
take one step up or do you take one step

224
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,014
back for two steps up? It speaks to the

225
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,986
exploration exploitation dilemma in

226
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,706
psychology and machine learning. A

227
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,606
dilemma that's resolved under active

228
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:28,354
inference. So we were just cracking up

229
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:32,600
because first

230
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,438
a low familiarity learner might not know

231
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,754
what these terms are or like why it's

232
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,582
relevant to even talk about this

233
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:41,240
situation.

234
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,174
Familiarity might look like knowing

235
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,140
metaphors, examples, intuition, some

236
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,934
relevant citations or historical

237
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,100
anecdotes about this.

238
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,374
The understanding in terms of what the

239
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:59,374
active inference formalism says about

240
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,818
this, if it's resolved under active

241
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,174
inference then understanding that

242
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:07,886
resolution is about the basis and

243
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,954
then from understanding there could be

244
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:11,842
like further developments and

245
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:15,422
applications and then we'll

246
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:18,660
come to this. But what was making us

247
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,494
laugh was surely there are

248
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:26,358
parameterizations in which the rat and

249
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:29,494
the teammates always does one thing

250
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:32,978
or always does the other. So it's

251
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:36,282
not that the explore exploit trade off

252
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,566
is simply resolved under active

253
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,806
inference even though people commonly

254
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,266
point to things like the ability to

255
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,218
rapidly switch between exploratory and

256
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,518
exploitative behavioral policies because

257
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:50,062
there's parameterization of that model

258
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,078
and structure learning including that

259
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:55,294
that has to be accomplished such that

260
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,882
the model can be in a kind of critical

261
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:00,146
point where it behaves adaptively and

262
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,286
thus in a situation manages the explore

263
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:05,970
exploit tension under

264
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,426
certain constraints. But how could it be

265
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,374
said that active inference resolves that

266
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:15,362
dilemma? So maybe to whomever

267
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,374
wrote this one? What is happening? Yes,

268
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:21,394
please. Eric, classical Eric writing

269
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:23,800
here. So what about this?

270
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,266
Yeah, I'm kind of the heckler at the

271
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,426
garden party here. You can see in most

272
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:34,426
of my comments and questions but

273
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,946
yeah, maybe it's just best to I mean

274
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,606
it's maybe better read than spoken but

275
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:43,882
yeah, I don't see this as a valid claim

276
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,878
that they well, first of all,

277
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:48,346
I don't know why they call it a dilemma

278
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,054
for psychology. It's a trade off. It's

279
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,686
been understood for years and there's

280
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:54,578
ways of formalizing it and you solve it

281
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:58,338
through optimization. It might be a

282
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,686
dilemma for a creature because they

283
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,294
don't know what they should do, but

284
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:06,760
that's not a dilemma for the field.

285
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,670
And then I guess the other paragraph is

286
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,034
I don't see that they offer any

287
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:18,346
resolution. All they do is they put it

288
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:20,682
into the same they use a common

289
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,506
language, free energy. They put

290
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:25,338
exploration and exploitation into the

291
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:28,814
same equation and call it with this

292
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,294
information based term called free

293
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,386
energy which is perfectly valid. That's

294
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,246
great. But that doesn't resolve the

295
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,200
problem because as you pointed out,

296
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,346
you've got parameters and the

297
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:43,218
designer or somebody has to figure out

298
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:45,026
what those relative weights are, the

299
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:48,786
parameters are. And so

300
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:52,214
you really haven't advanced anything

301
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:56,454
fundamentally, simply by using this

302
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:59,158
free energy way of expressing what the

303
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,646
trade off is as opposed to some

304
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,640
arbitrary measure called energy or

305
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,786
preference or something like that. So I

306
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,394
just think that it doesn't help them

307
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,406
when they overclaim, which is my opinion

308
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,326
and you can convince me otherwise, I'm

309
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,054
open. But it seems to me it doesn't help

310
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:21,082
them by overstating their contribution

311
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,282
to resolving

312
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:26,270
exploration versus exploitation.

313
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,926
Yes, very insightful. I actually totally

314
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,322
agree. I purposely tried to not mention

315
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:35,954
it as a dilemma either. I think

316
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:39,298
tensions, trade offs, these are all

317
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:43,314
valid but that's kind of micro

318
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:47,622
linguistic and a more serious issue is

319
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:51,810
that claims that do crystallized

320
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,574
out from the text and things that people

321
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,586
can copy and paste and quote if this

322
00:16:56,608 --> 00:17:00,474
were a courtroom scenario did you

323
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,310
say that active inference resolves

324
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,818
exploration exploitation? The answer has

325
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,080
to be yes, it was claimed in the book.

326
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,870
Could somebody contextualize that like

327
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,366
it's providing a first principles way

328
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,782
where there are tunable or learnable or

329
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:21,438
parameter sweepable features of models

330
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,370
that sit at a really well positioned

331
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,130
intersection of human interpretability

332
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,622
and manifolds of relevant model

333
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,586
variation? Yes, in an extremely

334
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,622
charitable reading one could kind of

335
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:41,586
bring this from coming off over the edge

336
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,830
back onto the table.

337
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,806
That would also make active

338
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:52,300
inference less surprising and less

339
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,606
realistically hyperbolic and be

340
00:17:56,628 --> 00:18:01,518
part of this process of seeing

341
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,790
the evidence in the realization,

342
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,110
not in the kind of ironic

343
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,794
like we have a different partitioning of

344
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:15,794
a statistical variable value. So nice

345
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,650
points Brock.

346
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,974
I guess I wanted to agree with

347
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,846
that and then also maybe play a little

348
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,190
devil's advocate,

349
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,470
it's all information so solved

350
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,794
just because it's been formulated or

351
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,634
renamed to something pragmatic value,

352
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:47,646
epistemic value, it doesn't seem like

353
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:49,920
that resolves it or something.

354
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,182
I'm wondering if the reading of that

355
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:01,506
though could be not that there

356
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:04,690
is still a trade off but that the

357
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,906
dilemma. Is that what they're talking

358
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:11,310
about is that the trade off, like when

359
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,194
do you explore or when do you exploit?

360
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:17,030
Not that there is a trade off but that

361
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,314
is this last sentence

362
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:24,870
and a half here. The resolution

363
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,474
stems from the minimization of free

364
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:29,674
energy. Is that whether you

365
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:32,794
would seek pragmatic value or

366
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:36,780
epistemic value is conditioned on

367
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,640
which your model believes to be

368
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,110
the free energy minimizing choice

369
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,966
though you still have the dilemma, so to

370
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:55,762
speak, or the trade off. But which side

371
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:59,186
of the trade off you take is

372
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,490
maybe resolved.

373
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,806
By a. Generative model here or not, I

374
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:10,498
don't know. Thanks Brock.

375
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,678
I think the field is set for a

376
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,834
situational resolution that may be as

377
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,282
good or maybe better than other ways

378
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:21,994
that it's been addressed but it

379
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:25,194
comes down to the exact numbers that are

380
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,726
chosen. So like in the example of the

381
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:31,646
teammates. So we

382
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:36,046
can look at for example this zero

383
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,680
six and negative six.

384
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,642
What if it was negative 3000 and

385
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,586
positive 3000? And so this came up in

386
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,946
the live stream 45 with Ryan Smith on

387
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:51,514
the folk psychology where the intensity

388
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:54,614
of the preference was represented. And

389
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:58,242
so if the preference is so we prefer

390
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:02,022
having more food, is that

391
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:04,634
going to be 1000 versus zero? Because if

392
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:08,122
so even the scantest probability of

393
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,874
achieving food will be pursued. In other

394
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:13,066
words, that model is going to be

395
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,394
parameterized way, way on one side and

396
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:18,206
it's going to exploit only or it's only

397
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,986
going to take locally greedy behavior.

398
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,634
Whereas if someone said well my behavior

399
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:26,766
for food is zero zero one then

400
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:29,754
maybe even the most obvious strategy

401
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,746
would not be undertaken because it's so

402
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,594
close to having a flat preference. Why

403
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:37,858
is zero one versus why is 3000 too high

404
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:40,946
and zero one too low? Well it has to do

405
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,258
with the ratios and the interactions

406
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,990
of a lot of the parameters.

407
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,286
So it's not even going to be like well

408
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,800
my preference is three comma one.

409
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,522
That is going to be just like two

410
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,522
parameters being drawn out from a

411
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:59,386
potentially massive parameterization of

412
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:03,770
a model. And so preferences

413
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,600
just only speaking of preferences may be

414
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,066
very hard to compare across situations

415
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:13,966
because it's not like plus six for the

416
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:16,320
preference for food and negative six.

417
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,306
It doesn't have a semantic meaning in

418
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:22,322
the world. It's literally a model

419
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:26,722
parameterization. And so then

420
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,370
the question becomes how can this

421
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,678
framework or this way of having

422
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:37,894
of combining probabilistic inference and

423
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:40,834
energy based inference for strategic

424
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:42,742
decision making, how can those

425
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,594
parameters be tuned into a region of

426
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:49,030
subspace or manifold where the behavior

427
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,106
is flexible and adaptive? So I think the

428
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:55,206
stage is prepared for a first principles

429
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:59,784
resolution in

430
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:02,648
charitable reading. Sorry. Yes, please.

431
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:05,156
Yeah, I was just going to say Ali shared

432
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:08,424
this paper meta control of the

433
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:11,640
exploitation exploration exploitation.

434
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,470
It's in the nearby chat link. Nice.

435
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,092
But yeah, it's not that it solves it

436
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:23,564
like in some grand it eliminates

437
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:26,000
exploration exploitation or that it even

438
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,136
completely currently it's just

439
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,896
the affordance, I guess seems to be

440
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:34,256
there to explain which one

441
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:36,020
why. Like you're going through that

442
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,336
there's a preference heavy here or heavy

443
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:42,020
there and it's not that it's

444
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,108
base optimal, right? It's not that it

445
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:47,524
makes sense or it's adaptable or

446
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:49,112
anything like that necessarily, just

447
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,880
that there is some causal through line,

448
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,400
maybe. Yes. Eric yeah,

449
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,844
so I want to first read Ali's comment

450
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:03,112
here. The critical point to establish

451
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:07,288
is to define action selection

452
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,564
as a balance between maximalization of

453
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:11,260
expected reward and expected information

454
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,012
gain which are functionals of posterior

455
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:16,176
beliefs about latent states of the

456
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:20,816
world. So that touches on one

457
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:22,876
of the questions which I also wrote

458
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,992
comments on, which is about the team,

459
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,596
a's example in particular, and I

460
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:29,556
don't know if we'll have time, but we

461
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,110
may get to that one today.

462
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,828
But the questions specifically I want to

463
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,168
raise about this comment, or maybe I

464
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,704
guess this is a quote about there

465
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:44,152
being a balance between maximization of

466
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:46,692
expected reward versus expected

467
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:49,736
information gain. That's one way of

468
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:52,684
having a trade off. But you might look

469
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:56,460
for an agent that only

470
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,524
wants to maximize reward in the

471
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:03,184
long run, but in order to do that, that

472
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:05,408
entails information gain and that

473
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:08,224
therefore gives a motivation for why you

474
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:12,080
want to attend to the other term,

475
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,532
the information based learning

476
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:19,988
based term or knowledge refining a state

477
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:22,548
based term. But that's in the service of

478
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,952
the larger gain. And that's essentially

479
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,376
what a reinforcement learning tries

480
00:25:27,408 --> 00:25:29,176
to do is say look, we're going to look

481
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:32,376
ahead so that the moves we take now will

482
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,728
bring us advantage in the future and

483
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,568
there's a time discounting and all that.

484
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:40,484
So that takes away the idea

485
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,836
of information as being a value in and

486
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,460
of itself, but it's only for a purpose.

487
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,684
I'll raise that specifically with regard

488
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:52,744
to the team. A's example in a different

489
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,410
question. Yeah,

490
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,690
thank you. The balance between

491
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,544
Pragmatic and Epistemic is the

492
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:07,190
optimization. So that is the question

493
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,820
and that is the critical point and

494
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,932
that's the situational balance that

495
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:16,230
modeling is going to be evolving around

496
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,876
it's like some situationally optimal

497
00:26:21,908 --> 00:26:25,688
or preferable strategy around.

498
00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:29,450
That is the point.

499
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,436
But pointing to the point is not the

500
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,696
resolution. Does active inference

501
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:40,060
provide us a natural language grounded

502
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,970
first principles approach? It may,

503
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,404
but that is also not dilemma

504
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:54,992
resolution. So onto some questions,

505
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,430
but these are really great points.

506
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,196
Okay, this is just an

507
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:05,012
example of a type of question that I

508
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,424
encourage people, especially if they're

509
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:09,156
going back to the earlier chapters or

510
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:10,856
just whenever they feel like making a

511
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,936
contribution of this kind. These are

512
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,856
like super helpful questions. Again,

513
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,816
the questions we write, some of them may

514
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,368
be included in really important

515
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,628
educational materials, not the least of

516
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:24,364
which many further textbook groups, but

517
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:27,740
potentially even far beyond that. So

518
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,172
what would you ask somebody to

519
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:33,468
understand their comprehension of the

520
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:37,008
materials? So I understand what are the

521
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:39,728
rows, columns and numbers in these

522
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:43,616
equations? And it even

523
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:45,408
says it in the text. It's the

524
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,668
probability of the next state. So the

525
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:50,276
next state is in the rows, and then the

526
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:53,124
current state is in the columns. And

527
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:55,876
this gets distributed across everything

528
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:59,530
so that the rows and columns sum to one

529
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,716
as any other transition probability

530
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:07,450
matrix would be expected to have.

531
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,364
So we don't need to discuss it unless

532
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:12,876
somebody wants to go into a little more

533
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:15,676
detail. But this is going to be at the

534
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:18,952
core of that third step of the recipe,

535
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:21,464
which is you might have the structural

536
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:24,156
form from the second step of the recipe

537
00:28:24,188 --> 00:28:27,584
in chapter six. And then the next

538
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,512
step is to kind of specify or

539
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:35,570
instantiate, like in code,

540
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,830
what the dimensions are of

541
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,884
these matrices. This is just saying like

542
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,928
they are matrices. There's some prior

543
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,856
tensor matrix, some hidden state,

544
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,164
some transition matrix, some emission

545
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:53,028
matrix. And this is like the structure

546
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:56,536
step two of the recipe. Step three, how

547
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,116
many rows and columns. And as Yaakov

548
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,696
and others have been exploring, there's

549
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:04,920
the rows and columns of the analytical

550
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,260
representation with the equations.

551
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,964
And then there's how Pi MDP does

552
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,432
it, and there's how different

553
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,010
computational realizations do it.

554
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,264
Jacob, would you want to add anything

555
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:21,104
about the dimensionality of these

556
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,010
matrices? It could be interesting.

557
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,810
Yeah,

558
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,160
I can probably speak more to how Pyme DB

559
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,900
deals with the dimensionality, which

560
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,764
currently is probably adds

561
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,890
unnecessary redundancy to them.

562
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,332
Like if you're dealing with more complex

563
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:47,512
state space or rather more high

564
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,736
dimensional state space, and you have

565
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,116
different modalities that you want to

566
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:56,124
encode in these matrices because

567
00:29:56,322 --> 00:30:00,264
you're then performing

568
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:02,604
matrix multiplications, you need to keep

569
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:06,256
the dimensions of the matrices in

570
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:08,944
those given modalities equal, at least

571
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:12,796
in time DP not in other methods

572
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:16,276
as far as I'm aware. But that means that

573
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:18,212
then you have dimensions within these

574
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,684
matrices that don't contain any

575
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:24,596
information. So say you have a

576
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:28,664
grid that you represent for the

577
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:31,690
likelihood mapping of observation and

578
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,376
state in physical world, but then you

579
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,368
have another type of observation,

580
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:43,484
like where is another agent located with

581
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:46,492
respect to you? Are they in a certain

582
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:48,184
direction? And that might be represented

583
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:51,720
by five observations,

584
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,012
say, like they're above, they're below,

585
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,600
they're to the right, to the left, or

586
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,944
not at all. Then you would

587
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,728
need to encode the observation in the

588
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,496
nine by nine matrix, but then you need

589
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:07,924
to replicate it five times because that

590
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:10,160
is the same for each of those relative

591
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,124
observations. But then when you want to

592
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,084
encode the likelihood mapping just for

593
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:19,580
the second type of observation. I'm

594
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,344
actually not entirely sure what that

595
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,928
would be, but I'm presuming it's going

596
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:26,632
to be like five by five, but then

597
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,616
replicated. Nine times or something like

598
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,152
that, just so the dimensionality

599
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:33,644
matches. Because then you're doing

600
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:37,980
inference over both modalities and

601
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,332
at least in prime DP, you're then

602
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:44,536
performing matrix multiplications

603
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:47,804
over both of them. Thank you.

604
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:51,184
Jakub. One way I'm kind of like

605
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:55,404
seeing that is there's the sparsity of

606
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,596
the graph. But then,

607
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:02,560
in Pym DP or in any given computational

608
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,960
implementation, the data structures,

609
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,480
including potentially, like, auxiliary

610
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,696
data constructs, may have a

611
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:15,640
dimensionality that reflects

612
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,860
potentially, at worst, a combination

613
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,860
of the dimensionality of other aspects

614
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,316
as part of even just a Temp file that

615
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,844
you didn't even exactly specify. There

616
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,596
might be some intermediates, stated or

617
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,644
unstated intermediates whose

618
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:37,644
dimensionality isn't merely

619
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,868
the dimensionality of the analytical

620
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:43,056
representation. It's a little bit

621
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:46,660
of a subtle implementational point. But

622
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,020
this is the mountain to climb, to

623
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,340
implement these kinds of models.

624
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,844
And also, just while we're on this

625
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:58,596
topic, I think it's one area where CAD

626
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:01,464
CAD is going to be very interesting to

627
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:04,100
explore in active block for its package,

628
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,224
because we also can imagine that the

629
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:09,604
execution order of certain operations,

630
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:12,076
even in a single agent setting, not just

631
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:14,172
the multi agent setting, is really

632
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,910
relevant. So there's that question.

633
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,276
All right, so figure 7.2. All right. So

634
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,660
the first example is about a musician

635
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,930
playing music.

636
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,592
We are not aware of this example being

637
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:33,868
used anywhere else. Like the citations

638
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:36,592
following those. This musical note type

639
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:39,380
representation is not shown. And

640
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,236
previously we kind of discussed how some

641
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:43,216
of these trace black and white images

642
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:47,520
are really ambiguous because

643
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,436
of being like, intersecting black lines.

644
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:51,450
And then, of course,

645
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,248
the empty square. Yes.

646
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:00,388
Can you say where those black lines come

647
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,236
from? You want to dive into that right

648
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:05,630
now? Yeah. Well,

649
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,456
okay. The upper

650
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:12,268
left, each black line, even though it

651
00:34:12,274 --> 00:34:14,128
can be hard to trace them, I think

652
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:15,024
they're just being shown like

653
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:19,676
representationally. They're beliefs

654
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,336
about each note in the sequence at each

655
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:23,936
time step. So the time steps are on the

656
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:28,790
x axis and the

657
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,796
belief in terms of a probability are on

658
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,436
the y axis. So initially right. So

659
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,972
there's some there's some sort of and

660
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:40,952
this gets to another question that was

661
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:42,984
raised, but maybe this is time to talk

662
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:45,128
about it. There's some sort of engine,

663
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:47,720
some sort of differential equation

664
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,624
simulator or something running

665
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:52,332
underneath here right. That is not

666
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:53,944
discussed in the chapter, but that's

667
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:57,150
generating these belief curves. Yes.

668
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,708
It's related to some functions in

669
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:01,884
MATLAB. And I was just going to mention

670
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:04,716
that because my sense from the discrete

671
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:08,128
model would be you'd have five,

672
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:11,936
let's say, points on time zero, then

673
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:14,210
you'd have five points on time one.

674
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,820
So I thought, well, what is happening

675
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,664
with this kind of like little fractal

676
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:22,324
crash right here? How could you have a

677
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:26,000
continuously differentiable oscillating

678
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,304
type behavior when all

679
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:31,432
you're calculating analytically is just

680
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:34,952
12345? Then I

681
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:37,912
thought, is it meaning is, is the, are

682
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,360
the points actually at the midpoint?

683
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,432
And there's a differential equation

684
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:47,016
that's sort of like ribboning an action

685
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,452
perception loop through a discrete time

686
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:53,632
matrix. But then if

687
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:56,992
this is a function that's evaluatable at

688
00:35:57,046 --> 00:36:00,892
every point, aren't we in a continuous

689
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:04,848
time setting? So wouldn't that

690
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:08,564
have to imply like a machinery for

691
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:10,656
unpacking a continuous time action

692
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:14,310
perception cycle from discrete time

693
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,650
specification? So I agree

694
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,370
very much. Yeah.

695
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,816
Good. My guess is what they do is

696
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:29,160
they've got the equations,

697
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,036
the free energy equations and the

698
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,016
parameters are these distributions.

699
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:36,364
Okay, what's your belief in these

700
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,124
different properties? And those

701
00:36:40,162 --> 00:36:42,188
parameters evolve over time through a

702
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:45,056
differential equation because you turn

703
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,124
these things into a differential

704
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:49,088
equation and when you change state

705
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,496
something like, okay, now we've got

706
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:52,780
another note comes in, then that's

707
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,856
what's going to trigger the differential

708
00:36:55,888 --> 00:36:57,984
equation to go in a different direction,

709
00:36:58,032 --> 00:36:59,636
essentially. And that's why you've got

710
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:07,056
the five discrete kind of regimes

711
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:11,300
here or target points

712
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,270
that it kind of evolves to.

713
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,496
And then the next note comes in and now

714
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:19,672
the boundary conditions change,

715
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:21,224
essentially. So your differential

716
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,444
equation takes you in a different

717
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:25,576
direction. I recall that there's

718
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,796
something like you guys probably

719
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:30,764
discussed this more than I paid

720
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:32,856
attention, but there's some sort of

721
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:34,544
universal solver that they are

722
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:39,648
providing. So you just plug in your

723
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:43,680
matrices, your state equations,

724
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,752
your transition matrices, and then it'll

725
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:50,436
solve it all for you. And that may be

726
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,464
what this differential equation solver

727
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,532
is about. Do you think that sounds

728
00:37:54,586 --> 00:38:00,804
right? Yes, I think whenever,

729
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:02,776
variously in the method sections and

730
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:04,836
supplemental sections of paper, they'll

731
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:08,004
say in the paper, we're only specifying

732
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,068
the generative model and the matrices

733
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:13,244
and then we use standard routines to

734
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:15,340
address it. Now, I don't think that has

735
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,692
the, it's not the pinnacle of

736
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:20,056
accessibility and reproducibility.

737
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,332
However, it does at least use standard

738
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:23,696
routines. But again, those are not

739
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,368
always specified in the paper, which is

740
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:29,632
an issue. So it'll be important to

741
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:34,624
regenerate examples within SPM and

742
00:38:34,662 --> 00:38:37,156
then also to use some of these things

743
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:39,504
that we were discussing with the ability

744
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:41,220
to move between different languages,

745
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,296
but like VBX variational,

746
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,236
bayes X, I don't know what the X is

747
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,150
actually for.

748
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,468
It's one of the core functions.

749
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,596
It is actually doing the variational

750
00:38:56,628 --> 00:39:00,072
inference in SPM. And again,

751
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:02,280
SPM is like this sort of like chimera

752
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,956
package because it arose from the

753
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,652
immediacies of needing to do

754
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,352
neuroimaging registration and dynamical

755
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:13,356
analysis that then broached into dynamic

756
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:16,684
causal modeling, random field theory

757
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,420
based statistical testing, permutation

758
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,370
testing all these areas that are not

759
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,212
themselves formally linked per se, but

760
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,996
rather useful as part of the toolkit of

761
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:30,820
a Neuroimaging researcher.

762
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,716
Then, just as we were a little bit

763
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:38,328
discussing like chapter two, and of

764
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,752
course, many times earlier in that

765
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:43,764
generalized Bayesian inferential

766
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:46,436
framework, hierarchical modeling,

767
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:50,716
including action, is actually not the

768
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,990
hardest thing. Yes,

769
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,950
implementing action is one thing, but

770
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,672
treating action selection as inference,

771
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:02,430
planning as inference, it has some

772
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,664
challenges that arise relative to just

773
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,840
doing time series anticipation,

774
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,284
but then those functions became compiled

775
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:17,760
into SPM in a limited capacity.

776
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,012
So again, they go through some of this.

777
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:26,288
But I think it's a key issue. We'll

778
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,632
definitely look forward to what the free

779
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,090
energy gradients are,

780
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,064
but where the

781
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:39,608
continuous nature of these curves and

782
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:41,196
why? There are the numbers that there

783
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:45,500
are 1234-5678,

784
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,340
910. Now there's five notes.

785
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,910
Ten is two times five.

786
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,848
There's a little bit more that needs to

787
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,770
be fleshed out there.

788
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,864
And then one question that was like,

789
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:06,724
again, somewhere between testing our

790
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:09,764
comprehension and being clear about what

791
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:13,888
we're doing here, and in this ambiguity,

792
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,820
we can ask it without any bias,

793
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,592
the negative free energy gradients. I e

794
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:26,264
prediction errors. What is

795
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:28,056
a prediction error? A free energy

796
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:31,684
calculation. Well, ignore gradient

797
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,024
for a second. Free energy calculations

798
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:35,656
are not prediction errors. Prediction

799
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:37,512
errors are observations minus

800
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:39,884
expectations. So this is like some

801
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:42,236
finite value in the state space of what

802
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:45,592
is being measured. Free energy is not

803
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:48,064
that it references potentially those

804
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:49,488
variables, but it does things that we

805
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:51,056
know about, like KL divergences and

806
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:53,504
such. Okay, so free energy is not

807
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,524
prediction error. And that's a huge

808
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:58,150
difference between, for example, a

809
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,076
predictive processing framework and

810
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:06,224
a free energy hierarchical predictive

811
00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:09,296
architecture. Eric but they're

812
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:11,256
saying the gradient and free energy is a

813
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,616
prediction error. Exactly. So even if it

814
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:16,504
were that's, then that was the next

815
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,088
question, which was, what's the

816
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,496
difference between free energy and the

817
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:21,852
free energy gradients? Are we talking

818
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,708
about a landscape of

819
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:28,220
derivatives, of free energy energies,

820
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,150
or are we talking about what here?

821
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,296
Is it being described as a gradient, as

822
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:40,780
a landscape? And hence gradient ish

823
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,930
because it can be calculated over some

824
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,430
discrete, bi continuous state space.

825
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,484
It's like five skyscrapers that you

826
00:42:52,522 --> 00:42:55,716
could have derivatives over in the

827
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:57,108
Y direction, but you couldn't take the

828
00:42:57,114 --> 00:43:00,552
partial x. Or is it

829
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:04,168
truly or is it a

830
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:06,392
continuous landscape that just being

831
00:43:06,446 --> 00:43:09,064
tethered to the discrete values in x?

832
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:10,324
But then again, that's that whole

833
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,684
continuous, discrete question. Or are

834
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:15,260
the values gradients,

835
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,472
which has an even more complex

836
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:22,488
interpretation. So we don't

837
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:27,516
have the answers on these, but it's

838
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:29,804
hard to understand how these figures

839
00:43:29,852 --> 00:43:32,304
could have epistemic or pragmatic value

840
00:43:32,502 --> 00:43:36,388
for learners or practitioners without

841
00:43:36,474 --> 00:43:39,780
some of these questions being resolved.

842
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,380
All right, the first example,

843
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,116
this is just kind of from walking

844
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:52,808
through. So the first example was just

845
00:43:52,894 --> 00:43:55,240
hidden Markov model hidden states

846
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,652
updating through time, Bayesian filter

847
00:43:57,716 --> 00:43:59,352
column and filter. This is like just

848
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,328
standard signal processing in a Bayesian

849
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:04,376
framework. And we're.

850
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,916
Going to see a lot of echoes of the step

851
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:09,036
by step model stream one, they give an

852
00:44:09,058 --> 00:44:11,064
even simpler example with static

853
00:44:11,112 --> 00:44:14,370
perception, one step perception and then

854
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,650
go second to the dynamic case,

855
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,288
then introduce action pi policy and then

856
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:24,364
nuance policy through like uncertainty

857
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,764
and so on. So that's the first

858
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:31,076
inferential case they're then going to

859
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:32,896
head into decision making and planning

860
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:38,104
as inference. So we

861
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,728
see policy being introduced as a

862
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:44,712
variable that influences how

863
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,250
states change through time.

864
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,116
Does policy do that or does action do

865
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:54,940
that? In the one step limit,

866
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,180
policies are actions are affordances,

867
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,756
but Pi is specifically reserved for

868
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:03,324
sequences of actions. So is it that

869
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:07,744
sequences of actions like do that or is

870
00:45:07,782 --> 00:45:10,240
this the actual base topology?

871
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,716
But nonetheless, that architecture

872
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:18,336
allows the evaluation of alternate

873
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,400
policies in terms of their relative

874
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,204
expect variational or expected free

875
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,044
energy, depending on whether a one step

876
00:45:25,082 --> 00:45:26,884
policy is accomplishable with

877
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:28,984
variational free energy that's, like the

878
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:31,370
instantaneous move,

879
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,680
most consistent instantaneous maneuver

880
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,984
versus even one step in advance is going

881
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:41,164
to broach into this whole expected free

882
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:45,100
energy space we had

883
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,016
on 130. So there's

884
00:45:49,048 --> 00:45:52,300
a really important discussion.

885
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,008
Bozaki is also very interesting

886
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:57,410
researcher neural rhythms and so on.

887
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,608
Factorization is a really important

888
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:06,192
topic and being able to distinguish like

889
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:07,948
neurologically what do we mean when we

890
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,300
talk about the what and the where

891
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,312
stream, the dorsal and the ventral

892
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,216
stream and critiques of it, et cetera.

893
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:17,204
But just what and where in the brain and

894
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:20,072
then in the factor graphs and

895
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:24,164
computationally because the unfactorized

896
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:26,776
models, if we're just doing the all by

897
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:29,352
all by all by all, those become

898
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,124
intractable very fast. And the

899
00:46:32,162 --> 00:46:34,716
specification of the sparsity of the

900
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:37,516
model is one and the same in the

901
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,196
variational base framework as the

902
00:46:39,218 --> 00:46:42,744
factorization of the model. So

903
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,956
factorization is like kind of focusing

904
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:48,016
your search efforts on manifolds where

905
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,576
you've constrained certain things to be

906
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:53,360
like linked or unlinked.

907
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,576
That is what motivates the structure

908
00:46:56,608 --> 00:47:00,740
learning problem and the need

909
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,084
to have to

910
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:07,540
not be locked into factorization schemes

911
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,680
at a given level of analysis.

912
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,410
Okay, another just

913
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,580
question to explore.

914
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,140
Like here we have the top

915
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,636
half of figure 43. There's just one A

916
00:47:28,658 --> 00:47:29,500
matrix.

917
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,210
So why are there two A matrices here?

918
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,344
Well, it's not an impossible question

919
00:47:37,462 --> 00:47:41,010
and the symbols go a long way.

920
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,680
Here's the four locations that the

921
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,230
animal can be in starting position,

922
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,420
bottom position, left arm or right arm.

923
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,350
Then here are the

924
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,212
it's five on the X here because

925
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:03,864
that bottom could, could reveal an

926
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:06,984
R or reveal an L. In this case it

927
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:10,508
reveals an R and the

928
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,404
food is honestly there. And then this is

929
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:17,310
a second a matrix that is

930
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,272
describing how location is associated

931
00:48:21,336 --> 00:48:25,356
with the food. None aversive

932
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:28,448
or positive. But this ties into the

933
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:30,912
earlier discussion. Like it might be all

934
00:48:30,966 --> 00:48:33,040
one thing to say well it's four x five

935
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,852
and then four by three. But is this

936
00:48:36,906 --> 00:48:39,590
actually a four x five by three.

937
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,356
I know it's not. Eric, what do you

938
00:48:46,378 --> 00:48:48,948
think? Yeah, and they'd mentioned in

939
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:50,730
there it's a tensor also.

940
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,196
And the tensor means that you're

941
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:56,730
stacking this one,

942
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,148
this image against the version where the

943
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,316
reward is on the left side. So the

944
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:08,076
tensor is going to be four x eight

945
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,324
by two. So that makes sense for being

946
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:13,392
the tensor. So the state is another

947
00:49:13,446 --> 00:49:15,168
layer on top of this. The hidden state

948
00:49:15,254 --> 00:49:17,090
is another layer on top of that.

949
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,930
Yes,

950
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:32,836
section 73. So this would be a fun kind

951
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:35,190
of like PH d. Qualifying level.

952
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,012
Question just describe the whole team

953
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:42,792
ace every row, every column and every

954
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,450
value. Why is it that way?

955
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,222
So we're not going to type it out here,

956
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:55,020
but to understand that example

957
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,340
and what the B matrices are, and just

958
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,462
to have agility

959
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:05,046
and just identifying the differences

960
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:06,934
between these matrices numerically,

961
00:50:07,062 --> 00:50:08,666
like pattern recognition, like, oh,

962
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:10,426
here there's two ones, here two zeros.

963
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:12,734
Here two zeros, here two ones, here one

964
00:50:12,772 --> 00:50:15,454
and zero. These stay the same. And then

965
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:17,274
to be able to transpose that in your

966
00:50:17,332 --> 00:50:20,306
understanding to what this means in

967
00:50:20,328 --> 00:50:22,210
terms of transition frequencies,

968
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,740
every place where there's a difference,

969
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,898
it's a difference that makes a

970
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:31,590
difference. So being able to understand

971
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,594
what those are is about understanding

972
00:50:34,642 --> 00:50:37,602
this example. And one can imagine,

973
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,958
especially if they're wanting to make an

974
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,586
application of active inference that's

975
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,900
more complex than this, four x four,

976
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,370
being fluent with how

977
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,994
these matrices are constructed, their

978
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:55,454
dimensionality, how differences in the

979
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:57,914
generative process are incorporated,

980
00:50:58,042 --> 00:50:59,662
how differences in the generative model

981
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:01,854
are incorporated, all these different

982
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,320
features are important.

983
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,274
Yes, Eric, this is definitely very

984
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:13,326
important. Question agreed.

985
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,214
Like it, it looks extremely

986
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:21,266
neural, and these traces

987
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,680
come up all the time.

988
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,786
Similarly, here we have three discrete

989
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:32,778
time points starting going to

990
00:51:32,784 --> 00:51:35,946
the Q, getting the L, and then going to

991
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,658
the left arm. But then what is

992
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:43,660
this? Step one and a half is the one,

993
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:48,960
all of these points. And then by two,

994
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,658
the uncertainty is resolved. The belief

995
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:53,198
about certain things goes to zero, the

996
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:55,054
belief about other things goes to one.

997
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:57,418
And this is just a pure interpolation.

998
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,398
But that is quite a specific

999
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,486
interpolation, including what appear to

1000
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:05,826
be some like dopaminergic spikes or

1001
00:52:05,848 --> 00:52:08,354
something that are not reflected at

1002
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:11,106
either of the time points. My guess is

1003
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,538
that you've got three different blocks

1004
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:14,774
there. So if you take the one as being

1005
00:52:14,812 --> 00:52:18,200
the width, one third of the way across

1006
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,406
the two is another third and the three

1007
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,066
is another third, then that switch there

1008
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,666
that you see happens as soon as you

1009
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:26,540
transition from the one to the two.

1010
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,824
Yes, although still

1011
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:35,708
there's even the graphical interpolation

1012
00:52:35,724 --> 00:52:39,830
interpolation. Question and

1013
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,988
it's so easy to be like reading is it

1014
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,870
just a quirk of the dashed line?

1015
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,916
But are there two dashed lines?

1016
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:54,488
And two dashed lines diverged in a

1017
00:52:54,494 --> 00:52:58,996
neural trace? But it's

1018
00:52:59,028 --> 00:53:00,628
kind of clear. These ones, the discrete

1019
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,120
formulations are clearer.

1020
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,856
Yeah. Okay. Are rats prone

1021
00:53:06,888 --> 00:53:09,310
to useless behavior? What do you think?

1022
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,420
What useless behavior?

1023
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,096
I wrote it out. Okay, this is good time

1024
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:19,984
for today, but that's my most

1025
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:22,368
provocative comment on this one. And

1026
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:24,050
maybe we can save that for next week.

1027
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,336
Okay, perfect. Let's pick up with this

1028
00:53:26,358 --> 00:53:29,430
one and any other questions.

1029
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,184
Then we'll glance over the visual

1030
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:35,990
cicade. Look at the learning example.

1031
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,140
Consider the hierarchical example.

1032
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,028
There's the maze. Then there's the

1033
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:45,072
hierarchical example. Another nested.

1034
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:48,580
Discrete meets neural continuous trace.

1035
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,750
And then we end on Stefan's squared. So

1036
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,270
thank you all. Have an excellent day.
