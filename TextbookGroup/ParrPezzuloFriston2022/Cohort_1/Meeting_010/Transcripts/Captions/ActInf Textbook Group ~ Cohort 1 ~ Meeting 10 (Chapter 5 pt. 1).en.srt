00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,839
hello

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,839
it is july 7th 2022

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,840
it is cohort one textbook group week 10

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,320
chapter five

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,040
so we're having the first discussion of

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,199
chapter five we'll have two weeks of

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,119
discussing chapter five

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,080
then

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,600
in our last two weeks of july

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,119
talk about

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,320
more general thoughts that we have on

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,279
chapters one through five and

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,840
look forward to the

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,040
second half of the book

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,850
um

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,559
[Music]

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
here there's two new

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
columns

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,760
this first one is if you'd like to

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,719
join for chapters one through five

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
cohort two beginning in

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
september 22

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
and that will be in parallel with also

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
this first cohort continuing for

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
chapters six through ten so just put a

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,640
check mark

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,799
if you want to stay in otherwise we

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,960
won't like include you in that cohort

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,159
okay

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,000
so

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,330
um

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,680
[Music]

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
there's only a few questions prepared

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
for chapter five

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
so let's start with any general

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,439
thoughts

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
that people had about chapter five like

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
how is this chapter similar or different

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,799
from the previous ones

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
and what is the function of chapter five

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
here

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
or what what did they think was an

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,560
important overall aspect of this chapter

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
and then of course anyone who can

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
capture questions that people are asking

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
here just add them

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
but other than that it would be awesome

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
to hear like

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
what did people think chapter five was

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
doing or what did they wonder about

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,320
about the material or related to it

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,640
ali and then anyone else

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
uh i think chapter five uh

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
needs a lot of neurobiological

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
background and without

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
uh necessary requisites uh it

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
can be probably daunting chapter

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,879
and unlike other chapters which are at

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
least the previous chapters

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
uh which concern themselves with

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,680
mathematical formalisms uh here in

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
chapter 5 for the very first time

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
we encounter some empirical evidence for

64
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,680
uh

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,400
or

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
the empirical uh

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,480
reasons behind

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,319
uh modeling active inference

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,480
as such so

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
it's a very important chapter in my

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,120
opinion but at the same time without any

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,319
prior neurobiological background uh it

73
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,959
could be a really daunting chapter as

74
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
well

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,560
nice

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
thanks for the summary uh mike

77
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,840
yeah it was an interesting choice to go

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
all the way to the human brain to

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
illustrate how these concepts would map

80
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,440
to biological systems

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,879
as opposed to

82
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,040
starting with more simplistic organisms

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,000
and kind of working up from there

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,959
yeah very nice point

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,159
any other overview thoughts and then we

86
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
can just like scan through it and look

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
at the order of a few things and then

88
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,879
continue to write questions

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,959
again like as you're hearing them or

90
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,279
like as you're just wondering

91
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,000
but let's um

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,520
yeah hear any other general thoughts if

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
anyone wants to raise their hand and

94
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
then look at the order

95
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,719
of the chapter

96
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
okay

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
well the chapter is titled message

98
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
passing in neurobiology

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
message passing was brought up

100
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,520
in

101
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
a previous

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
chapter

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
in this box 4.1 in a

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,359
formal

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,880
yet slightly non-standard

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,520
notation without examples just generally

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,919
the quote

108
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,039
anyone have any thoughts on

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
jeff

110
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
yes i kind of disagree with the quote

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,039
i i think uh recently we've we've

112
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,759
learned that the plants actually uh

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,039
sense and act on their their their uh on

114
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
what they they detect in the environment

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
for example

116
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
uh certain trees when they're being

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
munched on by um

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
say like giraffes

119
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
will emit uh

120
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,039
molecules that will disperse and other

121
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,680
trees that would that

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
sense these uh this essentially an alert

123
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
signal will start producing uh compounds

124
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
in the leaves that make the leaves taste

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
very bitter and thus discouraging uh

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,700
foraging

127
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,199
[Music]

128
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
and so forth and so on and also we you

129
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,919
know

130
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
i think it's clear that plants sense and

131
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,199
act

132
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
and respond to their environment and act

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,319
in order to maintain their integrity or

134
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
as individuals or as uh as groups

135
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
in the example i just

136
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,319
mentioned

137
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
nice agreed

138
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
oh also the quote might have like a

139
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,800
little bit of hyperbole slash

140
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,479
comedy like two types of animals

141
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,000
plants

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
so

143
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,039
it's about

144
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,840
nervous systems ali

145
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
uh yeah and uh one other thing about

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
rodolfo linus is um in one of his most

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
famous books eye of the cortex from

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
neurons to self

149
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,039
um actually he describes thinking

150
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,479
uh as an internalized movement uh and

151
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,280
it's a very interesting way to describe

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
uh thinking in my opinion and uh it

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
directly relates to this active

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,840
inference uh framework so

155
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
uh

156
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
yeah putting uh his quotation here might

157
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,800
be quite relevant

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
cool and then i added a 2017 paper with

159
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,479
fristen

160
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
and calvo about plant and predictive

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
processing framework

162
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
and then here's a like a non-active

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,720
paper but about more on the behavioral

164
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,919
side

165
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,280
which is kind of the view from the

166
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
outside

167
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,360
without denying the view from the inside

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
as well

169
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
but

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
it's just related to behavioral modeling

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
okay in the

172
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,800
uh introduction

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
they write let us take a step back from

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
the technical material of chapter four

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
which as um

176
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
ali and others have reminded us was like

177
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
even at the beginning was like you can

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
bypass this chapter if you don't want

179
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,479
technical detail

180
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,599
so

181
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
maybe somebody had read it even one two

182
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
three

183
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,599
five

184
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,440
and maybe they didn't look at the

185
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
appendix

186
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,760
turn to the process theory's

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
accompanying active inference

188
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,640
drawing a distinction between a

189
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
principle

190
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,040
and a process theory

191
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,720
does anyone have any thoughts on that

192
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
like how as they're reading the book are

193
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
they thinking about

194
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
where free energy principle is related

195
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,640
to active inference

196
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,440
how does introducing that

197
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
kind of broad

198
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,320
map territory slash

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
principle process

200
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,600
distinction here help transition the

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
book towards focusing on these empirical

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,839
cases

203
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,439
ali with a hand raise or anyone else

204
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
okay just one

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,240
yeah yeah go for it

206
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,040
yeah

207
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
sorry just one thing i forgot to mention

208
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,680
about that quotation

209
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
is uh

210
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
as an interesting research has been

211
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
emerging uh that's

212
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
uh kind of

213
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,279
um

214
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
so consciousness to plants as well uh

215
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,279
one of

216
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,839
the

217
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,800
articles uh

218
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
one of the early articles for that is

219
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,920
insights into plant consciousness uh so

220
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
uh in fact

221
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
we don't necessarily uh

222
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,720
limit it to

223
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,519
just human or even animal consciousness

224
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
and we're beginning to relate

225
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
consciousness or

226
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
any other aspects of nervous system to

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
plants as well so just one additional

228
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,160
remarks about that previous code sorry

229
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,959
cool

230
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,880
yeah and the mathematical like framework

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
for behavior and consciousness that

232
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
are integrative

233
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,959
will allow comparisons of different

234
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,720
kinds of behavioral systems and that

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
like leads to people wondering about

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
consciousness and all those other areas

237
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
um

238
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,240
so

239
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
mike and then anyone else

240
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
yeah so i'm tying that back to

241
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
the part of the chapter that you're on

242
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
previously in terms of moving from

243
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,640
principle to process

244
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,440
and and you had highlighted that

245
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
the latter allows us to develop

246
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,440
hypotheses that are answerable to

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,959
empirical data

248
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,000
so i think this is um

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
the the first part of

250
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
the first instance in the book where

251
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,279
they are

252
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,160
um

253
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,360
making

254
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,079
a serious effort to tie out to real

255
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,800
world observations as opposed to saying

256
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
here's a a framework for how things

257
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
might work and how the pieces might be

258
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
connected now we're going to take that

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
framework and think about uh

260
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,640
can we

261
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,920
identify

262
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
things that we see in real systems in

263
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
this case in the human brain

264
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
and tie those back into the ideas that

265
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,839
we put forth previously

266
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,839
thanks totally agree it's like

267
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
partitioning off

268
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,399
the principles from the earlier chapters

269
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,800
like in principle those two sides of the

270
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,839
equation are equal because of how

271
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,399
the axioms of math are or like in

272
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,480
principle one could do this with a

273
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
bayesian graph

274
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
and then that is like it's like in

275
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,279
principle you could do a linear

276
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,560
regression with a least squares error

277
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
minimization nobody can make any data

278
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
set that says that you can't do that

279
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
and then there's how that least squares

280
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
regression works

281
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,959
on the empirical data

282
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,880
so they're saying for chapter five we're

283
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
going to

284
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,000
look at

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
with all the architecture developed

286
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
a few specific neural systems

287
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,680
and talk about how they're

288
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,800
the best

289
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
current

290
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,959
uh understanding that they have of how

291
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,880
these neural systems can be

292
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,519
modeled with the models of the uh

293
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,680
structures like we've seen before

294
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,279
and they're

295
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
saying we're not trying to write a neuro

296
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
textbook here

297
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,720
but to touch

298
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
kind of like with both feet the

299
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
empirical modeling

300
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
and then the systems that they are going

301
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
to

302
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
model

303
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
are like

304
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,440
effector systems so motor control

305
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,519
subcortical structures like the thalamus

306
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
and basal ganglia

307
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
the which are so these are more like um

308
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,920
functional outcomes of the nervous

309
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
system

310
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
specific anatomical structures of

311
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
interest

312
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
modulation of synaptic efficiency or

313
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
efficacy

314
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,360
which is like a micro anatomical or like

315
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,519
a neurophysiological

316
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
mechanism of interest

317
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
if and something that is an important

318
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
like leverage point and something that

319
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,160
is being modified and found to be

320
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
changed in different situations

321
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,360
and then

322
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,160
um

323
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,839
the relationship between decision making

324
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
and movement generation

325
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
which is also something that has come up

326
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
in those um 46 live streams

327
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,160
on like motor active inference decision

328
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,719
making active inference

329
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,399
so what did

330
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
uh well let's check if there's any

331
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
questions written

332
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,760
okay

333
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,880
um what could anyone say about

334
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
the cortical layers

335
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,279
or what was in figure 5.1

336
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,120
mike so

337
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
i was just observing that

338
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,160
um

339
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,040
in

340
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
in the start of chapter four they said

341
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,079
well you can skip this chapter if you

342
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,839
don't want to get deep into the math and

343
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
then here we are at section 5 2 in

344
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,160
chapter 5 i think and they refer back to

345
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,440
the message past passing

346
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,199
structure that was set up in chapter

347
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,439
four

348
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
yes

349
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,440
good point

350
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,320
and it's like well if you can skip the

351
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
uh details of the formalism to look at

352
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,320
the examples or you could skip the

353
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
examples

354
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
any linear

355
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,440
text 140 characters or textbook or you

356
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
know live stream or anything it's always

357
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,560
going to be some sort of linear

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
presentation

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,519
question

360
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,240
and with a densely

361
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,839
linked

362
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,040
and interdisciplinary area then like the

363
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
linearity becomes challenging

364
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
so maybe with more

365
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,639
you know with some notebooks or some

366
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
other rendering or

367
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,600
educational way to

368
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
have the ordering or have the of course

369
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
the connections between sections be a

370
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,279
little bit different

371
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
um the first

372
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,440
system that they're focusing on is the

373
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
cortical column

374
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,240
does anyone have like any

375
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,519
thing to add on

376
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
cortical layers or the role of the

377
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,000
cortex

378
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,279
even if it's just something that they've

379
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,519
heard about

380
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
well i think that

381
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,399
this um

382
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,680
numenta line of ai

383
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
and um many of the other oh i'll lea go

384
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,880
for it yes

385
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,000
i just i want to say that

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
uh well

387
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
for the past

388
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,079
and couple of decades or probably

389
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
several decades uh cortex uh has

390
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,600
traditionally been thought of as the

391
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,279
seat of both consciousness intelligence

392
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
and also of course cognition but

393
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,320
recent studies has shown that especially

394
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
studies such as mark some

395
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,199
research has shown that in fact

396
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,280
consciousness actually stems from uh

397
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,199
literally the brain stem not uh

398
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,160
necessarily the cortex so uh there are

399
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
some challenges about the exact function

400
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
of cortex

401
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,559
and

402
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,240
the debate goes on

403
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
nice okay

404
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
here's a little bit on the cortex

405
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,039
so it is the outer frontal part of the

406
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,080
mammalian style brain

407
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
insects don't have

408
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
cortex

409
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,400
um

410
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
though they share a lot of the same

411
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
architectures and so on so this is like

412
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,000
neuron tracing

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
and there's kind of two levels of

414
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
organization that people are modeling in

415
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
the cortical models the first is like

416
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
based upon the

417
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,480
histological observation of the layers

418
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
these are six layers of like

419
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,679
cells and there's like a lot of

420
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,039
development and all

421
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,240
different functionality between the

422
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,679
different layers

423
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,080
um one important thing to note is like

424
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,919
it's not that they're like the layers of

425
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,840
a bayesian hierarchical model they're

426
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
not like it's not like each one is like

427
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,360
up and down up and down so this isn't

428
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
like a predictive processing

429
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
architecture happening

430
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
simply with these six layers this is not

431
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
a six layer model

432
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
in fact they're connected to each other

433
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
sparsely within a column as it's shown

434
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
here in 5.1

435
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
so that's like the micro anatomical

436
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,960
structure of the cortical column

437
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
and it's called a column because it's

438
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,880
like the layers are also arranged in

439
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
this repeating way

440
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,240
and there's just like

441
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,320
a lot of different um

442
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
layouts

443
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
for different

444
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,679
regions of this

445
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,480
cortical tissue type

446
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
and in certain situations it is

447
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,559
organized

448
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,520
like

449
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,400
linear corner structures

450
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
which is often seen as like one of the

451
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
evolutionary

452
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
local maxima

453
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,520
of like

454
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
depth of processing

455
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
and sparsity of connections laterally so

456
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
those are the two levels of analysis

457
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,919
that are being and as ally mentioned

458
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,280
like people yes i've gone to the

459
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,520
consciousness angle or they've just

460
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,799
argued that this is kind of like the

461
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,000
massively paralyzable but also like deep

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,240
recurrent

463
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
contextual

464
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,640
etc the anagrams like the patterns that

465
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
can be activated

466
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,760
the dimensionalities potentially super

467
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
high so it could play a role in memory

468
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
signal processing

469
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
and the two levels that people look at

470
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
the connections between

471
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,520
like anatomically by taking these images

472
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
or by um doing like stainings and stuff

473
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
um anatomically and functionally is

474
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
within the column where there's certain

475
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,400
kinds of relationships and then across

476
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,159
columns where there are certain kinds of

477
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,919
relationships

478
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,840
so

479
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,640
um

480
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,799
any thoughts or questions on that but

481
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,480
like that's just like why the cortex is

482
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,679
being studied and that's like a little

483
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,480
bit of how like the neuroscientists

484
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,159
have been approaching this

485
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,840
and why this is one of the important

486
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
systems with a lot of theoretical

487
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,919
modeling and empirical evidence and like

488
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,760
relevance as well

489
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
um jf

490
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,280
i remember many many years ago

491
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
taking a course in

492
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
physiology on the visual cortex

493
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
and you know the whole notion that the

494
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,640
brain

495
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
has some kind of structure

496
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,120
um always i thought was fascinating

497
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,440
because i i feel that

498
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
the brain is a huge hack

499
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,440
patches upon patches upon patches

500
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,919
brought by evolution and that

501
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
there would be some structure in it is

502
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
is

503
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,159
is uh

504
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,919
is interesting but within within those

505
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,640
structures there's as those this picture

506
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
shows this it's very messy i would never

507
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,559
implement a system with this kind of of

508
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,960
wild interconnectivity

509
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,360
so

510
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
i'm very

511
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
curious about

512
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,240
how much we can

513
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,360
infer

514
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,400
from

515
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
what is really a

516
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
mildly structured but highly messy

517
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,520
architecture in terms of the the process

518
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,280
theory that we're trying to uh to

519
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,799
elucidate

520
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
from anatomy and the functionality of

521
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,200
the brain

522
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,480
nice thank you mike

523
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,120
yeah that makes me think that some of

524
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
that messiness is

525
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,400
in support of redundancy and so

526
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,799
how do we think about redundancies in

527
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,200
systems in the context of active

528
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,679
inference

529
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,120
yeah and like neural systems of course

530
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
have amazing

531
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
in some dimensions ability to have

532
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,799
redundancy other times seemingly there's

533
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,000
points of failure jeff

534
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,159
okay okay all right so just

535
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,360
um on the left side i'm sorry oh

536
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
yeah sorry

537
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
uh on the comment about redundancy i

538
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
agree but it's worse than that it's it's

539
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
uh every part

540
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
often plays

541
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
many different roles and and participate

542
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
in different functions which makes it

543
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,720
quite a tangle

544
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,320
uh in terms of uh functional analysis of

545
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,640
parts of the brain what they do and what

546
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
not

547
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
so five one is showing

548
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,400
um a

549
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
more like pure

550
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,400
base graph

551
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,840
um

552
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,240
with the annotation of the kinds of

553
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,600
cells

554
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,559
that are in the anatomical layer so this

555
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,080
is like

556
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
a visualization of the anatomy based

557
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
upon the regions that it connects gets

558
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,159
inputs and outputs from

559
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,840
and then the micro

560
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,240
anatomy labeled according to cell types

561
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,760
then

562
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,880
with a similar but not exactly

563
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
concordant there's not a statistical

564
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
test proposed for how concordant theos

565
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
are it's not a statistical argument it's

566
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
not exclusive of other framings of what

567
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
this anatomy is doing

568
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,880
here are labeled with different

569
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,159
parameters

570
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,360
from

571
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
the base graph architectures that have

572
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,600
been explored in the previous chapters

573
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,840
compatible with message passing

574
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,159
implementations that other papers have

575
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
addressed that aren't here

576
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
these are like architectures that

577
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,400
recapitulate

578
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,679
some of the

579
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
functional

580
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,039
and macro structural and microstructural

581
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,400
aspects

582
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
so this is like computational

583
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
neuroscience

584
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
and it's using these models that

585
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,919
actually have an underlying structure

586
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,039
that is

587
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
providing utility

588
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,760
and

589
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,480
interesting reframings of the anatomy

590
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,679
and as the model

591
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,919
um statistical architecture begins to

592
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,039
recapitulate aspects of this of the

593
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,760
cyto architecture

594
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
there's like no specific threshold where

595
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,039
it's like oh well now it's like an

596
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
argument that it's you know doing that

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
function

598
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
like

599
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,919
people get tantalized by it having some

600
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,400
oh we made this network structured like

601
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
a brain or we made this network

602
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,840
structured like a mushroom or we did the

603
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,960
ant colony optimization

604
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,039
so just because like this works for what

605
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,240
it does doesn't mean this works

606
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,960
for what anyone wants it to do

607
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
it's just in this huge space of

608
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,799
bio-inspired model architectures

609
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
in um

610
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
five two they move a little bit from the

611
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,640
consideration of the columnar

612
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
architecture which are cell populations

613
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,799
to

614
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,120
um looking now like still the

615
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
superficial to deep are the six layers

616
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,440
of the cortex

617
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
but now a few of the variables are

618
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,559
highlighted and they're relationships

619
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,679
and so

620
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,520
the um

621
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
um

622
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,640
ascending and descending prediction

623
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
error in a predictive processing

624
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,919
framework which is like often

625
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,559
graphically seen going up and down

626
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,120
bottom up and top-down effects

627
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,080
here

628
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,919
is being shown in the context of the

629
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
columnar

630
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,440
cortex

631
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
where like errors

632
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
from one

633
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,480
like let's just

634
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
go to where they

635
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,279
um

636
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,400
the

637
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,200
e's are the errors

638
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,960
and the g's are predictions

639
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,440
and um

640
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
i guess we can find what mu is but

641
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,360
basically like this architecture within

642
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
and between

643
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
columns

644
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
could be like this being like

645
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,880
the base variable being estimated and a

646
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
hierarchical nested model of that and a

647
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
hierarchical model of that

648
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,640
so there's like a generalization

649
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
statistical architecture

650
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,679
that has compatibility with the neural

651
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,080
architecture of the brain

652
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,559
and it does like a pure statistical

653
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,840
function

654
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,679
and that pure statistical function has

655
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,360
like resemblance with some things that

656
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,039
the brain region is believed to do

657
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,640
so that

658
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
allows this statistical model to be

659
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,799
explaining and pre predicting

660
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,080
and useful

661
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
about the brain which is like what

662
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,039
computational neuroscience does

663
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,120
so that was the first

664
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
one of the systems that they focus on

665
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,559
then

666
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,760
oh yeah i guess this was

667
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
um then the factor systems okay let's

668
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,559
see if we can kind of quickly look at

669
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,840
all the systems

670
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
what

671
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
did anyone see or what would they like

672
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,919
to say about figure five three

673
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,919
neuroanatomy associated with active

674
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,919
inference in modulating spinal motor

675
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,919
reflexes

676
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,799
um

677
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,720
okay

678
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
so five one was the columnar

679
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
architecture

680
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,440
and that was described in terms of what

681
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
cell types were in it

682
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,399
here they're going to pick up on one of

683
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,080
those cell types

684
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,480
which is like the computational role

685
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,120
the expectations encoded

686
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,200
by this cell type that's found in this

687
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
layer

688
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,360
of the

689
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,279
motor cortex

690
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,039
and so different regions of the cortex

691
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,399
have different

692
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,439
apparent functions

693
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,840
asterisk asterisk

694
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
but there's like a visual cortex in a

695
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,000
motor cortex and so on so this is in a

696
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,600
motor region of cortical architecture

697
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,158
that plays a certain biological function

698
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,840
the expectations are subtracted from the

699
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,039
incoming proprioceptive input

700
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,279
in the horn of the spinal cord this is

701
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,279
like lateral cut through a spinal cord

702
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,279
the horns are like the butterfly parts

703
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,559
and so there's a differencing between

704
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,760
the

705
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,640
incoming intensity of proprioception

706
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,399
and the brain

707
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,760
expected

708
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
expectations

709
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
and then the error drives muscle

710
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,880
activity

711
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
in the direction of suppression

712
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
so the motor activity is like reducing

713
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,440
the divergence

714
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,279
based upon the sign

715
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,159
and the intensity

716
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,600
of

717
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,559
the compromise between the brain's

718
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
expectations

719
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,279
potentially arising within like layer 5

720
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,919
from these bet cells

721
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
and the incoming sensory information

722
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,120
which can be modeled as like why

723
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,440
i think mu is probably the mean of that

724
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,159
expectation

725
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
um

726
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,640
i

727
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,720
don't know what part it was mentioned

728
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,559
um and then here's the

729
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,559
expectation the the

730
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,640
difference between these two it's like a

731
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,080
causal system flow but like a little

732
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,679
different

733
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,000
you're getting a 5 out of 10 pressure

734
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,159
you're expecting a 5 out of 10 pressure

735
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,399
the motor reflex is not engaged

736
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,240
you're getting a 7 out of 10 pressure

737
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,399
you're expecting 5 out of 10

738
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,320
there's like a negative 2 difference or

739
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,840
you know whichever way you want to be

740
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,679
subtracting there's like a 2 or a

741
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,279
negative 2 difference

742
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,440
and then that triggers like some motor

743
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,919
neuron units to fire

744
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,279
and then that

745
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,520
proportionally brings

746
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,120
the um

747
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
expectation

748
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,679
into alignment with the measurement

749
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
um

750
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,320
they're gonna just like that example

751
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
hinged from

752
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
a cortical layer and cell type

753
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,279
here is going to be hinging on the

754
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,080
cortex and looking to an output region

755
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,720
of the cortex

756
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,279
which is the striatum

757
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,519
and then they're going to do a more

758
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,440
detailed model of a basal ganglia

759
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,519
because it's been modeled a lot more and

760
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,159
then also have like just a textual

761
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,559
treatment of the thalamus

762
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
so

763
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
there's multiple papers on

764
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,240
dopamine

765
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,720
and active inference

766
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,039
and so um

767
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,240
from

768
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,000
2012 and then

769
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,519
2015

770
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,640
like

771
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,840
this is a really interesting

772
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,279
of research

773
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,640
with dopamine

774
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,840
because

775
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
dopamine is like classically

776
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,600
described as the reward molecule

777
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,919
more reward more dopamine lower reward

778
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,519
lower dopamine

779
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,640
um

780
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,799
so

781
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,640
isn't the whole

782
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,039
meme inactive that we replace the

783
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,399
reinforcement reward learning paradigm

784
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,760
with a

785
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
different

786
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,279
imperative that has elements that

787
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,600
reflect pragmatic value

788
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,360
but that isn't

789
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,799
the um overarching

790
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,600
uh

791
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,760
imperative for policy selection and so

792
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,039
these papers

793
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,559
show how like

794
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,399
in the context of a generative model

795
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,720
with expectations and preferences and

796
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
dope means signaling

797
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
something related to the predictive

798
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,840
processing of stimuli

799
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,919
under a mildly optimistic world model

800
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,679
good events and surprising events are

801
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,880
still associated with dopamine release

802
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,760
but

803
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
and things that are going worse than

804
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
expected are still associated with like

805
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
dopamine drops

806
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,880
but um

807
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
that actually is like a more unified way

808
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,720
to talk about

809
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
dopamine's

810
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,039
empirical outcomes

811
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
as opposed to the

812
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,880
reward learning which has to

813
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
hypothesize all of these like

814
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
modules that translate different kinds

815
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,879
of things into reward jessica

816
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,080
yeah no i think similarly to these i

817
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,399
don't remember where i read this but it

818
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,320
isn't like

819
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,559
the brain like in regards to like the

820
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,640
dopamine comment it's like it's also

821
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,440
like

822
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,279
the anticipation

823
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,640
on

824
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,559
of doing something and like the fact

825
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,279
that you're gonna get that dopamine kick

826
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,559
and

827
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,960
like you get basically you get a release

828
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,080
by anticipating something and that maybe

829
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,480
a little bit connects also with the

830
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,880
active inference the fact that you are

831
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,440
anticipating something

832
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,360
you know it's like you expect that to

833
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,919
happen and so you get that release of

834
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
the dopamine in anticipation of the

835
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,200
event happening so i

836
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
don't know much but like i'm thinking it

837
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,279
could be connected with

838
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,159
having like a predictive unexpected free

839
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,399
energy or something

840
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,479
nice good insight rohan

841
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,880
yeah uh i'm not uh

842
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,359
well i'm not a biologist but okay so i

843
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,480
just wanna

844
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,159
clarify there are

845
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,879
other systems in the body apart from

846
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,599
just the brain alone right so you have

847
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,040
like the autonomous uh or

848
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,399
what is it

849
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,000
parasympathetic nervous system that

850
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,159
controls your heart rate

851
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,560
uh your respiration and other things and

852
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,679
they and

853
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,000
also you have stuff like

854
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,119
adrenaline and not adrenaline uh

855
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,918
that do produce responses

856
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,918
and other hormones also that produce

857
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,040
responses like uh okay for hunger or

858
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,560
satisfaction

859
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,359
and we we basically have figured out how

860
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,679
to modulate these things to

861
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,440
solve modern issues

862
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,599
for things like obesity or something

863
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,960
like that and there are treatments

864
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,359
available that modify these hormones

865
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,839
levels right so

866
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,000
is it is this not a very limiting

867
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
perspective to look at dopamine alone as

868
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,079
the only thing and my other question

869
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,040
would be how does that convert

870
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,520
into say motor commands so i just

871
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,760
increase dopamine levels without any

872
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
stimulus whatsoever

873
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
let's say someone's taking a drug

874
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,200
it would

875
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,440
you say that that does not necessarily

876
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
translate to a motor command right so

877
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,040
how does it

878
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
uh do this is there's like a specialized

879
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,560
system

880
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,839
that figures out okay so here's uh

881
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,079
here's the previous action here's

882
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,400
increase in dopamine and here's how we

883
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,680
modulate to further increase dopamine

884
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,560
and

885
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,200
where exactly do you set limits on this

886
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
uh process

887
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
okay the two questions were about

888
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,200
interacting physiological systems and

889
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,359
the second one was about dope means role

890
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,119
in motor selection um blue go ahead if

891
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
it's related

892
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
um or if you want to address anything

893
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,119
yeah no i just wanted to respond like

894
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,920
the the dopamine response is like so um

895
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
there are a lot of interactions that are

896
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,400
happening in the nervous system dopamine

897
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,560
is one of the best understood i think

898
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,480
it's one of the ones that we've studied

899
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,680
for a long time

900
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,200
um and the if there's like an overload

901
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,800
of dopamine

902
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,280
the action can actually be non-specific

903
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,200
and that's what we see in parkinson's

904
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,880
right so it's like an overload of

905
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
dopamine into that

906
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,520
system and and it fries it out and then

907
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,280
you get non-specific

908
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,240
um

909
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,280
action

910
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,480
in the nervous system

911
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,440
motor action the tremors and stuff

912
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
um yes

913
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,359
good call and that like question about

914
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,240
um

915
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,880
like um non-purposeful behavior and

916
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,480
dopamine on the positive and on the

917
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,720
negative like failure to engage

918
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
initiate action

919
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
relating it like catatonic behavior and

920
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,839
then like hyper motor activity

921
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,680
associated with um repetitive motions

922
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,359
of various kinds

923
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,920
like dopey dopamine is known to be

924
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
different in people who are experiencing

925
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
that differently and modified by drugs

926
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,640
that target that like system so um

927
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,480
but to the first question about like

928
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,640
pluralism with respect to physiological

929
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,079
systems

930
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,160
for sure this model does not exclude

931
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,960
that

932
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,440
in fact its flexibility

933
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,839
is its advantage because the inputs to a

934
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,920
brain region now we could say well at

935
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,839
this time scale it's electrochemical and

936
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,240
at this time scale it's going to be just

937
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,920
um you know noradrenaline and someone

938
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,880
says well

939
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,560
how could you only model noradrenaline

940
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,240
say okay let's look at the model with no

941
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,000
adrenaline and this other one and an

942
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,760
unmodeled component

943
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,960
so

944
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,839
it will allow integration formally

945
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:48,800
of

946
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,880
physiological mechanisms that genuinely

947
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,280
interact and as to why people write like

948
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,599
specific papers about specific hormone

949
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,599
systems it's just like

950
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,480
what

951
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,200
is chunked off in that fractal and then

952
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,520
also one important note is like um

953
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,119
columbo and wright

954
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,040
have written about how like we don't

955
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,359
need a monolithic theory of any

956
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,680
neurotransmitter or any brain region

957
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,119
there might be like features or

958
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,920
components of dopaminergic systems

959
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,079
that it just explains and predicts that

960
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,680
they do reward

961
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,520
taken lightly that the explanation is

962
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,119
just of course our explanation of a

963
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,599
biological system

964
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,640
um

965
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,839
and also you raise like beyond the brain

966
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,839
there's also glia and other cell types

967
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,359
so yeah

968
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
the cool thing would be a framework

969
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,000
where we don't a priori exclude factors

970
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,599
that are important

971
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,680
um but just to kind of go quickly

972
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,480
through

973
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,839
the example and get to that motor

974
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,560
um

975
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,599
action

976
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,320
so this is an output from some putative

977
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,720
processing that happened in the cortex

978
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,280
and now it's projecting into some

979
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
dopaminergic regions

980
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,400
in the subcortical area

981
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,200
like the basal ganglia

982
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,480
um

983
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,119
it's going to be a model involving

984
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,960
outcomes o

985
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,400
the difference between the preferred and

986
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,079
the expected outcomes

987
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,880
the sigma squiggle expected free energy

988
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
evaluated for a policy and the um

989
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,760
posterior over policy is the bold pie

990
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,720
um the figure is like shown after a lot

991
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
of the description

992
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,880
but um

993
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,640
here is where they refer to the high and

994
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,800
low dopamine state so also like the the

995
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,280
movie slash book awakenings

996
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
is about um people who have like um

997
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,839
atypical dopamine signaling and then

998
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,440
they're given l-dopa and they like come

999
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,040
and like get re-invived with life and

1000
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,160
stuff um rohan

1001
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,280
yeah so

1002
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,720
well this is

1003
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,839
a little more general but okay when so

1004
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,160
we have the marco blanket and there are

1005
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,240
some internal states and the markov

1006
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,520
blanket

1007
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,200
basically connects us to the external

1008
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
states right

1009
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
uh or

1010
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,839
samples from the external states and

1011
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,640
then

1012
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,240
modulates the internal states

1013
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
accordingly

1014
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
uh okay so

1015
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,000
my question is i think if the if the

1016
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
first imperative is survival

1017
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,040
and the first imperative is to keep

1018
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,760
uh this system in homeostasis which is

1019
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,839
composed of multiple

1020
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,680
interlocking and interacting complex

1021
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,560
components right

1022
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,400
how exactly would you translate

1023
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,359
like these multiple signaling

1024
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,200
modalities with multiple hormones

1025
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,040
into maintaining homeostasis with

1026
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,960
something like free energy

1027
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
because some of these things are

1028
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,839
compatible entirely that like

1029
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,440
you would have to have some sort of

1030
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,599
translation mechanism right so

1031
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,160
let's say that adrenaline is jumping

1032
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,280
really high

1033
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,680
and into dangerously high levels but we

1034
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,760
only know it's dangerous because

1035
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,000
there is some system that is able to

1036
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,720
predict that okay it should not go above

1037
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,240
this level because it's going to screw

1038
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
up something else

1039
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
in the system right

1040
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,880
right

1041
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,520
multi-scale optimization and not over

1042
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,760
optimizing one lower level parameter at

1043
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,000
the cost of some higher order parameter

1044
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,280
yeah but then you

1045
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,440
come to the curse of dimensionality so

1046
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,640
how many

1047
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,000
uh different things are you going to

1048
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,680
take up before it becomes completely

1049
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,040
useless

1050
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,119
so absolutely good question empirical

1051
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,240
question

1052
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
yeah about what computational hardware

1053
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,800
what measurement data sets what sparsity

1054
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,319
of system graph

1055
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,359
what extent of application of heuristics

1056
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,440
how accurate you need that model to be

1057
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,240
in the empirical setting um none of it

1058
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,160
in principle um

1059
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,560
[Music]

1060
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,680
addressed by just the equations all of

1061
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
it related to how they're actually

1062
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
implemented at what scale

1063
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,760
just to quickly complete through here

1064
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,720
though

1065
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,560
this is about the depletion of dopamine

1066
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,240
is being observed

1067
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,079
um creating this akinesia failure to

1068
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,440
move

1069
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,119
and exogenous dopamine promotes

1070
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,720
impulsive behaviors of multiple

1071
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,800
different kinds

1072
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
um

1073
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
this is what

1074
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,720
it looks like

1075
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,000
dopamine as again stated here is

1076
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,240
balancing modulating the balance as a

1077
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,000
neuromodulator

1078
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,839
between inferring what to do and what

1079
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,359
not to do

1080
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,880
and so these

1081
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,280
two graphs

1082
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,119
both of them are getting

1083
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,720
outcomes

1084
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,560
from the cerebral cortex

1085
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,040
of the observations expected under a

1086
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,520
policy so those could be considered like

1087
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,680
predictions about at future sensory

1088
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,000
states

1089
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,920
here

1090
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,640
um and the gamma is this uncertainty

1091
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,280
that's being represented by dopamine in

1092
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,880
in a like

1093
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,359
in this uncertainty function of dopamine

1094
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:06,130
um

1095
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,359
[Music]

1096
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,240
in the direct pathway the policies and

1097
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,079
the difference between the preferences

1098
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,640
and expectations sigma squiggle with a

1099
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,839
tilde

1100
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,960
are being

1101
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,119
evaluated as part of the expected free

1102
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
energy of future policies

1103
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,200
and that is resulting in the selection

1104
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,640
of policies

1105
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,480
so that could be like thinking through

1106
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,400
all the chess moves and then picking the

1107
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,800
one with the lowest expected free energy

1108
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,079
here

1109
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,880
the output in the indirect pathway feeds

1110
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,920
into

1111
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,440
the prior

1112
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,800
vector e

1113
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,720
habit

1114
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,160
and then that

1115
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
influences policy

1116
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,440
through this

1117
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,520
acting anatomically proposed to this

1118
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
other region not as not defined with a

1119
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,280
specific variable so again this is not

1120
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,200
like saying like necessarily even just

1121
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,560
what it's doing this isn't the full

1122
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,280
model the papers read more but that's

1123
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,520
like with the two pathways of action

1124
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,720
selection

1125
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,560
and it's compatible with the empirical

1126
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,880
evidence from pathology and from

1127
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,960
pharmacology and genetic studies and

1128
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
animals other than humans

1129
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,079
and like

1130
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,359
this is um

1131
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,800
how it could be modeled with a base

1132
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,720
graph that recapitulates some of the

1133
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,119
architecture and the function

1134
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,079
then

1135
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
they describe the roles of some

1136
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
different neurotransmitters that have

1137
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,680
been

1138
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,280
modeled in

1139
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
active

1140
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,079
um

1141
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,359
and like what kinds of phenomena

1142
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,200
those measurements have been used

1143
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,400
in models

1144
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,000
um

1145
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
and then

1146
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,839
a one last important part

1147
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,119
it was in the section with the basal

1148
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,480
ganglia

1149
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,160
that was uh

1150
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,800
talking about this so they show the

1151
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,440
graph of the basal ganglia and then only

1152
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,040
in this last

1153
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,680
paragraph did they describe the thalamus

1154
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,440
so just say we're just going to do one

1155
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,200
paragraph on it

1156
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,960
but basically the thalamus has these two

1157
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,200
divisions

1158
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,880
and then they provide the um

1159
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,839
interpretation that these two divisions

1160
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,440
of the thalamus

1161
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,359
could reflect

1162
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,000
first and second order statistics

1163
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,560
on other

1164
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,680
types of senses and policies

1165
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,440
so that's like

1166
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,770
um

1167
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,200
[Music]

1168
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,800
a prediction a unique prediction that

1169
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,359
potentially modeling uh observed neural

1170
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,960
responses or the bold signal from um

1171
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,880
like the blood oxygen use

1172
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,960
in that region

1173
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,760
you'll make a better model if you fit

1174
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,720
into these categories rather than reward

1175
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,200
or rather than familiarity or any number

1176
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,520
of other criteria so just simply fitting

1177
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,720
better is not the whole substance of

1178
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,960
validating the formalisms described

1179
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,480
earlier

1180
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,200
but

1181
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,400
it's part of the empirical grounding and

1182
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,240
examples of like unique predictions and

1183
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
explanations that are provided by active

1184
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,240
inference

1185
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,800
and that but that was the thalamus part

1186
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,560
and then um

1187
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,760
in this very short section 5 6

1188
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,800
they

1189
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,720
talk about how

1190
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,920
a lot of our interfaces

1191
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,560
are continuous

1192
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,720
like sensory apparatus and motor

1193
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,880
apparatus have continuous aspects

1194
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,240
but then

1195
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,119
in the cognitive and decision-making

1196
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,040
domains

1197
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,680
there's often much more discreetness

1198
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,520
even if there's multi-scale discreteness

1199
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,839
resulting in like a very finely graded

1200
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,079
continuum of alternatives

1201
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,520
still there is

1202
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,400
um discreteness involved

1203
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,880
and this was explored

1204
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,520
a lot more fully

1205
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,400
in the 46 live streams

1206
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,680
active inference models do not

1207
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
contradict folk psychology

1208
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,720
where they

1209
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,280
really clarify this is motor active

1210
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,359
inference in the continuous domain this

1211
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,960
is decision making active inference in

1212
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,400
the discrete domain

1213
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,240
here's what a hybrid model looks like

1214
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,560
blue

1215
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,880
oh do i still my hand up sorry oh spin

1216
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,000
up

1217
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,760
yeah so then they just basically say

1218
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,920
um some of these models dealt with

1219
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,000
continuous phenomena

1220
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,480
like specifically the reflex arc example

1221
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,960
hashtag active inference in continuous

1222
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,680
time figure 4 3 etc

1223
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,359
and then other models presented in this

1224
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,880
chapter

1225
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,720
are compatible with discrete

1226
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,880
alternatives like discrete variables for

1227
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,520
example policy selections

1228
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,359
if there's two model policy outcomes

1229
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,760
then this is like a discrete model or

1230
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,599
the observations could be happening

1231
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,119
through discrete time so it's like

1232
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,680
different opportunities for discreteness

1233
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,960
and

1234
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,839
continuous models and variables

1235
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,180
to be integrated

1236
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,920
[Music]

1237
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,280
in

1238
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,000
these architectures

1239
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,800
then

1240
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,480
in summary

1241
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,599
they're

1242
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,800
outlining the points of connection

1243
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,040
between the message passing

1244
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
implied by the generative models of

1245
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,319
chapter four

1246
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,319
which we asked you not to read

1247
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,920
gently

1248
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,880
and

1249
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,599
the neurobiology of inference action and

1250
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,359
planning

1251
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,800
and then here's going to be like a

1252
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,640
summary figure

1253
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,598
for the chapter

1254
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,240
the top row is showing some

1255
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,720
computational motifs

1256
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,359
that are plausible or compatible with

1257
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,280
different like subsets of cells and

1258
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,599
regions in cortex

1259
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,400
the bottom region are showing some

1260
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,160
extracortical

1261
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,280
structures

1262
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,000
on the left is the basal ganglia

1263
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,440
shown from like one of the previous

1264
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,720
figures

1265
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
so it's a subcortical structure within

1266
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,440
the brain

1267
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,480
here is a spinal cord

1268
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,559
um cross section

1269
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,200
and one can imagine that like other

1270
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,359
structures within the brain and outside

1271
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,480
the brain

1272
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,720
would be amenable to also this kind of

1273
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,160
graph

1274
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
and they're just doing like kind of

1275
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,240
linking now even the models together

1276
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,359
and then

1277
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,520
showing the difference in planning like

1278
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,359
on the left side the basal ganglia is

1279
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,319
getting this preference difference

1280
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,079
is connecting to the expected free

1281
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,680
energy so

1282
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,680
future policies are being evaluated

1283
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,119
policies are being evaluated on the

1284
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,040
basis of their future ability to align

1285
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,800
with preferences

1286
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,440
in this pathway

1287
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,680
here that's planning

1288
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,040
habits

1289
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,160
are when the not the preference

1290
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,558
versus

1291
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,920
expectation um difference

1292
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,640
but

1293
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,000
the outcomes themselves are going to e

1294
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,720
and

1295
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,880
habits are being followed which could be

1296
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,440
seen as multi-scale habits

1297
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,280
and that's influencing policy

1298
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,359
and then here's where that kind of

1299
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,000
continuous decision and modulated

1300
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,559
handoff between more planning like and

1301
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,640
more habitual

1302
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,200
is being related

1303
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,480
to the motor implementation

1304
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,720
of the expectations

1305
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,520
of the proprioceptive loops

1306
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,640
so like i want to be sitting still

1307
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,319
and then all of your muscles in a

1308
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,599
healthy situation are like not moving

1309
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,160
versus like i want my leg again speaking

1310
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,760
like loosely slash

1311
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,680
you know with it i want type word but

1312
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,839
just like i want to lift my leg

1313
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,760
that model

1314
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,559
the expectations have to be updated

1315
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,599
to allow the leg to realize being up

1316
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,000
using a non we don't say well it's more

1317
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,960
rewarding for the leg to be up

1318
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,800
we can just say this is

1319
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,640
a computational architecture that

1320
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,319
facilitated that

1321
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,240
and inc and generalizes to like

1322
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,559
multi-step planning

1323
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,319
and then there's been multiple papers

1324
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,960
2017 and beyond

1325
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,119
that like summarized and elaborated on

1326
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,559
different aspects of this

1327
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,200
more complex continuous architectures

1328
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,359
more complex motor

1329
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,760
discrete interfacing more complex

1330
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,359
decision making active inference of

1331
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,558
course rohan

1332
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,079
uh yeah i'm just wondering because a lot

1333
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,119
of this has to do with high level uh

1334
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,040
more abstract behaviors or kind of

1335
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,119
abstract behaviors right

1336
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,000
so is there any attempt made

1337
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,400
to apply this to something simpler like

1338
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,640
the autonomous uh

1339
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,040
nervous system because not every signal

1340
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,880
goes through to the brain right so that

1341
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,800
we just go to the spinal cord and we

1342
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,200
know this because if the spinal damage

1343
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,040
you can't

1344
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,280
sometimes people can't walk or they have

1345
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,960
trouble rebreathing and so on because

1346
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,680
not

1347
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,480
so or in other animals like the

1348
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,960
cuttlefish for example that

1349
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,400
changes in the pigmentation of the

1350
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,599
skin

1351
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,520
is not dependent on

1352
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,920
brain movement uh on brain activity it's

1353
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,160
just

1354
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,920
autonomous

1355
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,880
right so it does this war has there been

1356
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,760
any attempt made to apply

1357
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,319
this to much more

1358
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,040
uh

1359
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,280
you know those kind of systems

1360
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,720
um well

1361
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,800
uh how simple or complex the system is

1362
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,680
is

1363
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,280
kind of a it's kind of like how

1364
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,040
complexly we approach it because people

1365
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,520
have been modeling single cell

1366
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
um graphs

1367
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,040
if that could be seen as the simplest

1368
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,839
electrochemical decision maker as well

1369
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:01,839
as um morphological computing

1370
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,200
and yeah there's probably a paucity of

1371
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,119
published models

1372
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,160
on

1373
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,000
autonomic nervous system active

1374
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,599
inference models

1375
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,760
so there are many opportunities because

1376
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,480
they cited a huge amount of the neural

1377
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,880
empirical work here

1378
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,720
with the goal being to summarize sort of

1379
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,400
the tip of the iceberg

1380
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,200
but

1381
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,800
like there aren't

1382
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,680
um

1383
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,960
models

1384
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,920
like this for every single function or

1385
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,240
region or or anything

1386
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,920
nor even if there were would it be the

1387
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,079
end of research in that area

1388
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,040
so yeah there's a lot of open space to

1389
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,960
build specific models which is exactly

1390
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,280
what section six and beyond and part two

1391
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,359
will take us to which is to go from like

1392
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,200
identifying it we can quickly find out

1393
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,280
whether it's been published or not

1394
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,680
um and then build that model with the

1395
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,280
inputs and outputs that people are

1396
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,119
seeing as relevance

1397
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,960
rowan

1398
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,880
uh yeah i'm sorry for

1399
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,640
monopolizing this

1400
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,960
question time i'm sorry so i'm just

1401
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,400
curious if this has been applied to

1402
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
non-biological systems in any way

1403
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,720
because that seems to be something that

1404
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,559
we could easily do right

1405
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,040
because we have plenty of data

1406
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,200
right now okay so can we is there

1407
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,520
anything like a better

1408
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,920
vision model than a convolutional neural

1409
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,400
net for example or

1410
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,800
some sort of swarm robotics

1411
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,000
uh

1412
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,640
attempt using something like this

1413
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,160
or even like uh

1414
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,079
game playing or something because i

1415
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,599
would be interested to

1416
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,440
read

1417
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,160
many many of these things have been um

1418
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,880
sketched or are in progress we have our

1419
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,400
project ideas

1420
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,880
in these like last minutes

1421
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,000
there's

1422
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,200
a lot of

1423
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,640
room for

1424
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,960
building projects and there's a huge

1425
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,200
value to creative

1426
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,119
ideation of like areas where it could be

1427
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,240
applied

1428
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,000
and also value for checking the

1429
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,359
literature for

1430
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,680
where it might have been like a a model

1431
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,240
could be reused like a visual foraging

1432
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,280
model

1433
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,359
that was from about cultural acquisition

1434
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,799
of pattern preference

1435
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,280
was repurposed for our aunt stigma g

1436
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,160
model

1437
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,319
just by adding a pheromone trace

1438
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,559
so there isn't like a cookbook on what

1439
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,640
is out there or how models could be

1440
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,880
modified

1441
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,599
we hope that with active block for ins

1442
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,720
and

1443
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,960
documentation it'll be clearer and

1444
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
clearer for people

1445
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,880
to build generative models and compose

1446
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,920
them and explore different modules

1447
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,880
so it should just be done

1448
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,040
yeah okay thank you

1449
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,400
any last thoughts or questions on

1450
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,880
chapter 5 and then next week we'll

1451
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,200
return to the more specific

1452
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,680
questions

1453
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,720
ali and and then anyone else would like

1454
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,759
a closing thought on chapter five

1455
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,599
yeah i just want to mention um thomas

1456
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,520
pars the

1457
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,040
speech uh in the i think it was a

1458
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,440
few weeks ago in the center for

1459
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,599
cognitive neuroscience berlin

1460
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,720
which i'm putting the link here in which

1461
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,520
he explained most of these topics and

1462
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,720
some more

1463
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,400
uh in perhaps a more accessible way so

1464
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,480
if anyone wants to

1465
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,280
yes that's it if anyone wants to watch

1466
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,400
it i think

1467
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,720
uh that can help in understanding the

1468
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,680
content of this chapter

1469
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,440
nice thank you

1470
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,480
yep

1471
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,440
looks like a good one to watch and using

1472
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,280
like the same figures

1473
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,880
so that's pretty maybe we could you know

1474
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,720
annotate like the figure to say at this

1475
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,680
time step here's where it's described

1476
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,720
um

1477
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,680
okay

1478
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,240
so those who want to um feel free to

1479
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,079
stay in this room for dot tools

1480
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,319
otherwise thanks for joining and see you

1481
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,480
next week
