Just put a check mark if you want to stay in.	This is cohort One textbook group week ten, chapter five	CURRENT BOOK CURRENT GROUP WEEK 10, CHAPTER 5
73780	267680	01:13	Mike: Let's start with any general thoughts that people had about chapter five. I think chapter five needs a lot of Neurobiological background and without necessary requisites, it can be probably Daunting chapter. Anyone who can capture questions that people are asking here, just add them.	Mike: I think chapter five needs a lot of Neurobiological background	Chapter 5
270620	652710	04:30	The chapter is titled message Passing in Neurobiology. The quote might have a little bit of hyperbole comedy, like two types of animals, plants. Research has been emerging that kind of bestow consciousness to plants. How does this transition the book towards focusing on these empirical cases?	Message Passing was brought up in previous chapter in this box 4.1	Message Passing in Neurobiology
652780	950540	10:52	Mike: This is the first instance in the book where they are making a serious effort to tie out to real world observations. They're not trying to write a neuro textbook here, but to touch kind of like with both feet, the empirical modeling. With a densely linked and interdisciplinary area, then the linearity becomes challenging.

952030	1495230	15:52	The first system that they're focusing on is the cortical column. cortex has traditionally been thought of as the seat of both consciousness intelligence and also, of course, cognition. Recent studies have shown that consciousness actually stems from literally the brain stem, not necessarily the cortex. Jeff: How do we think about redundancies in systems in the context of active inference?	For decades, cortex has been thought of as the seat of consciousness intelligence	The role of the cortex in AI

There's a generalization statistical architecture that has compatibility with the neural architecture of the brain. So that allows this statistical model to be explaining and predicting and useful about the brain, which is like what computational neuroscience does.

The expectations are subtracted from the incoming proprioceptive input in the horn of a spinal cord. There's multiple papers on dopamine and active inference and so from 2012 and then 2015.

2453026	3234836	40:53	In cognitive and decision making domains there's often much more discreteness. Multi scale optimization and not over optimizing one lower level parameter at the cost of some higher order parameter. How many different things are you going to take up before it comes completely useless?

3235028	3341690	53:55	Has this been applied to non biological systems in any way? Is there anything like a better vision model than a convolutional neural net. Many of these things have been sketched or are in progress. There's a lot of room for building projects.

3344300	3423270	55:44	Any last thoughts or questions on chapter five? And then next week, we'll return to the more specific questions. I just want to mention Thomas Parr's speech. If anyone wants to watch it, I think that can help in understanding the content of this chapter.	Any last thoughts or questions on chapter five?
