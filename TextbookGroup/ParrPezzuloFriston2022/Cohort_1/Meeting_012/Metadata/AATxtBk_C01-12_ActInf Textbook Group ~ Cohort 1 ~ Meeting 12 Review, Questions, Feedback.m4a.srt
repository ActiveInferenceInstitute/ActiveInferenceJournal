1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to week twelve

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,320
of active textbook group cohort one.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,750
We are in the Review and Synthesis

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,342
weeks. It's been a great three

5
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:23,454
monthish journey and it

6
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:25,942
doesn't stop here but we'll will go over

7
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:29,286
that. So two points of

8
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,862
process for those who are here live and

9
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:35,106
of course re watching and then we'll

10
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:38,202
move to the more conceptual parts. So

11
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:41,974
first in the onboarding page you'll

12
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:44,886
see these two columns. The two columns

13
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:48,934
are Rcping yes to join Cohort

14
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,514
Two, part one going through chapters one

15
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,518
through five if you would like to for a

16
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:56,462
second time. Many people will be just

17
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:59,614
doing it for fun or for learning or

18
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:02,014
however they want. And also there's the

19
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:04,654
opportunity to continue on with the

20
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:07,346
second half of the textbook which is

21
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,714
going to get into a lot of the hands on

22
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:12,722
modeling and we'll be especially looking

23
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:14,722
forward to developing a lot of the

24
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:17,286
notebooks and interactive formats that

25
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:19,106
will help us get a lot of understanding

26
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:22,838
there. So please check yes

27
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,550
for whichever row your name is in for

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,906
whether you would like to continue on

29
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:32,314
with part two as well as

30
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:35,980
retake part one as well.

31
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,866
You'd be welcome to be just a

32
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:41,098
participant and also feel free to get in

33
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:43,358
touch if you are interested in taking

34
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:45,406
some other role such as like

35
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:47,562
facilitating or scaffolding some aspect

36
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:49,966
but we can talk more about that for

37
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,650
those who are interested. So point one

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,986
go to the onboarding list and continue

39
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:58,740
on however you want.

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,562
Second point if you go to Future

41
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,990
Textbook Groups page you'll see an

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,006
embedded form as well as a link to the

43
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,534
form if you want it in a new window like

44
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:14,466
that. This would be exceptionally

45
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:18,298
requested and helpful for you to provide

46
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,634
some evaluations numerically and as

47
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,098
short or as long as you want on

48
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:27,034
providing feedback. Those are one

49
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:28,422
way that you can provide feedback

50
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:32,350
anonymously. The second way is building

51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,222
on some of the ideas that people are

52
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,274
already adding here. This is an editable

53
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:40,734
page, so people can add thoughts as

54
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,082
they see fit about what would be awesome

55
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,906
for future textbook groups or any other

56
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,530
feedback. Or, as always, they can email

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,994
Activeinference@gmail.com if they want,

58
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:53,780
like a response to any specific points.

59
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,726
And then also it's provided here at the

60
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:58,566
link to Share for people who want to

61
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:01,606
join future cohorts. So that link will

62
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,218
be like getting people onboarded

63
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:07,922
into the next cohort which is September

64
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:10,618
2022 in this case. But this is going to

65
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,594
be like an evergreen form that will just

66
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:15,146
continue to have a list of people who

67
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,726
expressed interest and be onboarding

68
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:20,398
them into subsequent cohorts of which

69
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:23,534
will begin several per year going

70
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:24,160
forward.

71
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,166
And next week we'll be talking more

72
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:34,530
about the feedback specifically

73
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,446
and about projects and about carrying

74
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:41,922
on. Today is like a little bit of a more

75
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:45,234
conceptual synthesis and review and

76
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,062
again next week will be more like

77
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:50,610
logistical and project oriented

78
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,654
review. So just on these points or

79
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,294
anything else, does anyone want to just

80
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:58,810
raise their hand or unmute and share

81
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,330
anything that they liked?

82
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,472
Okay, let us conceptually

83
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:34,832
review, then we

84
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,104
read the first five chapters of the

85
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:38,800
active inference textbook.

86
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,426
Does anyone have overall thoughts that

87
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:47,002
they'd like to provide at the five

88
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:49,566
chapter scale? Then we're going to go

89
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:52,014
into a chapter scale. Then we'll be

90
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:56,042
continuing to dive in as Granularly

91
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:59,006
as required. But at the scale of the

92
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:01,394
first five chapters, you can see them

93
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:05,154
here on this preface page as

94
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,380
well as here in the chapters list.

95
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,938
As a unit of five chapters,

96
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,000
what were people's sense?

97
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,726
How did it update? Yes, please, Ben.

98
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,306
And then Ali. Well, I was just going to

99
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,854
say, I think, as I've said to people

100
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:33,618
before, I think, coming from a non

101
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,366
mathematics background, I thought that

102
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:37,286
these chapters were really accessible in

103
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:40,354
terms of the kind of conceptual things

104
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:41,814
that they were putting on the table.

105
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,446
But I just wondered what other people's

106
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:49,174
opinions were in terms of understanding

107
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:51,446
the conceptual toolkit of active

108
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,446
inference before you've built up a kind

109
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,862
of mathematical understanding, because

110
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,678
I'm about to start kind of learning some

111
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:01,566
of the mathematics behind it. And I

112
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:04,446
wondered what people thought of the

113
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:06,634
potential to fully grasp these concepts

114
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:07,986
without the mathematics and what the

115
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,346
relationship between the two might be.

116
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,786
I'm just curious what other people think

117
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:11,860
about that, I guess.

118
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,754
Thanks. Great question, Ali and then

119
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,390
Mike and then anyone else who wants to

120
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,400
chime in.

121
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,764
Yeah, it was a pretty exciting journey

122
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:28,936
for me, but I'll definitely need

123
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,572
to read over all those five chapters

124
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:34,892
once again, at least once again in order

125
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:38,568
to grasp more fully the contents

126
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:42,988
of those chapters. My own personal

127
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:47,340
opinion about the way Materials

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,576
is organized in the first part of the

129
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,192
textbook is I

130
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:57,830
couldn't see a kind of hierarchical or,

131
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I don't know, structural organization

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,316
for these chapters as much as I like to.

133
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:09,592
See them because sometimes they

134
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:14,532
delve into theoretical

135
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,176
aspect of all the things much more

136
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,304
deeply than the mathematical side. And

137
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:22,844
sometimes it's vice versa. But I

138
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:26,076
think that if it was organized in

139
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,356
a way that, as Ben mentioned, we can

140
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,656
go from a firm conceptual

141
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:37,692
foundation into the granular formalism

142
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:41,072
and mathematics, at least for me,

143
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:45,020
that would be much more accessible

144
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,448
and much more I would be able to

145
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,636
organize the materials in a much more

146
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:55,044
coherent way in my mind. So one

147
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,692
thing that I really

148
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:02,330
enjoyed about these chapters is the

149
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,104
kind of you

150
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,930
see a kind of the vision it

151
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,152
tries to put forward regarding

152
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:21,964
the future possible research and also

153
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:24,944
things especially in chapter five and

154
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:27,904
the path that can be taken from this

155
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,816
point on. Thank you,

156
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:33,410
Ali. Mike and then anyone else?

157
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,204
Yeah, I'll pick up from where Ali left

158
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:40,976
off, I think it's somewhat remarkable

159
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,852
that they were able to fit everything

160
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,540
they did into those first five chapters.

161
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,792
And understanding. They probably had

162
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,472
some idea of how much space they wanted

163
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:54,184
in that part of the book before getting

164
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:56,932
into the practical or applied

165
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,810
components. In part two,

166
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,870
the high road, low road contrast and

167
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,276
sort of coming at the problem from two

168
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,500
different angles I think was useful.

169
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,796
Like Ben, I found the math to be

170
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:18,000
generally accessible, although I confess

171
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,856
I think I still go through this sort of

172
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,608
pattern where I feel like I get it and I

173
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,576
have this intuitive understanding of it.

174
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,316
But then there are things where I sort

175
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,828
of bogged down and looking at some of

176
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:34,996
the mathematical details or some of the

177
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:38,144
graphical representations related

178
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:41,656
to things like message passing have to

179
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:44,468
slow down and sort of take those apart

180
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:48,376
more. And I guess related to

181
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:51,128
that, I should add, I think this group

182
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:53,644
has been so good at taking apart the

183
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:56,876
ideas of the book. This is perhaps one

184
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:58,780
of the most effective settings I've seen

185
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,584
for really wringing concepts

186
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:05,664
out of a text. And the work that's going

187
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,376
on with the coda to build up the

188
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,484
ontology and take apart the equations

189
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,296
and things like that I think is just

190
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:14,850
tremendous awesome. Thank you.

191
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,180
The British call them maths, plural

192
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,764
instead of math as an area. And it

193
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:30,164
really does engage. Like there's

194
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,904
visual formalisms which could be

195
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,336
represented with a sparsity matrix or it

196
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:38,584
could be represented with other ways.

197
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:42,616
But there are almost like a

198
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,500
multiscale diversity of formalisms

199
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,176
ranging from more traditional equal

200
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,228
sign in the middle mathematics to

201
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:56,960
fusion, schematic, equation graphics,

202
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,352
different types of notations even within

203
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:08,416
the equation. And the difficulty

204
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:12,230
is not

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,844
signaled. Not that it has to be, but the

206
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,644
difficulty does provide a little

207
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:22,040
whiplash sometimes because it moves

208
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,616
variously in the main thread of the

209
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:27,960
text, the boxes and the appendices from

210
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,560
like, this is how linear algebra works

211
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,070
and this is what Bayes theorem is

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,612
all the way to. Topics that are

213
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,744
approaching physics flows on partitioned

214
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:43,390
states,

215
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,136
various kinds of fundamental, or like in

216
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,296
principle, relationships about

217
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:53,120
mathematics generally.

218
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,460
All the way to postulated

219
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,472
architectures where message passing

220
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:06,564
is implemented to achieve some

221
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,556
computational function and or thread the

222
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:11,440
needle with resembling neuro

223
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,304
computational architectures. The math is

224
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,600
doing a lot. Many things are happening

225
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,652
and so it's only

226
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:25,420
to be expected that the perception is

227
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,256
challenging and there's

228
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:32,910
probably a lot more to even say and

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,056
unpack there. Anyone else want to raise

230
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,850
their hand and give a thought on this

231
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,130
section? One Area.

232
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,630
JF and Then anyone Else.

233
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,030
Have kind. Of A general Question about

234
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,660
The Limits Of Mathematics,

235
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,156
the Notion Of Computational

236
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:12,104
irreducibility that You

237
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:15,624
Have To Go Through Every Step Of A

238
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,420
Process to Get At State n plus.

239
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,164
One from state n from state

240
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:27,548
n minus whatever. That certain

241
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:32,256
problems cannot be solved by

242
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,088
plugging values into a formula and

243
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:38,096
generating a future state. You have to

244
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,970
compute all the intermediate states.

245
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,964
I wonder where that fits in in this

246
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:48,644
picture. Are there hard limits to the

247
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:52,948
application of mathematics to

248
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,536
the problem of active inference? It's

249
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,810
just a general question.

250
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:20,098
Returning to some earlier comments

251
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,910
on the firm conceptual ground,

252
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,334
what is an area, no matter how narrow

253
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,610
or distal, from active, where people

254
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,386
believe that there is a

255
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,166
firm conceptual ground, they felt like

256
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,438
that provided a foundation for them to

257
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:43,006
learn further. Are we seeking an

258
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:47,390
analogy to some other field

259
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,026
of theory or practice or domain? Or are

260
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:53,870
we kind of seeking for an epistemic

261
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,860
territory that we haven't quite seen?

262
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,942
I'll just add I think that what

263
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:15,814
inactive inference, what you're talking

264
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:18,546
about there, Jeff, is literally blankets

265
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:22,482
and uncertainty, like the corollary

266
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,006
there of, like, computation and

267
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:26,454
irreducibility is that there's some

268
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,398
large amount of uncertainty in hidden

269
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:29,626
states in the world that you're just

270
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,074
never going to get at. The blanket is in

271
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:35,834
some sense not just how you're relating

272
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:40,400
to it, but some hard

273
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,614
limit on your

274
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,100
surprisal and things like that.

275
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,912
Thanks. Brock Blue had written

276
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,230
yes, Mike, please.

277
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,610
So responding to the question about

278
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,556
maybe adjacent SpaceX or spaces or topic

279
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:09,364
areas, I think there's certainly overlap

280
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:12,604
with concepts from system dynamics. And

281
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,296
certainly a lot of agent based modeling

282
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:17,356
has been applied to model systems that

283
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,752
have feedback loops and adaptation,

284
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:24,232
things like that. We discussed during

285
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,016
the past weeks relationships with

286
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:29,584
reinforcement learning. And I think

287
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,700
there's a belief that active inference

288
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,416
kind of cleans up some of the

289
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:37,084
challenging, or maybe not challenging,

290
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:40,544
but less formalized or less defined

291
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:42,144
aspects related to reinforcement

292
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:45,536
learning, such as how do you engineer

293
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:48,196
a utility function that makes sense in

294
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:49,488
the context of what you're trying to

295
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:50,090
model?

296
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,800
Thanks agreed about creating an

297
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,240
integrated utility function.

298
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,558
There's so many unprincipled,

299
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:14,186
not to say ineffective or not even to

300
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,574
say not elegant but unprincipled methods

301
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:21,290
of creating a chimera utility

302
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,830
model like delay, discounting,

303
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,738
novelty, bonus, curiosity,

304
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:31,386
bonuses, alternating phases

305
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:33,230
or hyperparameters,

306
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,630
as well as purely implementational

307
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,850
strategies like discarding burn in

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,370
parallel chains. There's like a whole

309
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,818
toolkit and indeed fields on creating

310
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:52,562
effectively integrated

311
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:59,082
utility models and putting

312
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:03,146
that work into the construction of the

313
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:06,506
generative model. And how the

314
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,218
generative model is partitioned from the

315
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:12,138
generative process allows

316
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:15,534
a generic free energy functional or set

317
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:19,470
of related free energy formulations to

318
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,806
play that role. So that's

319
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:26,450
one very interesting angle,

320
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,402
as well as the way that that process of

321
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,066
specifying the generative model and

322
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:36,180
generative processes and so on are

323
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,762
world models, whether in the

324
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,366
Yon Lacoun sense or in the

325
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:47,234
Adam Safron sense. These generative

326
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:50,102
models encompass world models and deep

327
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,862
learning approaches and various topics

328
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:54,780
like that.

329
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,482
So let's see. Blue wrote,

330
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:03,438
I wish there was practice problems in

331
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,230
the book to develop our understanding

332
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,600
yes,

333
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,002
to a large extent. And also whether

334
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,050
people want to reflect on any specific

335
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,050
questions or even just on this scheme.

336
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,300
These are many of these questions.

337
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,998
These questions can be open,

338
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:34,678
infinite game type questions about

339
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:37,666
the material. They can be clearly

340
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,066
addressable questions about the

341
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:45,014
material. They can be checks

342
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,914
for understanding, but we'll be

343
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,154
continuing to develop and improve and

344
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:54,430
curate questions around the material.

345
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,922
So I think it's a great comment

346
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,238
and this is why we have this

347
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:05,314
future textbook groups and all of these

348
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:07,902
affordances for people to stay involved

349
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:11,202
and be improving this, as well as

350
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:14,386
experimenting in their own spaces and

351
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,826
ways to develop the kinds of material

352
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:21,046
that are helping them learn and

353
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:25,862
understand any

354
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:30,102
more. Section one overview

355
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,210
thoughts,

356
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,130
chapters one through five and

357
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,226
the framing of the book being that the

358
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:43,934
first five chapters are more focused on

359
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:47,310
the conceptual background and the second

360
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,942
five chapters are going to be starting

361
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,906
with a recipe for designing the active

362
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:54,786
models and getting more into the

363
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:55,780
modeling itself.

364
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,378
So any section one through five

365
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:29,564
commentary the

366
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,580
book comprises two parts, page three.

367
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,356
These are aimed at readers who want to

368
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,796
understand active inference first part,

369
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:38,896
and those who seek to use it for their

370
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:42,256
own research second part. The first

371
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:43,836
part of the book introduces active

372
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:46,224
inference, both conceptually and

373
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:48,352
formally contextualizing it within

374
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,080
current theories of cognition.

375
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,516
How did they succeed and

376
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,500
where? Was there a divergence between

377
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,344
what you preferred a priori or

378
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:12,208
now comprehensive,

379
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:14,336
formal and self contained introduction

380
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:17,296
to active inference, its main constructs

381
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,996
and implications for the study of brain

382
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:19,960
and cognition?

383
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,252
I'm interested in the distinction

384
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:38,692
between understanding active inference

385
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:43,016
and using it for our own research and

386
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:44,664
the way that that's set up as those

387
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:46,650
being two completely separate things.

388
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,408
It seems to suggest that one could fully

389
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:54,316
understand active inference and yet not

390
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,316
be in a position to use it in their own

391
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:58,716
research, not having worked through the

392
00:22:58,738 --> 00:22:59,928
second half of the book. And I think

393
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:00,930
that's quite interesting.

394
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,210
It is. Good comment. Thank you.

395
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,356
Not to spoil the ending, but the

396
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:16,036
last sentence is ultimately we are

397
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,556
confident that you will continue to

398
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:19,750
pursue active inference in some form.

399
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,140
There may be a multi year incubation

400
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,944
for different people in contexts many

401
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:35,816
people now or even in some amazing

402
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:38,556
decentralized science future. They may

403
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:40,344
not think of themselves as researchers

404
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,030
or of doing research,

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,270
though they may be even included on

406
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,428
research projects. So it's

407
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:54,690
a very interesting comment about

408
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,784
how they distinguish theory and

409
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:02,900
learning from part

410
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,940
two, research and practice,

411
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,670
however they

412
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,340
discuss applications.

413
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,350
But this isn't the playbook,

414
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,626
it's not the toolkit, it's not the

415
00:24:22,648 --> 00:24:24,850
modeling tool ecosystem.

416
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,530
Mike.

417
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,014
Yeah, that's an interesting comment at

418
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,486
the end, and I don't know if this is my

419
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:36,726
perceptual bias, but there seems to be

420
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:39,746
this implicit assumption that active

421
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,946
inference is the way to go. Basically,

422
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:45,802
this is the tool to use within

423
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:49,066
the text. As a

424
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,814
result, what's not there is a discussion

425
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:55,006
of maybe these are cases where you might

426
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:57,358
not want to use active inference, or

427
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,274
these are cases where applying active

428
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:01,822
inference could create challenges in

429
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,280
what you're solving for.

430
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,500
Ali and anyone else.

431
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,582
And in fact, one of the most popular

432
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:21,366
criticisms put toward the active

433
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,054
inference or FEP in general is that it

434
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:28,426
tries to explain everything. It ends

435
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:29,840
up explaining nothing.

436
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,210
Yeah, I think there's a risk of maybe

437
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,186
not sufficiently constraining the

438
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,754
problem space or leaving things

439
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:46,098
undefined in a way that allow

440
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,954
for active insurance to be the solution

441
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:51,000
without a critical point of view.

442
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,174
They highlight behavior

443
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:23,482
and cognition. I mean, one could almost

444
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:27,046
see even the name active

445
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:31,374
inference as being a synthesis of

446
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:35,098
action behavior and cognition

447
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,510
inference in ways that as we're

448
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,566
discovering and unpacking, they're

449
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:45,006
integrated in ways that other formalisms

450
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,066
of perception as a type of

451
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:49,826
cognition. So we could just lump it

452
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:53,026
there other frameworks of behavior and

453
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:56,174
cognition have

454
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:59,320
not integrated or have approached from a

455
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,806
non first principles. Or maybe they do

456
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,454
follow first principles, like the higher

457
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,390
the impact factor, the better the paper,

458
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,154
something like that. That's a first

459
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:11,290
principle. No, just kidding.

460
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,694
But placing it within the framework

461
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:22,122
of cognition while also surfing

462
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:26,222
on a wave of something

463
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:28,814
like Pan cognitivism or like pan

464
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:34,680
computationalism does

465
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,142
expand the scope. And that's even

466
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:42,614
before one starts to enter into

467
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:44,360
the more recent research,

468
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,942
especially where there is a highlight

469
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:52,650
on system persistence,

470
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,426
not simply in terms of the resistance to

471
00:27:56,448 --> 00:28:00,126
dissipation entropically, but in a

472
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:02,186
relational context as repeated

473
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,720
measurements, like in the quantum work.

474
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,762
So it's like cognition. Oh, like brains,

475
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:12,834
like that schema with the brain or with

476
00:28:12,872 --> 00:28:16,958
like a person. Well, oh, by cognition,

477
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:21,566
it's any system with a blanket

478
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,554
that we're interacting with through

479
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:27,186
repeated measurement. Is that cognition?

480
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:30,230
Where did cognition go? Brock.

481
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,126
I kind of want to, I guess, echo all

482
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,894
those things that were just said about a

483
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:43,338
common criticism and this where does it

484
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,162
apply? Where does it not apply? But

485
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:48,746
also, I guess all

486
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,510
those things that you were just listing.

487
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,822
I always hear that from people that have

488
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:57,406
not engaged with

489
00:28:57,428 --> 00:29:01,520
the material and from

490
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,394
my engagement with it, it seems like all

491
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:10,100
of the examples in which it is used are

492
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,786
complex, dynamical systems that don't

493
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:17,080
have great, that have, at best,

494
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,440
mathematical approximations and have

495
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,718
almost no or literally no kind of

496
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,150
analytical approaches.

497
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,614
It just seems like a good way to model a

498
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:34,102
system of things, of entities that are

499
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:38,278
interacting. And I

500
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:41,438
guess what I'm to put it

501
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:44,974
into one question is that kind of some

502
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:47,262
anthropomorphizing or whatever

503
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:50,698
projecting of like, well, it's applied

504
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,974
to this, it's applied to that, it must

505
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:55,586
apply to everything. And how can it

506
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:57,058
apply to all those things? How can it

507
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,946
apply everywhere? It's not applying to

508
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:00,786
everywhere. It's just applying to these

509
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,734
complex systems which are everywhere but

510
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,126
also don't have and we're not trying to

511
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:08,802
model the apple falling from the tree

512
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:12,786
or. These. Sorts of simple cases

513
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:14,274
or something. It's not being applied

514
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:18,098
there, is it? I haven't seen actually,

515
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:21,162
now that I think about it, any of those

516
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:23,638
sorts of situations where it's applied

517
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:25,980
to things that we already understand,

518
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,274
maybe in some back checking way, but not

519
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:31,534
in a way that's suggested that we should

520
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:36,202
use this much more complex approach

521
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,406
to something that's kind of check.

522
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,040
Already got that.

523
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,410
Thanks, Brock. Ali.

524
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,162
I kind of feel that some of these

525
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:56,022
criticisms stems from the

526
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:59,682
fact from a serious lack of deep

527
00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:03,846
understanding of concepts related to

528
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,114
FEP and active inference. For example,

529
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:11,100
I came across a PhD thesis just today

530
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,586
in which it

531
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,234
tries to critique everything related

532
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:24,202
to Markup Blanket. But as I was glancing

533
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,120
over it,

534
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,686
I observed some serious gaps

535
00:31:31,818 --> 00:31:35,186
in our argument throughout all the

536
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,562
thesis. And I think materials such as

537
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:42,494
this book can definitely help in filling

538
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:45,622
up these gaps of understanding which

539
00:31:45,676 --> 00:31:49,538
even the serious researchers

540
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:51,160
are suffering from.

541
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,780
Yes, thanks. So to this

542
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,348
thread, I've never heard it about the

543
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,580
linear model. How could the linear model

544
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,500
be used in so many settings?

545
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,316
It explains nothing. Well, is the linear

546
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,424
model an explanation or is it an

547
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:20,036
investigative tool in the investigator's

548
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:23,412
toolbox? So at least

549
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,900
for me personally, doesn't need to have

550
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,096
broader reach than those who resonate

551
00:32:29,128 --> 00:32:32,590
with it. But again, I always try to ask,

552
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,084
would somebody say this or could they

553
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,496
say that about a linear model? And then

554
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:42,000
if the active formalism with f

555
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,996
equals dot dot dot dot dot or g equals

556
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,368
dot dot dot dot dot, and all of the

557
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:48,176
predicates that it's associated with and

558
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:50,804
the partition and all of that, could

559
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:53,252
someone say that about y equals MX plus

560
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:56,596
b? And then if not, and there may be

561
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:59,796
cases where it is not the same, what is

562
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:01,188
it that's different about active

563
00:33:01,204 --> 00:33:05,156
inference? Or is it a valid

564
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:06,980
and important and even reasonable

565
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,036
question, but one that might be bumping

566
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:12,216
up like what JF raised about

567
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:15,260
computational irreducibility or about

568
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,000
map territory even disguised

569
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,260
or camouflaged questions about

570
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,816
relationality? Well, how can complexity

571
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:25,920
science apply to so many topics?

572
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,344
We're applying complexity science to

573
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,464
whatever topic we want to. Where's the

574
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:33,090
issue?

575
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,296
Mike and then ron yeah, a lot.

576
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:42,196
Of it hinges on how the model is to be

577
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:44,900
applied and what the intent of model

578
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,456
application is. So taking the linear

579
00:33:47,488 --> 00:33:49,092
model as an example, we might use

580
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:51,876
something like that to be predictive

581
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,324
about a linear system. And so there's

582
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:57,832
potential value there. When we do system

583
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:00,936
dynamics models, a lot of times the

584
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,920
value in doing a system dynamics model

585
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,204
is aligning the stakeholders around

586
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:09,356
what are the model components and how do

587
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:11,304
we think about those model components.

588
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:13,420
So working through a process similar to

589
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,224
what we've done in this textbook group,

590
00:34:15,282 --> 00:34:18,930
although few do it as rigorously to

591
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,504
identify the system elements and how

592
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,216
they interact and interrelate and so

593
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:26,096
forth. And that can lead to more

594
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:27,972
advanced implementation like agent based

595
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:31,892
models. But a lot of times,

596
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,444
at least in my experience, those agent

597
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,672
based models are used for deeper systems

598
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:38,372
understanding more than, say,

599
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:41,076
predictive power for what the system is

600
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:43,096
going to do at some point in the future.

601
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:46,760
So again, it comes back to the reason

602
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,504
for applying the models and thinking

603
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:49,896
about how the model fits with that

604
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,616
reason and what sort of results you

605
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:55,596
would expect from that. Thank you.

606
00:34:55,618 --> 00:34:56,780
Mike? Ron?

607
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,404
Yeah, I generally agree with what

608
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:06,096
both you and Mike said. So from a

609
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:09,792
practitioner's perspective, we do hear

610
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,480
criticisms of linear models, right?

611
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,280
It's not that we don't, but it's usually

612
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,890
about which domain is applied in.

613
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,110
But generally speaking,

614
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,132
well, let me put it this way because

615
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:32,936
active inference is probably more

616
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:35,624
complex and it takes a lot more time to

617
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:38,232
crop than Y equals MX plus b, which

618
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:41,992
could be one reason for these kind of

619
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:45,528
criticisms. And it's probably like

620
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:47,332
they're falling back into old habits.

621
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,856
Okay, why should I jump my old model as

622
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:53,610
opposed to adopting this newer, more

623
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,976
the? How much more does it explain than

624
00:35:56,998 --> 00:36:00,364
what I think that probably is driving

625
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:01,680
a lot of the criticism.

626
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,090
Thank you.

627
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,556
I can't help but add a domain specific

628
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:15,684
example. This is a 2016 paper

629
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,820
that is speaking to like a multi decade

630
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,356
multi career brouhaha

631
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:27,476
about different approaches to modeling

632
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,960
evolution and selection. For example,

633
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,200
in the eusocial insects and in social

634
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,564
animals as well. And this article is

635
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:39,196
very fascinating because they use a

636
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:42,440
Bayesian causal graph to identify

637
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,020
situations where two different

638
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,716
formulations can and the multilevel

639
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,164
selection models have identical

640
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:54,540
predictions. Where the causal graphs

641
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,320
have identical predictions.

642
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,884
Any measurement you can think of as

643
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,056
being like on a Y equals x manifold

644
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,436
where it doesn't resolve your

645
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,276
uncertainty about which framework is

646
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:09,572
correct or not. Yet the literature is

647
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:12,760
littered with we measured these ovaries,

648
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,370
so kin selection is or isn't happening.

649
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,484
However, a vast set of those empirical

650
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:22,024
cases might be essentially falling on

651
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:25,564
this manifold where those two models are

652
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:29,836
not distinguishable. And so this

653
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:31,788
is a theory driven approach, like a

654
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:35,460
first principles approach to identify

655
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,744
situations that are

656
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:42,896
providing unique informative value. In

657
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:45,084
this case about canon multilevel

658
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:48,580
selection and knowing what territories

659
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,424
measurements will not have explanatory

660
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:52,070
value,

661
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,300
which relates to active inference.

662
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,984
Just like Rohan and like many people

663
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:03,816
have brought up, especially when we kind

664
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:05,816
of take like a meta science or like a

665
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:07,796
communicating science or onboarding

666
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,040
people into active concern,

667
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,156
people are asking explicitly or

668
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:15,996
implicitly why should I update my

669
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,476
cognitive model? What is the value of

670
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:22,636
active inference? Can you appetize me

671
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:25,288
with a two minute video so I can

672
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:28,796
understand it? Or with a two minute

673
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,008
video so it's enough to want to continue

674
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:32,560
going down that path?

675
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,478
There's a lot to say and there's a

676
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:46,014
lot of work to identify the

677
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:49,514
situations and the ways of truly

678
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:52,430
addressing and perhaps even resolving

679
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:57,022
long standing scientific

680
00:38:57,086 --> 00:39:00,546
divergences. Like, if it is the

681
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:03,570
case that the explore exploit dialectic

682
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,878
is addressed in a novel way through

683
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,682
the free energy functional balancing

684
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,670
pragmatic and epistemic reward,

685
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,454
that is quite

686
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:18,250
a vast scope.

687
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,936
People continue to use, explore and

688
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:26,248
exploit today and it is the evident that

689
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:29,364
those ontology terms wouldn't be useful

690
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:32,990
in the future. In fact, some of the

691
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,556
discussions on like folk psychology with

692
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,596
the belief, desires, intentions can we

693
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:41,912
say what an active inference entity

694
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:45,516
wants or intends based upon its beliefs

695
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,090
and its desires? For example,

696
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,096
can we still talk about exploratory and

697
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:56,372
exploitative behavior as a phenomena but

698
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:59,488
have a different way of modeling

699
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:02,710
how that behavior arises or is

700
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,580
regulated?

701
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,180
What are the settings in behavioral

702
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,640
cognitive science?

703
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,676
What are the settings where systems

704
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:20,796
dynamics has been applied where we

705
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,604
can now use active inference to

706
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:28,044
identify? Where have we

707
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:32,910
been just throwing a thousand darts at

708
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,480
the same grain of sand?

709
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,880
Where are the vast fields

710
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,470
where we don't even know?

711
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,682
And as people have highlighted, the book

712
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:57,518
is written with a specific rhetorical

713
00:40:57,694 --> 00:41:00,790
bent, both explicitly and implicitly.

714
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,238
For the regime of attention of the book

715
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:08,214
to be about active inference, one can

716
00:41:08,252 --> 00:41:10,614
read as an implicit endorsements that

717
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:12,986
this is something that is valid or

718
00:41:13,008 --> 00:41:14,970
valuable to pursue.

719
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,226
And especially at this stage in the

720
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:22,358
field, it is almost like an exhortation

721
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:26,670
to persist amidst uncertainty,

722
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:34,302
to learn and apply few

723
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:37,954
disjointed thoughts there but hope

724
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:38,900
it makes sense.

725
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,506
Let's look back to the sections of the

726
00:41:43,528 --> 00:41:44,100
book.

727
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,706
Anyone can raise their hand or give a

728
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:53,654
thought like how

729
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:57,640
could the book you write begin?

730
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,118
What reviewer comments? Whether you're

731
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,846
reviewer one, reviewer two, reviewer

732
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:08,234
three. What comments would you have

733
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:11,290
provided if this were, like, a draft?

734
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,470
And you could even make structural

735
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,450
suggestions.

736
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,614
So I have a lot of comments there. Yes.

737
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:30,400
Blue. And then Ron. Oh, sorry.

738
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,120
I didn't mean to cut you off.

739
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,666
Having taught lots of classes before,

740
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,314
I think a list of key

741
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:46,478
terms and definitions would be

742
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,178
critical. And learning objectives

743
00:42:50,274 --> 00:42:51,590
for each chapter,

744
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,350
like I said, like a practice quiz. Test

745
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,474
your knowledge of this. What is

746
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:02,278
surprise? Like, how many different forms

747
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:05,258
of surprise are there? Just some

748
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:07,526
practice questions to see if you grasped

749
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:10,090
the concepts prevented in each chapter

750
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,738
and especially what I was mentioning in

751
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:17,886
the chat like math problems can

752
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:19,920
you set up your own generative model?

753
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,126
Or even just the Bayesian graph? Can you

754
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,934
make a Bayesian graph? What would that

755
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:28,738
look like for give a question like a

756
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:30,978
verbal description and then give the

757
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,586
Bayesian graph answer or make the

758
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:35,266
answers available online so you could

759
00:43:35,288 --> 00:43:37,070
test your own knowledge of the subject

760
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,950
first. I think that that would be

761
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,198
totally instrumental in using this

762
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:44,790
functionally like a textbook anyway, so

763
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,674
sorry. Thanks Blue. Nice predictive

764
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:52,010
programming. Rohan and then Brock.

765
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,100
Yeah.

766
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,586
As a practitioner, I work in the

767
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:02,266
engineering field. I'm a control systems

768
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:05,694
engineer. My preference would be to

769
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:08,734
immediately see some application not

770
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,574
necessarily to control systems, but

771
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:14,046
something that it begins with like a

772
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,726
project and explains how active

773
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,170
inference is better than its own

774
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,386
baseline. That would be interesting to

775
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,794
see. Like a perfect example of this

776
00:44:23,832 --> 00:44:26,594
would be I don't know if you've heard of

777
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:29,906
Fast AI by Rachel Thomas and Jeremy

778
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:33,526
Howard. They have a very unique way of

779
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:34,310
teaching.

780
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,594
So they have a computational linear

781
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,598
algebra course. So the way they teach

782
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,010
the linear algebra part is by basically

783
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,066
implementing Gaussian loader, for

784
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:47,466
example, and then connecting it to so

785
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,146
you start with the code and then you do

786
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:50,698
the math, then you connect it to the

787
00:44:50,704 --> 00:44:54,074
math. So something like that might be

788
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,626
far more useful, maybe not from a

789
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:00,346
point, but it would definitely be useful

790
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:01,870
for practitioners around the world.

791
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,746
Okay, so if Controls engineer gets

792
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,730
this okay, this looks like a better form

793
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,046
model predictive control. I can replace

794
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:11,602
my model predictive controller with

795
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:13,838
something that resembles active

796
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:14,690
inference.

797
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,590
We might actually make more progress

798
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,440
that it actually gets out of the way.

799
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,950
Thank you, Ron Brock.

800
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,942
Yeah, I've had similar comments

801
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:35,260
to that. Of.

802
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,114
Fast AI and Benchmarks.

803
00:45:42,182 --> 00:45:46,062
That's kind of the ultimate way.

804
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:49,530
That's just the way that practitioners

805
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,320
change their attention now.

806
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,778
And that would be really useful. But in

807
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:58,546
the context of the book, I think

808
00:45:58,568 --> 00:46:00,226
I agree with everything else that was

809
00:46:00,248 --> 00:46:03,666
said too. I'm not sure how realistic it

810
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:07,220
is to do that from the point where

811
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,246
the whole field is at right now. Sorry

812
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:15,174
about that. But I

813
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:18,822
think just having some things in

814
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,394
context, there's always this comment

815
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:24,794
about it's a nonlinear thing. Text is

816
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:26,506
linear, so of course it will be out of

817
00:46:26,528 --> 00:46:30,730
out of order. But often

818
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,574
the definitions of things are kind

819
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:37,562
of scattered throughout the explanation

820
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:41,834
of them and kind of italicized

821
00:46:41,962 --> 00:46:44,480
instead of kind of brought up to the top

822
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,214
in some way.

823
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:53,300
You might expect, at least from my

824
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,234
pedagogical experience, everything like

825
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:01,098
all math is taught to define

826
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,866
your knowns and unknowns and variables

827
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:04,600
at the top and this sort of thing right

828
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,570
in the context of the appendices.

829
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,882
Again, I understand that

830
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,994
it's a lot, you can't add that all in

831
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:23,200
or whatever, but just if there was like

832
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,422
either every whenever the next

833
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,790
part of the appendices became relevant,

834
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,374
again, just like having it at the top at

835
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:35,178
each section you're like, okay, so we're

836
00:47:35,194 --> 00:47:38,098
going to use part now, building on what

837
00:47:38,104 --> 00:47:39,858
we've done already. Now we're going to

838
00:47:39,864 --> 00:47:42,338
use this part of this section in the

839
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:43,666
appendices. In this section our

840
00:47:43,688 --> 00:47:45,860
equation, one, two, three, whatever.

841
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,274
In this next section, like just stating

842
00:47:50,322 --> 00:47:54,246
it up front again, just like a

843
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:56,600
big box at the top or whatever,

844
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,046
it just would help in way finding

845
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,700
and disentangling the

846
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,926
unfortunate linear format

847
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,066
of books that is mapped to this complex

848
00:48:13,178 --> 00:48:13,840
thing.

849
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,806
I don't know, those general things would

850
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:22,014
be helpful. One other thing that is

851
00:48:22,052 --> 00:48:23,614
maybe beyond the scope of this book,

852
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:26,626
but spoke to Ali about very briefly at

853
00:48:26,648 --> 00:48:29,714
one point about the notation. Like even

854
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:33,060
in the basic example of the frog here,

855
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,730
like Bayesian notation,

856
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,874
it's incredibly easy to manipulate

857
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:42,294
variables when they're one letter and

858
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:45,314
subscripts, but. When the whole variable

859
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:50,250
is like ten or 20 letters, like p

860
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,220
of x equals frog jump condition on a y,

861
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,946
it becomes a larger I don't know if

862
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,906
this is just me and Dyslexic, I don't

863
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:03,934
know, but it just seems harder to

864
00:49:03,972 --> 00:49:07,200
cognitively kind of work with that.

865
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,556
I don't know. Thank you, Brock. Yes,

866
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:18,930
the chunking is multilevel and

867
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,890
it will be great to explore ways to

868
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,424
learn around that. Here are

869
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:30,608
a few forays where we can copy quotes

870
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:32,980
and have in line definitions.

871
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,524
So for those who are interested in this

872
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:38,996
kind of work with an

873
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:42,376
open source textbook, it is not an

874
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:45,124
infinite task or even a non automatable

875
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:49,480
task to copy out the plain text and

876
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,960
integrate it with a versioning ontology

877
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,172
so that the definition can be even

878
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:57,628
rendered differently. It could be in a

879
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:59,084
different language, it could be every

880
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,116
single time that a term comes up.

881
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:05,244
There's like so much enrichment that

882
00:50:05,362 --> 00:50:08,576
this seed can lead to of

883
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:13,056
the textbook and a

884
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:16,544
lot of it is for us to pick

885
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:20,436
up. Honestly. Rohan and

886
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,590
then anyone else?

887
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,988
Oh, I forgot to put down. Oh, no

888
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:29,270
worries. Thank you.

889
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,896
So in our last seven or so minutes for

890
00:50:35,918 --> 00:50:44,124
this session next

891
00:50:44,162 --> 00:50:46,860
week, we will continue with any

892
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,876
conceptual points and questions that

893
00:50:48,898 --> 00:50:52,350
people want to raise. We'll also be

894
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,330
turning our attention a bit more to

895
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,480
making sure first off that please,

896
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,524
please everyone complete the feedback

897
00:51:02,572 --> 00:51:05,504
form in the future textbook groups and

898
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:09,908
or add information here or contact

899
00:51:09,994 --> 00:51:12,564
us because it's just one of the most

900
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,870
important feedback mechanisms we have.

901
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,140
We'll also be exploring a little bit

902
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,440
different project ideas,

903
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,160
several of these threads involving

904
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,144
different system models we've already

905
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:34,648
found a home for in the Active

906
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:37,896
Blockprints project where we're

907
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:42,540
meeting twice on Wednesdays weekly.

908
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,984
Other projects we're going to have new

909
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:53,344
vistas on during and after going

910
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:55,280
through the second half of the textbook,

911
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,684
which is still black and white static

912
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:02,324
PDFs, but we'll be able to augment this

913
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:05,712
heavily with some simulation

914
00:52:05,776 --> 00:52:09,364
tools as well

915
00:52:09,402 --> 00:52:13,576
as other

916
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:17,012
work like the Plain Text Enrichment,

917
00:52:17,076 --> 00:52:19,444
or even anyone who wants to collaborate

918
00:52:19,492 --> 00:52:22,120
on an audiobook version.

919
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,272
There's no lack of active

920
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:32,252
tasks today and these

921
00:52:32,306 --> 00:52:37,548
are like high leverage point moments

922
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:39,724
where staying in the game and improving

923
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:42,400
the game will do tremendous service

924
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:45,344
towards reducing research debt and

925
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:47,996
improving the rigor in the applications

926
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:50,560
that we see. Rohan?

927
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:58,166
Yeah? Can I make a project suggestion?

928
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:00,940
That's fine. Yes please.

929
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,600
Everyone can? Yeah. Okay, so there is

930
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,046
put this in the chat. There's this

931
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:10,394
online lab by Georgia Tech's

932
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:12,734
Intelligence Systems unit called

933
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,126
Robotario that's basically a

934
00:53:16,148 --> 00:53:18,446
bunch of swarm. It's to test swarm

935
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:21,646
controllers. So there's

936
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:24,514
a good baseline over here. It would be a

937
00:53:24,552 --> 00:53:26,766
good idea to try like an active

938
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:29,506
inference version, like an active

939
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,774
inference inspired swarm controller to

940
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:36,706
finish the tasks. So this runs

941
00:53:36,738 --> 00:53:39,926
on actual robots in that lab and

942
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:41,510
you can see the results.

943
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,210
This is awesome. I had

944
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,746
some colleagues who worked with some

945
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:54,086
of the ant groups here. It's right at

946
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:58,586
the intersection of JF's

947
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:01,434
work and many's interest in the embodied

948
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:06,270
and robotic angle. And we have somewhat

949
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,086
extensive multi

950
00:54:11,118 --> 00:54:14,770
scale generative models of ants

951
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,406
which would apply to other swarm

952
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:23,160
settings as well. So absolutely we

953
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,014
want to scaffold those projects. And one

954
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:28,406
way to start, but not the only way to

955
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:31,506
start, is to copy a

956
00:54:31,548 --> 00:54:34,586
version of these fields and add and

957
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,380
remove as relevant for you and give some

958
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,414
handle for others to be

959
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:48,894
involved or just stay in the game so

960
00:54:48,932 --> 00:54:52,526
that more people can

961
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:54,670
join. There will be a flow of people

962
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,250
entering active inference forever.

963
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,626
How will we greet them? So what would I

964
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,420
need to put in over there?

965
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,010
It depends on how you want to carry

966
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,206
forward the project. But you can feel in

967
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:18,040
this row, add any notes you'd like and

968
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,174
more details on what you're thinking of

969
00:55:21,212 --> 00:55:23,818
doing. And then however you want to be

970
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:29,114
more specific about directions and

971
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:31,820
just signal it in the idea.

972
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,354
Or you can in the notes or draft

973
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:38,522
catechism, which is what these templates

974
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,320
are based on.

975
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,898
And if there is ever something you're

976
00:55:43,914 --> 00:55:48,066
not sure about, then ask around

977
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:51,380
and different projects are going to

978
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,370
proceed differently.

979
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:00,034
Okay. Yeah. So I'll fill that out with

980
00:56:00,072 --> 00:56:02,520
my talks. Awesome.

981
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:10,230
Well, interesting meeting.

982
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:14,234
It's our penultimate discussion in this

983
00:56:14,432 --> 00:56:18,058
section. Then we hope that

984
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:22,442
everybody who is motivated and ready

985
00:56:22,496 --> 00:56:26,446
to do so continues for

986
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:31,146
part two and or rejoins

987
00:56:31,258 --> 00:56:34,398
for part one, cohort two. Both of these

988
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:37,886
will be starting in September. So we'll

989
00:56:37,918 --> 00:56:41,250
take August off of the textbook.

990
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,810
And at this point, the tentative plan is

991
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,380
that we'll have two sequential hours,

992
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,618
like section one and then followed

993
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:57,062
by section two so that those who are on

994
00:56:57,116 --> 00:57:01,490
section one can see

995
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,700
how section two is.

996
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,102
We can explore different architectures

997
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:10,074
and stuff. And again, this is like why

998
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:12,314
people's active participation and their

999
00:57:12,352 --> 00:57:17,514
feedback and the oversharing on

1000
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:20,522
topic and just writing all the questions

1001
00:57:20,576 --> 00:57:21,818
that came in their mind and all the

1002
00:57:21,824 --> 00:57:22,922
things that they would want to ask

1003
00:57:22,976 --> 00:57:25,098
somebody to check. Like every

1004
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:28,754
contribution is important. It does

1005
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,866
anyone else have anything they'd like to

1006
00:57:30,888 --> 00:57:32,850
add before we stop the recording?

1007
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,794
Stopping the recording? Oh, yeah.

1008
00:57:46,832 --> 00:57:48,060
Someone go for it.

1009
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,310
All right. Stopping the recording.
