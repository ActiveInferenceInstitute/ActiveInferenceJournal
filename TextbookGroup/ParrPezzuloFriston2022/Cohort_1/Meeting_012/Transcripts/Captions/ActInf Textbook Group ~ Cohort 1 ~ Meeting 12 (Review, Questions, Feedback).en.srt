1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,560
hey everyone

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
welcome to week

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,000
12

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,839
of

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,440
octave textbook group cohort one

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
we are in the review and synthesis

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
weeks

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
it's been a great

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,560
three-month-ish

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
journey

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,519
and it doesn't stop here but we'll go

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
over that so

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,640
two

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,119
points of process for those who are here

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
live and of course re-watching

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,079
and then we'll move to the more

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,760
conceptual parts

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,120
so first

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,520
in the onboarding page

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,320
you'll see these two columns the two

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
columns are rsvping yes to join cohort

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,360
two part one going through chapters one

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
through five if you would like to for a

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,879
second time

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,600
many people will be just doing it

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
for fun or for learning or however they

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
want and also there's the opportunity to

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,680
continue on with the second half of the

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,799
textbook

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,040
which is going to get into a lot of the

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
hands-on modeling

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
and we'll be especially looking forward

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,759
to developing a lot of the notebooks and

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,080
interactive formats that'll help us get

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
a lot of understanding there

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
um so please check

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,960
yes

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,240
for whichever

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
row your name is in for whether you

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
would like to continue on with part two

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,479
as well as

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,400
retake uh part one as well

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
you'd be welcome to be just a

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,119
participant

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,520
and also feel free to get in touch if

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,479
you are interested in taking some other

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,079
roles such as like facilitating or

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,560
scaffolding some aspect but we can

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
talk more about that for those who are

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
interested so

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
point one go to the onboarding list and

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,439
continue on

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,079
however you want

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,479
second point um if you go to future

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,240
textbook groups page

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
you'll see an embedded form

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,318
as well as a link to the form if you

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,000
want it in a new window like that

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
this would be

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,720
exceptionally requested and helpful

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
for you to provide some evaluations

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
numerically and as short or as long as

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
you want

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
on providing feedback

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,720
those are

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,319
one way that you can provide feedback

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,599
anonymously

68
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
the second way

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
is uh building on some of the ideas that

70
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,560
people are already adding here this is

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
an editable page so people can

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
add thoughts

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
as they see fit about like what would be

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
awesome for future textbook groups

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
or any other feedback or as always they

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,239
can email active inference

77
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,800
activeinference.gmail.com if they want

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
like a response to any specific points

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
um and then also it's provided here at

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
the link to share for people who want to

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
join future cohorts so that link will be

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
like getting people

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
onboarded into the next cohort which is

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
september 2022 in this case but

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,519
this is going to be like an evergreen

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,480
form

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
that will just continue to have a list

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
of people who expressed interest and be

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
on boarding them into

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
subsequent cohorts of which will begin

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,120
several per year

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,760
going forward

93
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,000
any

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
uh and next week we'll be talking more

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
about the feedback

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
specifically

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
and about projects

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
and about carrying on

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760
today is like a little bit of a more

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
conceptual synthesis and review

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,959
and again next week will be more like

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
logistical

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
um and project oriented review so just

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,799
on these points or anything else

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,640
does anyone want to just raise their

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
hand or unmute and share anything that

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,839
they like

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,160
okay

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,680
let us

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
conceptually review

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,440
then

112
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,479
um

113
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,040
we read the first five chapters of the

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,759
active inference textbook

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
does anyone have overall thoughts that

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
they'd like to provide at the

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
five chapter scale

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
then we're going to go into a chapter

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
scale

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
then we'll be continuing to

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,440
dive in as um granularly as required

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,520
but at the scale of the first five

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
chapters you can see them here on this

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
preface page

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,880
as well as here in the chapters list

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,919
as a unit of five

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,120
chapters

128
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,639
what were people's sense

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
how did it update yes please ben

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
and then only

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
well i was just going to say i think um

132
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,199
you know as i've said to people before i

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,320
think

134
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
coming from a non-mathematics background

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,080
i thought that these chapters were

136
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,759
really accessible in terms of the kind

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,280
of conceptual

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
uh things that they were putting on the

139
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
table but i i just wondered what other

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
people's opinions were in terms of

141
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,479
um

142
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
you know

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,960
understanding the conceptual toolkit of

144
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
active inference

145
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
before you've built up a kind of

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,240
mathematical understanding

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,039
um because i'm about to start kind of um

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,639
learning some of the mathematics behind

149
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,960
it and i wondered what people thought of

150
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
like

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
the the potential to fully grasp these

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
concepts without the mathematics and

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
what the relationship between the two

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
might be i'm just curious what other

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,280
people think about that i guess

156
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,639
thanks great question um ali and then

157
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
mike and then anyone else who wants to

158
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,638
chime in

159
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
yeah it was a pretty exciting journey

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
for me uh but

161
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
i'll definitely need to

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,840
read over all those five chapters once

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,600
again at least once again uh in order to

164
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,479
grasp uh more fully uh the contents of

165
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,479
those chapters uh uh my own

166
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,120
personal opinion about uh

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
the way materials uh is organized in

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,960
these uh the first part of the textbook

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,759
is

170
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
uh

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
uh i couldn't see a kind of um

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,960
hierarchical or uh

173
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
i don't know structural uh

174
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,759
organization for these chapters as much

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,680
as i i like to see them because um

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
sometimes uh

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,759
they delve into a theoretical uh

178
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,639
theoretical aspect of all the things

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
much more deeply than the mathematical

180
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,440
side and sometimes it's vice versa

181
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
but

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,120
i i think that if it was

183
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
organized in a way that

184
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
as ben mentioned we can go from a

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
firm found a firm

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
conceptual foundation into

187
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
the granular formalism and mathematics

188
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
uh

189
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
at least for me that would be

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,120
much more uh accessible and much more uh

191
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,039
i would be able to organize the

192
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,440
materials in a coherent much more

193
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,240
coherent way in my mind so uh one thing

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
uh that um i really enjoyed about uh

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
these chapters is uh the

196
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
uh

197
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,639
kind of uh

198
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,759
uh

199
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,960
you see uh

200
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,980
a kind of uh the vision it uh

201
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,080
[Music]

202
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
tries to

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
put forward uh regarding the future uh

204
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,720
possible research uh and also uh things

205
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
especially in chapter five uh and the

206
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
the path that can be taken from this

207
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
point on

208
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,599
thank you

209
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,880
mike and then anyone else

210
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,039
yeah i'll pick up from where ali left

211
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
off i think it's

212
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,679
um

213
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
somewhat remarkable that they were able

214
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
to fit everything they did into those

215
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
first five chapters

216
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
and understanding

217
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
they probably had some

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
idea of how much space they wanted in

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
that part of the book before getting

220
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
into the the practical or applied

221
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
components in part two

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
you know the the high road low road

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
contrast and

224
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,640
um

225
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,959
sort of coming at the problem from

226
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
two different angles i think was useful

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
um

228
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
like ben i found the math to be

229
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,200
generally accessible although i confess

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,519
i i think i still go through this sort

231
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
of pattern where

232
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
i feel like i get it and i have this

233
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,720
intuitive understanding of it but then

234
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,399
there are things where

235
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,040
uh i sort of bog down and

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
looking at some of the mathematical

237
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
details or

238
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
some of the graphical representations um

239
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
related to things like message passing

240
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
um

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
have to slow down and

242
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
sort of take those apart more and

243
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,120
uh

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,600
i guess related to that i i should add i

245
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,399
think this group has been so good at

246
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,040
taking apart the ideas of the book this

247
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,560
is perhaps

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
one of the most effective settings i've

249
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
seen for

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
really

251
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:01,920
ringing

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,800
concepts out of a text and uh you know

253
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
the work that's going on with the coda

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
to build up the ontology and take apart

255
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
the equations and things like that i

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
think is is just tremendous

257
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,399
awesome thank you like

258
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,360
yeah it's um

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
you know the british call them maths

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
plural

261
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
instead of math as an area and it really

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
does engage

263
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,680
like

264
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,720
there's visual formalisms which could be

265
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
represented with a sparsity matrix or it

266
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,760
could be represented with other um

267
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,800
ways

268
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,920
but there there are um

269
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,839
almost like a multi-scale diversity of

270
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,640
formalisms ranging from more traditional

271
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,480
equal sign in the middle mathematics

272
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
to

273
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
fusion

274
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,680
schematic equation graphics

275
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
um

276
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,240
different types of notations even within

277
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
the equation

278
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,800
um

279
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
and the difficulty

280
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
is

281
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
not

282
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
signaled not that it has to be but the

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,959
difficulty

284
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,839
does

285
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
provide a little whiplash sometimes

286
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
because

287
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
it moves

288
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,959
variously in the main thread of the text

289
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
the boxes and the appendices

290
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
from like

291
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
this is how linear algebra works and

292
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
this is what bayes

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,000
theorem is

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,560
all the way to

295
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
topics that are approaching physics

296
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
flows on partitioned states

297
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
various kinds of fundamental or like in

298
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
principle relationships about

299
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
mathematics generally

300
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,160
all the way to

301
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,079
postulated

302
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
architectures

303
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,680
where message passing is implemented

304
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
to achieve some computational function

305
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
and or

306
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,279
thread the needle with resembling neural

307
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,240
computational architectures

308
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
the math is doing a lot

309
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
many things are happening and and so

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
it's um

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
only to be expected that the perception

312
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,519
is

313
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
challenging

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
and

315
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,279
there's probably a lot more to even

316
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,240
say

317
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
and um

318
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
unpack there

319
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,399
anyone else want to raise their hands

320
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,120
and

321
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,240
give a thought on this

322
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,440
section one area

323
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
jf and then anyone else

324
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
have kind of a general question about

325
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
the limits

326
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,360
of mathematics

327
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
the notion of computational

328
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
irreducibility

329
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
uh

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,680
that

331
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
you have to

332
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,560
go through every step of a process

333
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,600
to get at state and plus 1 from

334
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,440
state and from state and minus whatever

335
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,040
that

336
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
certain problems cannot be

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
solved

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,040
by plugging values into a formula and

339
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,399
generating

340
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
a future state you have to compute all

341
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,360
the intermediate states

342
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
i wonder

343
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
where that

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
fits in in this picture

345
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
are there hard limits to the application

346
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
of of of mathematics

347
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,399
um to to to the problem of active

348
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,079
inference it's just a general question

349
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,880
returning to some um earlier

350
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
comments on

351
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
the firm conceptual ground

352
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,399
what

353
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,880
is an area no matter how

354
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,440
narrow or distal from actin where people

355
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,040
believe that

356
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,120
there is

357
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
a firm conceptual ground they felt like

358
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,440
that provided a foundation for them to

359
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
learn further

360
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,639
are we seeking an analogy

361
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,800
to some other

362
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,480
field of theory or practice or domain

363
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
or are we kind of seeking for a

364
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
epistemic

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,199
territory that we haven't quite

366
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
scene

367
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,680
i'll

368
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,560
just add i think that what in active

369
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
inference what you're talking about

370
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,880
there jeff is literally blankets

371
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
and uncertainty

372
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,199
like the corollary there of like

373
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
computational irreducibility

374
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
is that there's some large amount of

375
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
uncertainty in states in the world that

376
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
you're just never going to get at

377
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
the blanket is in some sense

378
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,959
not just

379
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,920
how you're relating to it

380
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
but some

381
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,800
hard

382
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
limit on your

383
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
you know your surprisal and

384
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,758
things like that so

385
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,519
thanks

386
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,680
uh brock had written oh yes mike please

387
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
uh so responding to the question about

388
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
maybe adjacent spacex or spaces or topic

389
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,839
areas

390
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,199
uh i think there's certainly overlap

391
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,240
with

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
concepts from system dynamics and

393
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,160
certainly a lot of agent-based modeling

394
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
has been applied

395
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,240
uh

396
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
to model systems that have feedback

397
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,880
loops and

398
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
adaptation things like that

399
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,519
we discussed

400
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,680
during the the past weeks relationships

401
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
with reinforcement learning and

402
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,959
um

403
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,560
i think there's

404
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,959
a belief that active inference kind of

405
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,360
cleans up some of the challenging

406
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
or maybe not challenging but uh

407
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,959
less formalized or less defined aspects

408
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,360
related to reinforcement learning

409
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,000
such as uh how do you engineer a utility

410
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
function that makes sense in the context

411
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,839
of what you're trying to model

412
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,799
banks agreed about creating a uh

413
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,319
integrated utility function

414
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,400
there's so many

415
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,359
unprincipled not to say ineffective or

416
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
not even to say not elegant but

417
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,039
unprincipled methods of creating

418
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,160
a chimera utility model

419
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,039
like

420
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
delay discounting

421
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,440
novelty bonus curiosity bonuses

422
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
alternating phases

423
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,919
or hyper parameters

424
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,960
that

425
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,520
um as well as purely implementational

426
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
strategies like

427
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,960
discarding burn in

428
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,760
parallel chains there's like

429
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
a whole toolkit and indeed fields

430
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
on creating

431
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
effectively

432
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,600
integrated utility models

433
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
and

434
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
putting that work

435
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,840
into the construction of the generative

436
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,679
model

437
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,200
and how the generative model is

438
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,960
partitioned from the generative process

439
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,240
allows

440
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,440
a generic free energy functional or set

441
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,120
of related free energy formulations

442
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,479
to play that role

443
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,799
so that's one very interesting angle

444
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,400
as well as

445
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
the way that that process of specifying

446
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
the generative model and generative

447
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,360
processes and so on

448
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,559
are

449
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
world models

450
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,200
whether

451
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
in the john le

452
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,559
sense

453
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,320
or in the atom saffron sense

454
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,559
these generative models encompass world

455
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
models and deep learning approaches and

456
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,280
various

457
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
topics like

458
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,600
that um

459
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,400
so

460
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,760
let's see

461
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
blue

462
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
wrote i wish there was practice problems

463
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,640
in the book to develop our understanding

464
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,520
yes

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,880
um

466
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
to a large extent and also it's whether

467
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,000
people want to reflect on any specific

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,160
questions or even just on this

469
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,120
um

470
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,799
scheme

471
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,400
these are many of these questions

472
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
these questions can be

473
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,240
um

474
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
open

475
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,919
infinite game type questions

476
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
about the material

477
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,240
they can be clearly addressable

478
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
questions about the material

479
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
they can be

480
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
um

481
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
checks for understanding

482
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,360
but we'll be continuing to develop and

483
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
improve and

484
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,039
curate questions around the material

485
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,930
so i

486
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,120
[Music]

487
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,039
think it's a great comment

488
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
and

489
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
this is why we have this future textbook

490
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,480
groups

491
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
and all of these affordances for people

492
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
to stay involved and and be improving

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,720
this as well as experimenting in their

494
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,600
own

495
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
spaces and ways

496
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
to to develop the kinds of material that

497
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
are helping them

498
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,360
learn and understand

499
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
any more section one

500
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,559
overview thoughts

501
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,320
chapters one through five

502
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,240
and the framing of the book

503
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
being that the first five chapters are

504
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
more focused on the conceptual

505
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
background

506
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,880
and the second five chapters

507
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,559
are going to be

508
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,320
starting with a recipe for designing the

509
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,480
active models and and getting more into

510
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
the modeling itself

511
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
so any

512
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,440
section one through five

513
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
commentary

514
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
the book comprises two parts page three

515
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
these are aimed at readers who want to

516
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,679
understand active inference

517
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,039
first part

518
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,720
and those who seek to use it for their

519
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
own research second part

520
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,360
the first part of the book introduces

521
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,960
active inference

522
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,039
both conceptually and formally

523
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,559
contextualizing it within current

524
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,600
theories of cognition

525
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,440
how

526
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080
did they succeed

527
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
and where was there a divergence between

528
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
what you

529
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
preferred

530
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,480
a priori or now

531
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
comprehensive formal and self-contained

532
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
introduction to active inference

533
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
its main constructs and implications for

534
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,960
the study of brain and cognition

535
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,120
i'm uh i'm interested in the distinction

536
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
between uh

537
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,440
understanding active inference and using

538
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,480
it

539
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,799
for our own research

540
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,559
and the way that that's set up as those

541
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,360
being two completely separate things

542
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,600
um

543
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
it seems to suggest that one could fully

544
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
understand active inference and yet not

545
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,080
be in a position to use it in their own

546
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,440
research

547
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
not having worked through the second

548
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,919
half of the book and i think that's

549
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
quite interesting

550
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,240
it is

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
good comment thank you

552
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:08,810
um

553

[Music]

554
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,919
not to uh spoil the ending

555
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,679
but the last sentence is ultimately we

556
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,360
are confident that you will continue to

557
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,959
pursue active inference in some form

558
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,080
there may be a multi-year

559
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,919
incubation

560
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,360
for different people and contexts

561
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,280
many people

562
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
now or even in some

563
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,000
amazing decentralized science future

564
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
they may not think of themselves as

565
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,760
researchers or of doing research

566
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,640
though they may be even included on

567
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,799
research projects

568
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,679
um

569
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,000
so it's it's very interesting uh

570
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,919
comments

571
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,039
about

572
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
how they

573
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,159
distinguish like

574
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,480
theory and learning

575
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,860
from

[Music]

577
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
part two

578
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,279
research and practice

579
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
however

580
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,530
um

581
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,880
[Music]

582
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
they

583
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,840
discuss applications

584
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,520
but this isn't

585
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
the playbook it's not the toolkit

586
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,679
it's not the modeling tool ecosystem

587
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,000
mike

588
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
yeah that's an interesting comment at

589
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,640
the end

590
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
and

591
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
i know this is my perceptual bias but

592
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,360
there seems to be this implicit

593
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,279
assumption that

594
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,360
active inference is the way to go

595
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
basically this is the tool to use

596
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
within the text

597
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
and

598
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,039
so as a result what's not there is a

599
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,799
discussion of

600
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,880
uh maybe these are cases where you might

601
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,279
not want to use active inference or

602
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,120
these are cases where applying active

603
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,919
entrance could create challenges in what

604
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,799
you're solving for

605
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,719
ali and anyone else

606
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
and in fact one of the uh most popular

607
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
criticisms puts toward the active

608
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,720
inference or fep in general is that

609
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
it tries to explain everything

610
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,159
it ends up explaining nothing

611
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,400
so

612
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
yeah i think there's a risk of

613
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,360
maybe

614
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,039
not sufficiently constraining the

615
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,760
problem space or

616
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,559
leaving things undefined in a way that

617
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,600
uh

618
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,960
allow for

619
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
active interest to be the solution

620
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,240
without a critical point of view

621
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
they

622
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,640
highlight

623
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,039
behavior and cognition i mean one could

624
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
almost see even

625
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,200
the name active inference as being

626
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,559
a synthesis

627
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,600
of

628
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,559
action

629
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,760
behavior

630
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
and cognition

631
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,720
inference

632
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
in ways that as we're

633
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,159
discovering and and unpacking

634
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,000
they're integrated in ways that other

635
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,480
formalisms of

636
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,720
perception as a type of cognition so we

637
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
can just lump it there

638
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,799
other frameworks of behavior and

639
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,440

from a

non-first principles

644
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
or maybe they do follow first principles

645
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,279
like the higher the impact factor the

646
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,480
better the paper

647
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
something like that that's the first

648
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
principle

649
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,919
um

no just kidding um

651
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,279
but

652
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,720
placing it within the framework of

653
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
cognition

654
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,360

of

657
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,240
something like pan cognitivism or like

expand the scope

and that's even before

663
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,600
one starts to enter into the more recent

664
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
research

665
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
especially

666
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,520
where there is a highlight on system

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,600
persistence

668
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,320
not simply in terms of the resistance to

669
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,600

670
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,279
entropically

671

but in a relational context as repeated

672
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
measurements like in the quantum work

673
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,840
so

674
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
it's like

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,039
cognition oh like brains like that

676
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,960
schema with a brain or with like a

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,200
well oh by cognition

i

688
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
kind of want to i guess echo all those

689
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,840
things that were just said about the

690

common criticism and this

691
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
where does it apply where does it not

692
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,279
apply but

693
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,000
also i guess

694
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
um all those things that you were just

695
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
listing like i i wonder

696
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,679
i always hear that from people that have

697
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,320
not um

698
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,720
engaged with the material

699
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,159
um

700
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,000
and from

701
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,039
my engagement with it it seems like

702
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
all of the examples in which it is used

703
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,480
it are

704
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
um

705
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,640
complex dynamical systems that don't

706
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,840
have great that have at best

707
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,120
mathematical approximations and have

708
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,679
almost no or literally no kind of

709
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,039
analytical

710
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,840
approaches

711
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
it just seems like a good way to model a

712
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,919
system of things of entities that are

713
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
interacting

714
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
um

715
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,480
and i don't i i guess what i'm

716
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
to to put it into like one question like

717
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,000
what is uh is that kind of some

718
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,559
anthropomorphizing

719
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,640
or whatever projecting

720
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,679
of like

721
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,360
well it's applied to this it's applied

722
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
to that

723
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,880
it must apply to everything and um you

724
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,159
know how can it apply to all those

725
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,600
things how can it apply everywhere it's

726
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
like it's not applying to everywhere

727
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
it's just applying to these

728
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
complex systems which are

729
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
everywhere

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,399
but also don't have and you know we're

731
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,000
not trying to model the apple falling

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,279
from the tree or the hyper you know the

733
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,120
these sorts of simple cases or something

734
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,200
it's not being applied there

735
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,279
i mean is it i don't i haven't seen

736
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,120
actually you know now that i think about

737
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
it any

738
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,559
of those sorts of situations or it's

739
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,840
applied

740
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,240
to things that we already understand in

741
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,480
this like maybe in some back-checking

742
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,320
way but not in a like way that's

743
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,480
suggested that we should use this much

744
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
more complex

745
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
you know approach to something that's

746
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
kind of

747
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,279
check already got that

748
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,240
you know

749
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,559
um

750
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,399
thanks brock um

751
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,000
ali i kind of feel that uh some of these

752
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
criticisms uh

753
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,279
stems from some from the fact from a

754
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,399
serious

755
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,080
a lack of deep understanding of uh

756
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,039
concepts related to fap and active

757
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,080
inference

758
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,880
for example uh i came across

759
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,360
a phd thesis just today

760
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,039
uh

761
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,440
in which

762
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,840
it tries to

763
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,120
critique

764
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
everything related to mark of blanket

765
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,200
but

766
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,159
as i was glancing over it uh

767
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,039
i

768
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,080
i observed some serious

769
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,519
uh gaps uh in our argument throughout

770
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,240
all and all the whole the thesis and

771
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,360
i think uh materials such as this book

772
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
uh can definitely help in filling up

773
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
these gaps of understanding

774
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
which even

775
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
the

776
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
the serious researchers

777
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,559
are suffering from

778
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,159
yes thanks

779
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,960
so to um

780
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,080
this thread

781
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,519
i've never heard it about the linear

782
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
model

783
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,200
how could the linear model be used in so

784
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,919
many settings

785
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
it explains nothing

786
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,519
well is the linear model an explanation

787
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,799
or is it an investigative tool

788
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,000
in the investigators toolbox

789
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
so

790
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,960
at least for me personally doesn't need

791
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
to have

792
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,480
broader reach than those who

793
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
resonate with it but

794
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,200
again i always try to ask

795
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
would somebody say this or could they

796
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,760
say that about a linear model

797
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,799
and then if the actin formalism

798
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,600
with

799
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,880
f equals

800
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
dot or g equals

801
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
dot

802
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,039
and all of the predicates that it's

803
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,880
associated with and the partition and

804
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
all of that

805
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
could someone say that about y equals mx

806
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,640
plus b

807
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,799
and then if not and there may be cases

808
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,279
where it is not the same

809
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,039
what is it that's different about active

810
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,159
inference

811
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,279
or

812
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,159
is it

813
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,320
a valid and important and even

814
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,000
reasonable question

815
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,399
but one that might be bumping up like

816
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,880
what jf raised about computational

817
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
irreducibility

818
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,279
or about map territory

819
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,159
even

820
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,120
disguised or camouflaged questions about

821
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,559
relationality

822
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
well how can complexity science apply to

823
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,360
so many topics

824
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
we're applying complexity science to

825
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,760
whatever topic we want to

826
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,640
where's the issue

827
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,640
mike and then ron

828
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,960
yeah a lot of it hinges on

829
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,039
how the model is to be applied and what

830
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,480
the intent of

831
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,640
model application is so

832
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,480
taking the linear model as an example we

833
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,640
might use something like that

834
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,279
to be predictive about a linear system

835
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,240
and so there's potential value there

836
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,840
uh when we do system dynamics models

837
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,600
a lot of times the value in doing a

838
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,559
system dynamics model is aligning the

839
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,399
stakeholders around

840
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,199
what are the model components and how do

841
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,679
we think about those model components so

842
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,119
working through a process similar to

843
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
like what we've done in this textbook

844
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,159
group although few do it as rigorously

845
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,440
to

846
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,359
identify the system elements and how

847
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,119
they interact and interrelate and so

848
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,839
forth and and that can lead to

849
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,199
more advanced implementation like

850
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,719
agent-based models

851
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,399
um

852
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,560
but a lot of times at least in my

853
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,159
experience those agent-based models are

854
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,679
used for

855
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
deeper systems understanding more than

856
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
say predictive power for

857
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,079
what the system is going to do at some

858
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,000
point in the future so

859
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,839
again it comes back to the

860
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,159
the reason for applying the models and

861
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,520
thinking about how the model fits with

862
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,399
that reason and what sort of results you

863
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,119
would expect from that

864
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,240
thank you mike ron

865
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,040
uh yeah i i generally agree with

866
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,280
what you and mike said

867
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,839
so from a practitioner's perspective

868
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,800
uh

869
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
i mean we do hear criticisms of

870
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
linear models right it's not that we

871
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
don't

872
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
but it's usually about which domain is

873
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
being applied in

874
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
uh

875
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
yeah uh

876
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,879
but generally speaking

877
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,680
well uh let me close this with uh

878
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,079
because active inference is probably

879
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,119
more

880
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,440
complex and it takes a lot more time to

881
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,400
drop than y equals mx plus b which could

882
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,680
be

883
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
one reason for these kind of

884
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,040
criticisms and it's probably

885
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
like that they're falling back into old

886
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,119
habits okay why should i jump my old

887
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,480
model

888
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,400
as opposed to adopting this newer more

889
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
uh

890
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
well how much more does it explain than

891
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,079
what i hope

892
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,200
i think that

893
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
probably is driving a lot of the

894
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
criticism

895
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,439
of these things

896
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,480
thank you

897
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,520
i can't help but add a domain specific

898
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
example

899
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,839
um this is a 2016 paper

900
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,359
that is speaking to like a multi-decade

901
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,359
multi-career

902
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,480
brouhaha

903
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,440
about

904
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,520
different approaches to modeling

905
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,280
evolution and selection

906
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,520
for example in the eu social insects and

907
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,000
in social animals as well

908
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,640
and this article is very fascinating

909
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
because

910
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,520
they use a bayesian causal graph

911
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
to identify situations where

912
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,359
two different formulations

913
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,040
the kin and the multi-level selection

914
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,240
models

915
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,800
have identical predictions

916
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,280
where the causal graphs have identical

917
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,839
predictions

918
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,839
any measurement

919
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,839
you can think of as being like on a y

920
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,680
equals x manifold where it doesn't

921
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,440
resolve your uncertainty about which

922
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
framework is correct or not

923
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,119
yet the literature is littered with we

924
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,119
measured these ovaries

925
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,839
so can selection is or isn't happening

926
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,400
however a vast set of those empirical

927
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,680
cases

928
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,800
might be

929
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,599
essentially falling on this manifold

930
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,680
where those two models are not

931
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
distinguishable

932
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,520
and so

933
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,599
this is a theory driven approach like a

934
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,400
first principles approach

935
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,760
to identify situations

936
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,960
that

937
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,920
are

938
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,640
providing unique informative value

939
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
in this case about

940
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,480
canon multi-level selection

941
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,440
and knowing what territories

942
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
measurements will not have explanatory

943
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
value

944
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,599
which

945
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,480
relates to active inference um

946
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,880
just like rohan and like many people

947
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,520
have brought up especially when we

948
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
kind of take like a meta science or like

949
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,599
a communicating science or onboarding

950
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,720
people into active concern

951
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,280
like people are asking

952
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,359
explicitly or implicitly why should i

953
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,359
update my cognitive model

954
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,160
what is the value of active inference

955
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,200
can you

956
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
appetize me

957
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,640
with a two minute video

958
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
so i can understand it

959
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
or with a two minute video so it's

960
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
enough to want to continue going down

961
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,839
that path

962
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,580
there's a lot to say and there's um

963
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,240
[Music]

964
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
a lot of work

965
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,680
to identify

966
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,599
the situations

967
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,560
and the ways of truly addressing and

968
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,110
perhaps even resolving

969
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,280
[Music]

970
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,250
long-standing

971
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,320
[Music]

972
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,640
scientific divergences

973
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,680
like

974
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,760
if it is the case that the explore

975
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
exploit dialectic

976
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,359
is addressed in a novel way

977
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,040
through the free energy functional

978
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,200
balancing pragmatic and epistemic reward

979
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,839
that is

980
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,680
quite a vast scope

981
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,720
people continue to use explore and

982
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
exploit today

983
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
and it is the evident that that those

984
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,440
ontology terms wouldn't be useful in the

985
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,800
future

986
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,839
in fact

987
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,040
some of the

988
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,480
um

989
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,320
discussions on like folk psychology with

990
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,119
the belief desires intentions

991
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
can we say what an active inference

992
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,359
entity wants

993
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,440
or intends based upon its beliefs and

994
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,720
its desires for example

995
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,920
can we still talk about exploratory and

996
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,160
exploitative behavior

997
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,240
as a phenomena but have a different way

998
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,760
of modeling how that behavior arises or

999
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,520
or is

1000
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,160
regulated

1001
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,359
what are the settings in

1002
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,200
behavioral cognitive science

1003
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,000
what are the settings in

1004
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,160
where systems dynamics has been applied

1005
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,839
where we can now use active

1006
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,119
inference to identify

1007
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,200
where have we been just

1008
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,160
throwing a thousand darts

1009
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,399
at

1010
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,200
the same

1011
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,359
grain of sand

1012
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,760
where are the vast

1013
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,079
fields

1014
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,920
where we don't even know

1015
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,599
and as people have highlighted the book

1016
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,599
is written

1017
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,760
with a specific rhetorical

1018
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
bent both explicitly and implicitly

1019
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,040
um

1020
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,200
for the regime of attention of the book

1021
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,599
to be about active inference

1022
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,240
one can read as an implicit endorsements

1023
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,319
that this is something that is

1024
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,319
valid or valuable to pursue

1025
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,359
and

1026
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,920
especially at this stage in the field it

1027
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,560
is almost like an exhortation

1028
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
to

1029
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,839
persist amidst uncertainty

1030
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,040
to learn and apply

1031
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,440
few disjointed thoughts there but

1032
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,480
i hope it makes sense

1033
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
let's look back to the subjections of

1034
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,520
the book

1035
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,480
anyone can raise their hand or give a

1036
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,119
thought like

1037
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,920
how

1038
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,119
could

1039
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,960
the book you write

1040
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,359
begin

1041
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,520
what reviewer comments

1042
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,200
whether you're reviewer one reviewer two

1043
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,880
reviewer three

1044
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,800
what comments would you have provided if

1045
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,160
this were like

1046
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,560
a draft

1047
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,400
and you could even make structural

1048
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,400
suggestions

1049
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
so i have a lot of comments there

1050
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,400
yes blue and then ron

1051
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,480
um i uh

1052
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
so like

1053
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
having taught

1054
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,680
lots of classes before like i think um

1055
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,440
a list of like key terms and definitions

1056
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,160
would be like critical i mean i mean and

1057
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,960
like

1058
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,240
learning objectives for each chapter

1059
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,760
um

1060
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,960
like i said uh like a practice quiz like

1061
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,599
test your knowledge of this like like

1062
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,839
what is surprise like how many different

1063
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,680
forms of surprise are there you know i

1064
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
mean like like just some practice

1065
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,760
questions to see if you grasped the

1066
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,160
concepts prevented in each chapter

1067
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,040
um

1068
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,119
and especially like uh what i was

1069
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,440
mentioning in the chat like math

1070
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,160
problems like practice like can you set

1071
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,319
up your own generative model um like

1072
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,480
like what would the like or even just

1073
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,240
the bayesian graph like can you make a

1074
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,000
bayesian graph like what would that look

1075
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,319
like for you know give a give a question

1076
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
like a verbal description and then

1077
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,880
give the bayesian graph like answer or

1078
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,640
like make the answers available online

1079
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,319
so you could test your own knowledge of

1080
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,280
the subject first um i think that that

1081
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,359
would be like totally instrumental in in

1082
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,680
using this functionally like a textbook

1083
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,880
anyway so sorry

1084
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,160
thanks blue nice predictive programming

1085
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,839
rohan and then

1086
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,720
brock uh yeah uh so

1087
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,839
my

1088
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,839
as a practitioner right i

1089
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,359
work in the engineering field i'm a

1090
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,920
control systems engineer

1091
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,160
my preference would be to immediately

1092
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,400
see some application

1093
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,560
not necessarily to control systems but

1094
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,520
something that it begins with

1095
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,599
like a project and explains how active

1096
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,119
inference is better than its own

1097
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,480
baseline

1098
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,520
that would be

1099
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,200
interesting to see

1100
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,839
uh like a perfect example of this would

1101
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:24,880
be

1102
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,240
i don't know if you've heard of fastai

1103
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,960
by rachel thomas and jeremy howard they

1104
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,800
have a very unique way of teaching

1105
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,880
uh

1106
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,480
so they have a computational linear

1107
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,800
algebra course so the way they teach the

1108
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
linear algebra part is by basically

1109
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,359
implementing gaussian blur for example

1110
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,200
and then connecting it to

1111
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,880
so you start with the code and then you

1112
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,560
do the math then you connect it to the

1113
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,599
math

1114
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,200
so something like that

1115
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,599
might be far more useful

1116
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,760
uh maybe not from a

1117
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
point but it would

1118
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
definitely be useful for practitioners

1119
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,359
around the world okay so this

1120
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,599
so if you know controls engineer gets

1121
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,680
this okay this looks like a better form

1122
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,839
model predictive control i can replace

1123
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,440
my model predictive controller with

1124
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,400
something

1125
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,880
that resembles active inference

1126
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,680
it might actually make uh

1127
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,400
we might actually make more progress

1128
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,920
that it actually gets out of the way

1129
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,400
thank you ron brock

1130
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,160
um

1131
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,800
yeah i i think i mean i've had

1132
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,960
similar comments to that of um

1133
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,640
you know

1134
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,119
fast ai and

1135
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,200
benchmarks that that's kind of the

1136
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,440
ultimate

1137
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,560
way that's just the way that um

1138
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,520
practitioners change their um attention

1139
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,319
now

1140
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,240
um and that would be really useful but

1141
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,560
in in the context of the book

1142
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,079
um

1143
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,680
i think i agree with every everything

1144
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,000
else that was said too uh

1145
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,920
i'm not sure how realistic it is to do

1146
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,200
that from

1147
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,839
the point you know where

1148
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:08,960
the whole

1149
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,880
field is at right now sorry about that

1150
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,760
um

1151
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
but

1152
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,800
you know

1153
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,160
i think

1154
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,440
just having some some things in context

1155
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,599
like there's always this comment about

1156
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,400
like

1157
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,480
you know it's a non-linear thing a text

1158
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,400
is linear so of course it'll be out of

1159
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,680
out of order

1160
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,240
but like um

1161
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,160
often the definitions of things are

1162
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
kind of scattered throughout the

1163
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,800
explanation of them

1164
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,599
and

1165
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,720
kind of

1166
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,359
italicize instead of kind of brought up

1167
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,359
to the top you know

1168
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,359
in some

1169
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,880
um

1170
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
way you might expect

1171
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,920
that i at least from my

1172
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,800
my

1173
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,119
pedagogical experience everything like

1174
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,319
all math is

1175
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,079
taught to you know

1176
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,240
like to define your knowns and unknowns

1177
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,599
and variables at the top and the sort of

1178
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,640
thing right um

1179
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,480
the in the

1180
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,119
context of like the appendices

1181
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,480
um

1182
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,400
again there's like

1183
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
i understand that

1184
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,880
it's a lot you can't you know do you

1185
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,800
can't add that all in or whatever but

1186
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,760
just

1187
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,520
if there was like

1188
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,400
um either every whenever

1189
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
the next part of the appendice became

1190
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,839
relevant

1191
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,400
you know um again just like having it at

1192
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,079
the top like at each section you're like

1193
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,559
okay so we're gonna use part you know

1194
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,319
now building on you know what we've done

1195
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,319
already like now we're going to use this

1196
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,160
part of this this section in the

1197
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,319
appendices in this section our equation

1198
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,079
one two three whatever

1199
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,040
in

1200
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
in in this next section like just

1201
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,319
stating it up front

1202
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,480
again just like a like a you know

1203
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,800
big box on the top or whatever

1204
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,599
um

1205
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,960
it just

1206
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,839
would help like in wayfinding and

1207
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,920
disentangling

1208
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
the

1209
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,359
unfortunate linear um

1210
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,960
format of books

1211
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,359
that is mapped to this complex thing um

1212
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,080
and so

1213
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,440
[Music]

1214
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,280
yeah i don't know those those general

1215
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,440
things would be helpful one other thing

1216
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,200
that is maybe beyond the scope of this

1217
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,160
book but

1218
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,480
um spoke to ellie about very briefly at

1219
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,119
one point about the notation

1220
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,839
like even in the basic example of the

1221
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,440
frog here

1222
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,240
um like bayesian notation

1223
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,359
it's um

1224
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,680
it's incredibly easy to manipulate

1225
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,359
variables when they're

1226
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,599
one letter and subscripts

1227
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,240
but when the whole variable is like 10

1228
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,559
or 20 letters like

1229
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,480
you know frog p p of x equals frog jump

1230
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,880
you know condition on a y it's like it

1231
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
becomes a larger

1232
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,400
i don't i don't know if this is just me

1233
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,880
and dyslexic you know like i don't know

1234
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,760
but um it just seems harder to

1235
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,599
cognitively kind of

1236
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,359
um work with that

1237
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,598
um

1238
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
i don't know thank you brock

1239
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,160
yes the chunking is multi-level

1240
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,800
and there it will be great to explore

1241
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,280
ways to um

1242
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,079
learn around that

1243
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,119
here

1244
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,240
are a few

1245
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
forays where we can copy quotes and have

1246
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,599
inline definitions

1247
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,359
so for those who are interested in this

1248
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,720
kind of

1249
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,480
work

1250
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,520
with an open source textbook

1251
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,079
it is not an infinite task or even a

1252
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,920
non-automatable task

1253
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,119
to copy out the plain text

1254
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,960
and integrate it with a versioning

1255
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,319
ontology

1256
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,160
so that the definition

1257
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,839
can be like

1258
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,359
even rendered differently it could be in

1259
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,880
a different language it could be every

1260
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,280
single time that a term comes up

1261
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,720
there's like

1262
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,640
so much enrichment

1263
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,880
that this seed

1264
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,319
can lead to

1265
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,240
of the textbook

1266
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,800
and

1267
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,839
a lot of it is for

1268
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,280
us to pick up

1269
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,599
honestly

1270
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,960
rohan and then anyone else

1271
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,520
oh i i forgot to put down

1272
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,640
oh no worries thank you

1273
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,839
so in our um

1274
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,079
last seven or so minutes for this

1275
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,079
session

1276
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,040
next week

1277
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
we will continue with any

1278
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,720
conceptual points and questions that

1279
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,800
people want to raise

1280
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,720
we'll also be

1281
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,559
turning our attention

1282
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,559
a bit more

1283
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,160
to

1284
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,319
uh making sure first off that please

1285
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,480
please everyone complete the feedback

1286
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,680
form

1287
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,880
in the future textbook groups and or

1288
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,160
add information here or um contact us

1289
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,440
because

1290
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,880
it's just one of the most important

1291
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,079
feedback mechanisms we have

1292
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,200
we'll also be exploring a little bit

1293
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,400
different

1294
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,359
project

1295
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,880
ideas

1296
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,920
um

1297
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,920
several of these threads involving

1298
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,160
different system models

1299
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
we've already found

1300
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,680
a home for

1301
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,960
in the active block prints project

1302
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,000
where we're

1303
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,839
meeting

1304
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,920
twice on wednesdays weekly

1305
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,520
other

1306
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,720
projects

1307
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,240
we're going to have new vistas on during

1308
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,960
and after

1309
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,240
going through the second half of the

1310
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,599
textbook

1311
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,559
which

1312
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,079
is uh still black and white static pdfs

1313
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,160
but we'll be able to augment this

1314
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,520
heavily

1315
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,040
with some

1316
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,000
simulation tools

1317
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,520
as well as

1318
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,760
other

1319
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,280
work like

1320
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,160
the plain text enrichment or even anyone

1321
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,200
who wants to collaborate on an audiobook

1322
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,359
version

1323
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,119
there's um

1324
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,280
no lack of

1325
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,480
act imp

1326
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,839
tasks

1327
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,520
today

1328
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,920
and these are like

1329
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,480
high leverage point

1330
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,680
moments

1331
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,520
where staying in the game and improving

1332
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,319
the game will do tremendous service

1333
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,200
towards reducing research debt and

1334
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,839
improving the rigor and the applications

1335
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,599
that we see

1336
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,000
rohan

1337
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,400
yeah uh can i make a project suggestion

1338
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,440
that's fine yes please

1339
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,599
everyone can yeah so that

1340
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,400
yeah okay so there is uh i'm gonna put

1341
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,960
this in the chat there's this online lab

1342
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,800
by georgia tech's intelligence

1343
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,160
assistance unit

1344
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,559
uh called robutario

1345
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,040
uh that's basically a bunch of swarm

1346
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,160
it's to test swamp controllers

1347
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,359
so uh there's a good baseline over here

1348
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,319
it would be a good idea to try like an

1349
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,559
active inference version

1350
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,200
like an active inference inspired swamp

1351
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,400
controller

1352
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,680
to finish the tasks over here

1353
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,400
so this runs on actual robots

1354
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,680
in that lab

1355
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,480
and you can see the results

1356
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,319
this is awesome um

1357
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,280
i had

1358
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,800
some

1359
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,480
colleagues who worked with

1360
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,119
some of the ant groups here

1361
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,480
it's right at the intersection of

1362
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,920
like

1363
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,800
jf's work and many's interest in

1364
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,359
embodied and robotic angle

1365
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,359
and we have

1366
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,040
somewhat

1367
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,400
extensive

1368
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,559
um

1369
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,520
multi-scale generative models

1370
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,760
of ants

1371
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,200
which would apply to other swarm

1372
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,880
settings as well so absolutely

1373
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,400
um

1374
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,599
we

1375
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,720
want to scaffold those projects and

1376
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,240
one way to start but not the only way to

1377
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,119
start

1378
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,400
is to

1379
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,119
copy a version of this

1380
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,119
these fields and add and remove as

1381
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,640
relevant for you

1382
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,280
and give some

1383
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,440
um

1384
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
handle

1385
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,400
for others to be involved or just

1386
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,559
stay in the game

1387
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,599
so that um

1388
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,680
more people can join there will be a

1389
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,319
flow of people entering active inference

1390
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,799
forever

1391
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,880
how will we greet them

1392
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,640
so uh what would i need to put in

1393
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,640
um

1394
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:08,960
like

1395
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,040
it depends on how you want to carry

1396
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
forward the project but you can feel in

1397
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,880
this row add any

1398
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,359
notes you'd like

1399
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,280
and um

1400
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,040
more details on what you're thinking of

1401
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,160
doing

1402
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,839
and then however you want to be more

1403
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,680
specific about like

1404
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,359
directions

1405
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,319
and

1406
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,359
and

1407
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,160
just signal it in the idea

1408
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,280
or you can in the um notes or or draft

1409
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,640
catechism

1410
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,200
which is what these templates are

1411
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,759
based on

1412
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,680
and if there is ever something you're

1413
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,040
not

1414
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,119
sure about then

1415
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,440
ask around and um

1416
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,079
different projects are going to

1417
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,440
proceed

1418
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,920
differently

1419
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,680
okay yeah uh so i'll fill that out

1420
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,839
with my talk

1421
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,160
so awesome

1422
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,520
well

1423
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,040
interesting meeting

1424
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,480
it's our penultimate discussion in this

1425
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,640
section

1426
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,160
then we hope that

1427
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,680
everybody who is

1428
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,079
motivated and

1429
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,040
ready to do so

1430
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,200
continues for part two

1431
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,440
and or rejoins for part one cohort two

1432
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,680
both of these will be starting in

1433
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,040
september

1434
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,440
so we'll take august

1435
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,839
um off of the textbook

1436
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,119
and

1437
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,760
uh at this point the tentative plan is

1438
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,520
that we'll have

1439
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,160
two sequential hours

1440
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,040
like

1441
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,720
section one

1442
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,280
and then followed by section two

1443
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,640
so that those who are on section one

1444
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,960
can um

1445
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,040
see how

1446
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,000
section two is

1447
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
we can explore different architectures

1448
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and stuff and again this is like why

1449
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,160
people's active participation and their

1450
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,839
feedback

1451
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,880
and the over sharing

1452
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,880
on topic

1453
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,559
and just writing all the questions that

1454
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:21,839
came in their mind and all the things

1455
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,280
that they would want to ask somebody to

1456
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,640
check like

1457
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,400
every contribution is important

1458
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,079
does anyone else have any

1459
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,760
thing they'd like to add before we stop

1460
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,839
the recording

1461
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,599
okay

1462
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,319
stopping the recording

1463
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,359
oh yeah someone go for it

1464
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,599
all right stopping the recording
