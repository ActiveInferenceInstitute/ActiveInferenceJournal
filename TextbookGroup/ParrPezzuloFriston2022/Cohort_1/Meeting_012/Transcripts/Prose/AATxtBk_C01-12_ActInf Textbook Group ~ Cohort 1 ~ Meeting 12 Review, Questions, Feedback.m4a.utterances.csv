1370	327086	A	0.9287548657188015	Hey, everyone. Welcome to week twelve of active textbook group cohort one. We are in the Review and Synthesis weeks. It's been a great three monthish journey and it doesn't stop here but we'll will go over that. So two points of process for those who are here live and of course re watching and then we'll move to the more conceptual parts. So first in the onboarding page you'll see these two columns. The two columns are Rcping yes to join Cohort Two, part one going through chapters one through five if you would like to for a second time. Many people will be just doing it for fun or for learning or however they want. And also there's the opportunity to continue on with the second half of the textbook which is going to get into a lot of the hands on modeling and we'll be especially looking forward to developing a lot of the notebooks and interactive formats that will help us get a lot of understanding there. So please check yes for whichever row your name is in for whether you would like to continue on with part two as well as retake part one as well. You'd be welcome to be just a participant and also feel free to get in touch if you are interested in taking some other role such as like facilitating or scaffolding some aspect but we can talk more about that for those who are interested. So point one go to the onboarding list and continue on however you want. Second point if you go to Future Textbook Groups page you'll see an embedded form as well as a link to the form if you want it in a new window like that. This would be exceptionally requested and helpful for you to provide some evaluations numerically and as short or as long as you want on providing feedback. Those are one way that you can provide feedback anonymously. The second way is building on some of the ideas that people are already adding here. This is an editable page, so people can add thoughts as they see fit about what would be awesome for future textbook groups or any other feedback. Or, as always, they can email Activeinference@gmail.com if they want, like a response to any specific points. And then also it's provided here at the link to Share for people who want to join future cohorts. So that link will be like getting people onboarded into the next cohort which is September 2022 in this case. But this is going to be like an evergreen form that will just continue to have a list of people who expressed interest and be onboarding them into subsequent cohorts of which will begin several per year going forward. And next week we'll be talking more about the feedback specifically and about projects and about carrying on. Today is like a little bit of a more conceptual synthesis and review and again next week will be more like logistical and project oriented review. So just on these points or anything else, does anyone want to just raise their hand or unmute and share anything that they liked? Okay, let us conceptually review, then we read the first five chapters of the active inference textbook. Does anyone have overall thoughts that they'd like to provide at the five chapter scale? Then we're going to go into a chapter scale. Then we'll be continuing to dive in as Granularly as required. But at the scale of the first five chapters, you can see them here on this preface page as well as here in the chapters list. As a unit of five chapters, what were people's sense? How did it update? Yes, please, Ben. And then Ali.
327278	371860	B	0.95311832	Well, I was just going to say, I think, as I've said to people before, I think, coming from a non mathematics background, I thought that these chapters were really accessible in terms of the kind of conceptual things that they were putting on the table. But I just wondered what other people's opinions were in terms of understanding the conceptual toolkit of active inference before you've built up a kind of mathematical understanding, because I'm about to start kind of learning some of the mathematics behind it. And I wondered what people thought of the potential to fully grasp these concepts without the mathematics and what the relationship between the two might be. I'm just curious what other people think about that, I guess.
373510	379400	A	0.89029125	Thanks. Great question, Ali and then Mike and then anyone else who wants to chime in.
383820	508770	C	0.9283657142857137	Yeah, it was a pretty exciting journey for me, but I'll definitely need to read over all those five chapters once again, at least once again in order to grasp more fully the contents of those chapters. My own personal opinion about the way Materials is organized in the first part of the textbook is I couldn't see a kind of hierarchical or, I don't know, structural organization for these chapters as much as I like to. See them because sometimes they delve into theoretical aspect of all the things much more deeply than the mathematical side. And sometimes it's vice versa. But I think that if it was organized in a way that, as Ben mentioned, we can go from a firm conceptual foundation into the granular formalism and mathematics, at least for me, that would be much more accessible and much more I would be able to organize the materials in a much more coherent way in my mind. So one thing that I really enjoyed about these chapters is the kind of you see a kind of the vision it tries to put forward regarding the future possible research and also things especially in chapter five and the path that can be taken from this point on.
510260	513410	A	0.8653712500000001	Thank you, Ali. Mike and then anyone else?
514900	613968	D	0.9400704741379307	Yeah, I'll pick up from where Ali left off, I think it's somewhat remarkable that they were able to fit everything they did into those first five chapters. And understanding. They probably had some idea of how much space they wanted in that part of the book before getting into the practical or applied components. In part two, the high road, low road contrast and sort of coming at the problem from two different angles I think was useful. Like Ben, I found the math to be generally accessible, although I confess I think I still go through this sort of pattern where I feel like I get it and I have this intuitive understanding of it. But then there are things where I sort of bogged down and looking at some of the mathematical details or some of the graphical representations related to things like message passing have to slow down and sort of take those apart more. And I guess related to that, I should add, I think this group has been so good at taking apart the ideas of the book. This is perhaps one of the most effective settings I've seen for really wringing concepts out of a text. And the work that's going on with the coda to build up the ontology and take apart the equations and things like that I think is just tremendous awesome.
614054	776630	A	0.9229413043478262	Thank you. The British call them maths, plural instead of math as an area. And it really does engage. Like there's visual formalisms which could be represented with a sparsity matrix or it could be represented with other ways. But there are almost like a multiscale diversity of formalisms ranging from more traditional equal sign in the middle mathematics to fusion, schematic, equation graphics, different types of notations even within the equation. And the difficulty is not signaled. Not that it has to be, but the difficulty does provide a little whiplash sometimes because it moves variously in the main thread of the text, the boxes and the appendices from like, this is how linear algebra works and this is what Bayes theorem is all the way to. Topics that are approaching physics flows on partitioned states, various kinds of fundamental, or like in principle, relationships about mathematics generally. All the way to postulated architectures where message passing is implemented to achieve some computational function and or thread the needle with resembling neuro computational architectures. The math is doing a lot. Many things are happening and so it's only to be expected that the perception is challenging and there's probably a lot more to even say and unpack there. Anyone else want to raise their hand and give a thought on this section? One Area. JF and Then anyone Else.
778440	779028	C	0.9641649999999999	Have kind.
779034	836810	E	0.9077286170212768	Of A general Question about The Limits Of Mathematics, the Notion Of Computational irreducibility that You Have To Go Through Every Step Of A Process to Get At State n plus. One from state n from state n minus whatever. That certain problems cannot be solved by plugging values into a formula and generating a future state. You have to compute all the intermediate states. I wonder where that fits in in this picture. Are there hard limits to the application of mathematics to the problem of active inference? It's just a general question.
854650	897860	A	0.9188547297297297	Returning to some earlier comments on the firm conceptual ground, what is an area, no matter how narrow or distal, from active, where people believe that there is a firm conceptual ground, they felt like that provided a foundation for them to learn further. Are we seeking an analogy to some other field of theory or practice or domain? Or are we kind of seeking for an epistemic territory that we haven't quite seen?
910090	948100	F	0.917129466666667	I'll just add I think that what inactive inference, what you're talking about there, Jeff, is literally blankets and uncertainty, like the corollary there of, like, computation and irreducibility is that there's some large amount of uncertainty in hidden states in the world that you're just never going to get at. The blanket is in some sense not just how you're relating to it, but some hard limit on your surprisal and things like that.
951160	956230	A	0.89063375	Thanks. Brock Blue had written yes, Mike, please.
958920	1010090	D	0.9290352727272725	So responding to the question about maybe adjacent SpaceX or spaces or topic areas, I think there's certainly overlap with concepts from system dynamics. And certainly a lot of agent based modeling has been applied to model systems that have feedback loops and adaptation, things like that. We discussed during the past weeks relationships with reinforcement learning. And I think there's a belief that active inference kind of cleans up some of the challenging, or maybe not challenging, but less formalized or less defined aspects related to reinforcement learning, such as how do you engineer a utility function that makes sense in the context of what you're trying to model?
1020170	1339960	A	0.9121364551422319	Thanks agreed about creating an integrated utility function. There's so many unprincipled, not to say ineffective or not even to say not elegant but unprincipled methods of creating a chimera utility model like delay, discounting, novelty, bonus, curiosity, bonuses, alternating phases or hyperparameters, as well as purely implementational strategies like discarding burn in parallel chains. There's like a whole toolkit and indeed fields on creating effectively integrated utility models and putting that work into the construction of the generative model. And how the generative model is partitioned from the generative process allows a generic free energy functional or set of related free energy formulations to play that role. So that's one very interesting angle, as well as the way that that process of specifying the generative model and generative processes and so on are world models, whether in the Yon Lacoun sense or in the Adam Safron sense. These generative models encompass world models and deep learning approaches and various topics like that. So let's see. Blue wrote, I wish there was practice problems in the book to develop our understanding yes, to a large extent. And also whether people want to reflect on any specific questions or even just on this scheme. These are many of these questions. These questions can be open, infinite game type questions about the material. They can be clearly addressable questions about the material. They can be checks for understanding, but we'll be continuing to develop and improve and curate questions around the material. So I think it's a great comment and this is why we have this future textbook groups and all of these affordances for people to stay involved and be improving this, as well as experimenting in their own spaces and ways to develop the kinds of material that are helping them learn and understand any more. Section one overview thoughts, chapters one through five and the framing of the book being that the first five chapters are more focused on the conceptual background and the second five chapters are going to be starting with a recipe for designing the active models and getting more into the modeling itself. So any section one through five commentary the book comprises two parts, page three. These are aimed at readers who want to understand active inference first part, and those who seek to use it for their own research second part. The first part of the book introduces active inference, both conceptually and formally contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. How did they succeed and where? Was there a divergence between what you preferred a priori or now comprehensive, formal and self contained introduction to active inference, its main constructs and implications for the study of brain and cognition?
1353560	1380930	B	0.938338732394366	I'm interested in the distinction between understanding active inference and using it for our own research and the way that that's set up as those being two completely separate things. It seems to suggest that one could fully understand active inference and yet not be in a position to use it in their own research, not having worked through the second half of the book. And I think that's quite interesting.
1385220	1466530	A	0.9337634210526313	It is. Good comment. Thank you. Not to spoil the ending, but the last sentence is ultimately we are confident that you will continue to pursue active inference in some form. There may be a multi year incubation for different people in contexts many people now or even in some amazing decentralized science future. They may not think of themselves as researchers or of doing research, though they may be even included on research projects. So it's a very interesting comment about how they distinguish theory and learning from part two, research and practice, however they discuss applications. But this isn't the playbook, it's not the toolkit, it's not the modeling tool ecosystem. Mike.
1468870	1503280	D	0.939701084337349	Yeah, that's an interesting comment at the end, and I don't know if this is my perceptual bias, but there seems to be this implicit assumption that active inference is the way to go. Basically, this is the tool to use within the text. As a result, what's not there is a discussion of maybe these are cases where you might not want to use active inference, or these are cases where applying active inference could create challenges in what you're solving for.
1511370	1513500	A	0.996525	Ali and anyone else.
1515950	1529840	C	0.9273743333333334	And in fact, one of the most popular criticisms put toward the active inference or FEP in general is that it tries to explain everything. It ends up explaining nothing.
1533970	1551000	D	0.9359583333333332	Yeah, I think there's a risk of maybe not sufficiently constraining the problem space or leaving things undefined in a way that allow for active insurance to be the solution without a critical point of view.
1576090	1710230	A	0.8893004205607473	They highlight behavior and cognition. I mean, one could almost see even the name active inference as being a synthesis of action behavior and cognition inference in ways that as we're discovering and unpacking, they're integrated in ways that other formalisms of perception as a type of cognition. So we could just lump it there other frameworks of behavior and cognition have not integrated or have approached from a non first principles. Or maybe they do follow first principles, like the higher the impact factor, the better the paper, something like that. That's a first principle. No, just kidding. But placing it within the framework of cognition while also surfing on a wave of something like Pan cognitivism or like pan computationalism does expand the scope. And that's even before one starts to enter into the more recent research, especially where there is a highlight on system persistence, not simply in terms of the resistance to dissipation entropically, but in a relational context as repeated measurements, like in the quantum work. So it's like cognition. Oh, like brains, like that schema with the brain or with like a person. Well, oh, by cognition, it's any system with a blanket that we're interacting with through repeated measurement. Is that cognition? Where did cognition go? Brock.
1714090	1809480	F	0.9397062626262624	I kind of want to, I guess, echo all those things that were just said about a common criticism and this where does it apply? Where does it not apply? But also, I guess all those things that you were just listing. I always hear that from people that have not engaged with the material and from my engagement with it, it seems like all of the examples in which it is used are complex, dynamical systems that don't have great, that have, at best, mathematical approximations and have almost no or literally no kind of analytical approaches. It just seems like a good way to model a system of things, of entities that are interacting. And I guess what I'm to put it into one question is that kind of some anthropomorphizing or whatever projecting of like, well, it's applied to this, it's applied to that, it must apply to everything. And how can it apply to all those things? How can it apply everywhere? It's not applying to everywhere. It's just applying to these complex systems which are everywhere but also don't have and we're not trying to model the apple falling from the tree or.
1811290	1811654	A	0.99996	These.
1811692	1841040	F	0.9069857971014491	Sorts of simple cases or something. It's not being applied there, is it? I haven't seen actually, now that I think about it, any of those sorts of situations where it's applied to things that we already understand, maybe in some back checking way, but not in a way that's suggested that we should use this much more complex approach to something that's kind of check. Already got that.
1845510	1847410	A	0.9756300000000001	Thanks, Brock. Ali.
1849910	1911160	C	0.9019091489361702	I kind of feel that some of these criticisms stems from the fact from a serious lack of deep understanding of concepts related to FEP and active inference. For example, I came across a PhD thesis just today in which it tries to critique everything related to Markup Blanket. But as I was glancing over it, I observed some serious gaps in our argument throughout all the thesis. And I think materials such as this book can definitely help in filling up these gaps of understanding which even the serious researchers are suffering from.
1914180	2019296	A	0.9211404545454539	Yes, thanks. So to this thread, I've never heard it about the linear model. How could the linear model be used in so many settings? It explains nothing. Well, is the linear model an explanation or is it an investigative tool in the investigator's toolbox? So at least for me personally, doesn't need to have broader reach than those who resonate with it. But again, I always try to ask, would somebody say this or could they say that about a linear model? And then if the active formalism with f equals dot dot dot dot dot or g equals dot dot dot dot dot, and all of the predicates that it's associated with and the partition and all of that, could someone say that about y equals MX plus b? And then if not, and there may be cases where it is not the same, what is it that's different about active inference? Or is it a valid and important and even reasonable question, but one that might be bumping up like what JF raised about computational irreducibility or about map territory even disguised or camouflaged questions about relationality? Well, how can complexity science apply to so many topics? We're applying complexity science to whatever topic we want to. Where's the issue? Mike and then ron yeah, a lot.
2019318	2093950	D	0.9466819999999997	Of it hinges on how the model is to be applied and what the intent of model application is. So taking the linear model as an example, we might use something like that to be predictive about a linear system. And so there's potential value there. When we do system dynamics models, a lot of times the value in doing a system dynamics model is aligning the stakeholders around what are the model components and how do we think about those model components. So working through a process similar to what we've done in this textbook group, although few do it as rigorously to identify the system elements and how they interact and interrelate and so forth. And that can lead to more advanced implementation like agent based models. But a lot of times, at least in my experience, those agent based models are used for deeper systems understanding more than, say, predictive power for what the system is going to do at some point in the future. So again, it comes back to the reason for applying the models and thinking about how the model fits with that reason and what sort of results you would expect from that.
2095120	2096780	A	0.90031	Thank you. Mike? Ron?
2100000	2161680	G	0.91696472	Yeah, I generally agree with what both you and Mike said. So from a practitioner's perspective, we do hear criticisms of linear models, right? It's not that we don't, but it's usually about which domain is applied in. But generally speaking, well, let me put it this way because active inference is probably more complex and it takes a lot more time to crop than Y equals MX plus b, which could be one reason for these kind of criticisms. And it's probably like they're falling back into old habits. Okay, why should I jump my old model as opposed to adopting this newer, more the? How much more does it explain than what I think that probably is driving a lot of the criticism.
2166100	2535450	A	0.9159151967213129	Thank you. I can't help but add a domain specific example. This is a 2016 paper that is speaking to like a multi decade multi career brouhaha about different approaches to modeling evolution and selection. For example, in the eusocial insects and in social animals as well. And this article is very fascinating because they use a Bayesian causal graph to identify situations where two different formulations can and the multilevel selection models have identical predictions. Where the causal graphs have identical predictions. Any measurement you can think of as being like on a Y equals x manifold where it doesn't resolve your uncertainty about which framework is correct or not. Yet the literature is littered with we measured these ovaries, so kin selection is or isn't happening. However, a vast set of those empirical cases might be essentially falling on this manifold where those two models are not distinguishable. And so this is a theory driven approach, like a first principles approach to identify situations that are providing unique informative value. In this case about canon multilevel selection and knowing what territories measurements will not have explanatory value, which relates to active inference. Just like Rohan and like many people have brought up, especially when we kind of take like a meta science or like a communicating science or onboarding people into active concern, people are asking explicitly or implicitly why should I update my cognitive model? What is the value of active inference? Can you appetize me with a two minute video so I can understand it? Or with a two minute video so it's enough to want to continue going down that path? There's a lot to say and there's a lot of work to identify the situations and the ways of truly addressing and perhaps even resolving long standing scientific divergences. Like, if it is the case that the explore exploit dialectic is addressed in a novel way through the free energy functional balancing pragmatic and epistemic reward, that is quite a vast scope. People continue to use, explore and exploit today and it is the evident that those ontology terms wouldn't be useful in the future. In fact, some of the discussions on like folk psychology with the belief, desires, intentions can we say what an active inference entity wants or intends based upon its beliefs and its desires? For example, can we still talk about exploratory and exploitative behavior as a phenomena but have a different way of modeling how that behavior arises or is regulated? What are the settings in behavioral cognitive science? What are the settings where systems dynamics has been applied where we can now use active inference to identify? Where have we been just throwing a thousand darts at the same grain of sand? Where are the vast fields where we don't even know? And as people have highlighted, the book is written with a specific rhetorical bent, both explicitly and implicitly. For the regime of attention of the book to be about active inference, one can read as an implicit endorsements that this is something that is valid or valuable to pursue. And especially at this stage in the field, it is almost like an exhortation to persist amidst uncertainty, to learn and apply few disjointed thoughts there but hope it makes sense. Let's look back to the sections of the book. Anyone can raise their hand or give a thought like how could the book you write begin? What reviewer comments? Whether you're reviewer one, reviewer two, reviewer three. What comments would you have provided if this were, like, a draft? And you could even make structural suggestions.
2545010	2547118	H	0.9955200000000001	So I have a lot of comments there.
2547284	2548990	A	0.9029900000000002	Yes. Blue. And then Ron.
2549410	2625480	H	0.9300455345911947	Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. Having taught lots of classes before, I think a list of key terms and definitions would be critical. And learning objectives for each chapter, like I said, like a practice quiz. Test your knowledge of this. What is surprise? Like, how many different forms of surprise are there? Just some practice questions to see if you grasped the concepts prevented in each chapter and especially what I was mentioning in the chat like math problems can you set up your own generative model? Or even just the Bayesian graph? Can you make a Bayesian graph? What would that look like for give a question like a verbal description and then give the Bayesian graph answer or make the answers available online so you could test your own knowledge of the subject first. I think that that would be totally instrumental in using this functionally like a textbook anyway, so sorry.
2626810	2632010	A	0.9287944444444444	Thanks Blue. Nice predictive programming. Rohan and then Brock.
2634350	2722440	G	0.9355451960784311	Yeah. As a practitioner, I work in the engineering field. I'm a control systems engineer. My preference would be to immediately see some application not necessarily to control systems, but something that it begins with like a project and explains how active inference is better than its own baseline. That would be interesting to see. Like a perfect example of this would be I don't know if you've heard of Fast AI by Rachel Thomas and Jeremy Howard. They have a very unique way of teaching. So they have a computational linear algebra course. So the way they teach the linear algebra part is by basically implementing Gaussian loader, for example, and then connecting it to so you start with the code and then you do the math, then you connect it to the math. So something like that might be far more useful, maybe not from a point, but it would definitely be useful for practitioners around the world. Okay, so if Controls engineer gets this okay, this looks like a better form model predictive control. I can replace my model predictive controller with something that resembles active inference. We might actually make more progress that it actually gets out of the way.
2725050	2726950	A	0.967295	Thank you, Ron Brock.
2730190	2734570	F	0.8707957142857142	Yeah, I've had similar comments to that.
2734640	2735260	A	0.89	Of.
2738670	2770054	F	0.9358052307692306	Fast AI and Benchmarks. That's kind of the ultimate way. That's just the way that practitioners change their attention now. And that would be really useful. But in the context of the book, I think I agree with everything else that was said too. I'm not sure how realistic it is to do that from the point where the whole field is at right now.
2770092	2771080	A	0.8254366666666666	Sorry about that.
2771690	2947200	F	0.9303134626865672	But I think just having some things in context, there's always this comment about it's a nonlinear thing. Text is linear, so of course it will be out of out of order. But often the definitions of things are kind of scattered throughout the explanation of them and kind of italicized instead of kind of brought up to the top in some way. You might expect, at least from my pedagogical experience, everything like all math is taught to define your knowns and unknowns and variables at the top and this sort of thing right in the context of the appendices. Again, I understand that it's a lot, you can't add that all in or whatever, but just if there was like either every whenever the next part of the appendices became relevant, again, just like having it at the top at each section you're like, okay, so we're going to use part now, building on what we've done already. Now we're going to use this part of this section in the appendices. In this section our equation, one, two, three, whatever. In this next section, like just stating it up front again, just like a big box at the top or whatever, it just would help in way finding and disentangling the unfortunate linear format of books that is mapped to this complex thing. I don't know, those general things would be helpful. One other thing that is maybe beyond the scope of this book, but spoke to Ali about very briefly at one point about the notation. Like even in the basic example of the frog here, like Bayesian notation, it's incredibly easy to manipulate variables when they're one letter and subscripts, but. When the whole variable is like ten or 20 letters, like p of x equals frog jump condition on a y, it becomes a larger I don't know if this is just me and Dyslexic, I don't know, but it just seems harder to cognitively kind of work with that.
2951920	3021590	A	0.938306277372262	I don't know. Thank you, Brock. Yes, the chunking is multilevel and it will be great to explore ways to learn around that. Here are a few forays where we can copy quotes and have in line definitions. So for those who are interested in this kind of work with an open source textbook, it is not an infinite task or even a non automatable task to copy out the plain text and integrate it with a versioning ontology so that the definition can be even rendered differently. It could be in a different language, it could be every single time that a term comes up. There's like so much enrichment that this seed can lead to of the textbook and a lot of it is for us to pick up. Honestly. Rohan and then anyone else?
3025480	3027460	G	0.9043633333333334	Oh, I forgot to put down.
3027610	3170560	A	0.9258962557077624	Oh, no worries. Thank you. So in our last seven or so minutes for this session next week, we will continue with any conceptual points and questions that people want to raise. We'll also be turning our attention a bit more to making sure first off that please, please everyone complete the feedback form in the future textbook groups and or add information here or contact us because it's just one of the most important feedback mechanisms we have. We'll also be exploring a little bit different project ideas, several of these threads involving different system models we've already found a home for in the Active Blockprints project where we're meeting twice on Wednesdays weekly. Other projects we're going to have new vistas on during and after going through the second half of the textbook, which is still black and white static PDFs, but we'll be able to augment this heavily with some simulation tools as well as other work like the Plain Text Enrichment, or even anyone who wants to collaborate on an audiobook version. There's no lack of active tasks today and these are like high leverage point moments where staying in the game and improving the game will do tremendous service towards reducing research debt and improving the rigor in the applications that we see. Rohan?
3174830	3179420	G	0.9646633333333333	Yeah? Can I make a project suggestion? That's fine.
3179870	3182410	A	0.9660925	Yes please. Everyone can?
3182480	3221510	G	0.8682455696202532	Yeah. Okay, so there is put this in the chat. There's this online lab by Georgia Tech's Intelligence Systems unit called Robotario that's basically a bunch of swarm. It's to test swarm controllers. So there's a good baseline over here. It would be a good idea to try like an active inference version, like an active inference inspired swarm controller to finish the tasks. So this runs on actual robots in that lab and you can see the results.
3223710	3300770	A	0.9300538095238093	This is awesome. I had some colleagues who worked with some of the ant groups here. It's right at the intersection of JF's work and many's interest in the embodied and robotic angle. And we have somewhat extensive multi scale generative models of ants which would apply to other swarm settings as well. So absolutely we want to scaffold those projects. And one way to start, but not the only way to start, is to copy a version of these fields and add and remove as relevant for you and give some handle for others to be involved or just stay in the game so that more people can join. There will be a flow of people entering active inference forever. How will we greet them?
3300920	3304420	G	0.9585890000000001	So what would I need to put in over there?
3309110	3354370	A	0.9408465909090906	It depends on how you want to carry forward the project. But you can feel in this row, add any notes you'd like and more details on what you're thinking of doing. And then however you want to be more specific about directions and just signal it in the idea. Or you can in the notes or draft catechism, which is what these templates are based on. And if there is ever something you're not sure about, then ask around and different projects are going to proceed differently.
3356550	3361090	G	0.893969	Okay. Yeah. So I'll fill that out with my talks.
3361770	3473310	A	0.927540058479532	Awesome. Well, interesting meeting. It's our penultimate discussion in this section. Then we hope that everybody who is motivated and ready to do so continues for part two and or rejoins for part one, cohort two. Both of these will be starting in September. So we'll take August off of the textbook. And at this point, the tentative plan is that we'll have two sequential hours, like section one and then followed by section two so that those who are on section one can see how section two is. We can explore different architectures and stuff. And again, this is like why people's active participation and their feedback and the oversharing on topic and just writing all the questions that came in their mind and all the things that they would want to ask somebody to check. Like every contribution is important. It does anyone else have anything they'd like to add before we stop the recording? Stopping the recording? Oh, yeah. Someone go for it. All right. Stopping the recording.
