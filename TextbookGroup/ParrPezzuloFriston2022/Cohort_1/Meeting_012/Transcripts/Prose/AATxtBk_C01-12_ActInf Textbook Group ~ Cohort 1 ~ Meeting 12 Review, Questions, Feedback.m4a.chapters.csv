1370	231174	00:01	This is week twelve of active textbook group cohort one. We are in the Review and Synthesis weeks. Today is like a little bit of a more conceptual synthesis and review. Next week we'll be talking more about the feedback specifically and about projects.	Welcome to week twelve of active textbook group cohort one	Active Textbook Group Cohort 1
231292	956230	03:51	We read the first five chapters of the active inference textbook. Does anyone have overall thoughts that they'd like to provide at the five chapter scale? Then we'll be continuing to dive in as Granularly as required.	We read the first five chapters of the active inference textbook	Active Inference: The First 5 Chapters
958920	1226374	15:58	There's overlap with concepts from system dynamics. How do you engineer a utility function that makes sense in the context of what you're trying to model? Blue wrote, I wish there was practice problems in the book to develop our understanding. These are many of these questions.	Active inference cleans up some of the challenging aspects related to reinforcement learning	Questions about the generative model in deep learning
1226492	1915330	20:26	The book is aimed at readers who want to understand active inference first part and those who seek to use it for their own research second part. One of the most popular criticisms put toward the active inference or FEP in general is that it tries to explain everything.	The book comprises two parts. The first part introduces active inference, both conceptually and formally	Active Inference: Research and Practice
1916100	2722440	31:56	How can complexity science apply to so many topics? We're applying complexity science to whatever topic we want to. Of it hinges on how the model is to be applied and what the intent of model application is.	So to this thread, I've never heard it about the linear model	Liner vs Multilevel Inference
2725050	3361090	45:25	The definitions of things are kind of scattered throughout the explanation of them and kind of italicized. It would help in way finding and disentangling the unfortunate linear format of books that is mapped to this complex thing. We'll also be exploring a little bit different project ideas.	Ron Brock: I agree with everything else that was said too	Inventing the Bayesian Model in a Textbook
3361770	3446482	56:01	The tentative plan is that we'll have two sequential hours, like section one and then followed by section two. Both of these will be starting in September. Like every contribution is important.	Both cohort one and two will be starting in September	C cohort 2 discussion
3446576	3473310	57:26	It does anyone else have anything they'd like to add before we stop the recording? Oh, yeah. Someone go for it. All right. Stopping the recording.	It does anyone else have anything they'd like to add before we stop the recording	Oh, Stop the Recording
