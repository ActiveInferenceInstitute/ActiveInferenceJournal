00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:02,620
Daniel: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:05,353
Thanks for joining the second meeting

3
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:05,353
where we're going to be discussing

4
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:08,726
chapter one.

5
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:12,317
It's the active Textbook group and it's

6
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:13,434
May 12, 2022.

7
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:16,773
You can click on my screen and that will

8
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,954
show you the full screen.

9
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:22,395
We updated the live meeting page a bit

10
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,395
and it's just like all these other pages,

11
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,395
a work in progress, but hopefully this

12
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,395
will be a structure where we'll be able

13
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,395
to hear everyone's perspective and leave

14
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,395
the coda in a better place than we found

15
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:35,684
it.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,995
So what we'll do in the live meetings,

17
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:38,995
which from here on out, or at least for

18
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:38,995
here for the next two and a half months

19
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:38,995
or so, are going to be driven by the

20
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:38,995
material in the chapters and in the

21
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:51,273
appendices.

22
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,663
We're going to go to the questions page

23
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:55,663
and we're going to look at the questions

24
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:55,663
that have been asked for that week for

25
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:55,663
that theme, and we're just going to start

26
00:00:55,663 --> 00:01:06,131
with the most upvoted questions.

27
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:08,333
And then we're going to be taking notes

28
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:08,333
in the answers, in the discourse, and we'

29
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:08,333
'll go into a little bit more detail when

30
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:13,849
we flip to that page.

31
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,174
And then after addressing questions for

32
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:16,174
probably most of the time and discussing

33
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:16,174
that, we'll go pull back a little bit

34
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:26,101
more broadly like ideas for that week.

35
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,477
And then in the last minutes we can just

36
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:29,477
see if there's been any changes to the

37
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:29,477
project ideas and start to see what

38
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:29,477
people are excited about applying active

39
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:38,345
inference to.

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,633
And then we'll end at the top of the hour

41
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:42,793
and take a quick break.

42
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:44,976
And then there'll be a Tools

43
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:44,976
organizational unit meeting following for

44
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:44,976
those who want to just listen or

45
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:51,059
participate in tools.

46
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,083
So let's head over to Questions and I'm

47
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:53,083
going to hide the sidebar because we're

48
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:57,128
going to be mostly here in Questions.

49
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:00,099
Okay, so it's awesome.

50
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:03,128
And also Control and plus minus or

51
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:03,128
Control and scroll is like a good way to

52
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:08,172
resize how it looks.

53
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,229
So this is our first week with this

54
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:13,229
format and anyone's welcome to suggest a

55
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:13,229
variant or a different way to carry this

56
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:22,311
out.

57
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:25,342
But the co organizers of the textbook

58
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:25,342
group kind of thought we could do

59
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:30,395
something along these lines.

60
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,418
The questions we're going to be looking

61
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,431
at are in chapter one.

62
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,461
So that's the chapter we're discussing

63
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:37,461
today and we're going to start with the

64
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:37,461
ones that have the most upvotes in the

65
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:37,461
interesting and just spend a couple of

66
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:48,575
minutes on each of the questions.

67
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,607
And at any point there are the

68
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:51,607
affordances of just listening and also,

69
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:58,675
of course re watching this recording.

70
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,639
There's also the affordance in gather to

71
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:00,639
raise your hand if you'd like to share on

72
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:00,639
that question that we're going to have up.

73
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,686
.

74
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:08,716
And additionally by clicking on the

75
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:08,716
answers in discourse, that will pull up a

76
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:08,716
focused view on that question and

77
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:08,716
everybody can collaboratively edit the

78
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:20,830
answers and discourse.

79
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,851
And so it's better to add and be noisy

80
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:22,851
even if it's a bullet point list or an

81
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:22,851
incomplete sentence or there's

82
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:27,906
incoherence or it's contradictory.

83
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:28,919
Those are all fine.

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,950
It just adds information and perspectives

85
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,963
to the question.

86
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,992
So, yeah, we're going to go to each

87
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:36,992
question, open up the answers and

88
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:36,992
discourse, read the question, see what

89
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:36,992
has already been contributed in the

90
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:47,100
answers and discourse.

91
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,127
And then also if people want to share

92
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:49,127
other thoughts that they're having, that'

93
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:53,165
's awesome.

94
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:56,190
And then also if anybody wants to be

95
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,190
taking other notes, just things that are

96
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,190
coming to mind that they don't want to

97
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,190
share in a speaking way or just taking

98
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,190
some notes on what other people are

99
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:05,228
saying.

100
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:11,283
So let's just go into it.

101
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,312
And I'll be just keeping an eye for the

102
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:14,312
raised hand in gather for anybody who

103
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:18,351
wants to speak.

104
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:21,383
So starting with this first question,

105
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:21,383
maybe we can have addressed during

106
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:27,441
recording or something like that.

107
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,487
How do you understand the distinction

108
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:31,487
between the high road and the low road to

109
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:35,522
active inference?

110
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,547
What do you think is interesting or

111
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,564
useful about this distinction?

112
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,590
So does anybody want to just summarize

113
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:42,590
how they were thinking about the high and

114
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,625
the low road?

115
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,651
Or we can look at what others have

116
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:49,668
already written here.

117
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,754
What is the difference between the high

118
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:05,766
road and the low road?

119
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,786
Are there other roads?

120
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,809
Are there high and low roads to other

121
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,815
theories?

122
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,864
What is this metaphor with the roads?

123
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,033
So let's check out yes.

124
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:34,051
Ali and then Mallory.

125
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,118
Ali: Well, I believe it's just another

126
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:40,118
term for top down or bottom up approach

127
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:45,162
in a kind of way.

128
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:49,203
And well, the high road, I believe,

129
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
starts from the actualized mind itself

130
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
and tries to derive the underlying

131
00:05:49,203 --> 00:06:01,268
mechanisms or underlying principles.

132
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:07,321
But the bottom up approach, or in other

133
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:07,321
words, low road, tries to start from the

134
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:07,321
elements, tries to start from the

135
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:07,321
unorganized elements, let's say, and

136
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:07,321
derive the higher mechanisms or higher

137
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:07,321
order mechanisms actualizing the mind

138
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:29,547
itself.

139
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,582
Daniel: Thank you.

140
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:33,589
Awesome.

141
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:35,602
Mallory.

142
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:38,638
Mallory: Yeah.

143
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,662
I was just going to maybe recapitulate, I

144
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:41,662
guess, what I wrote in the comments, and

145
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:41,662
I see now that I probably should have

146
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:41,662
written straight in the Answers in

147
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:49,740
Discourse section.

148
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,753
So sorry about that.

149
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:55,805
But I really appreciated this schematic

150
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:55,805
because I've read papers that I think

151
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:55,805
come at active inference from both of

152
00:06:55,805 --> 00:07:05,845
these angles.

153
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,860
And in trying to understand.

154
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:09,884
I don't.

155
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:12,916
Know, the framework, I think it wasn't

156
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:12,916
super clear to me how all of these

157
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:12,916
different terms that are really nicely

158
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:12,916
outlined in this figure, Figure 1.2, are

159
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:24,033
related to one another.

160
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:28,074
So just to have it, I think, laid out

161
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:28,074
like this, it was really very helpful and

162
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:28,074
I think still being kind of new to the

163
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:39,184
concepts and such.

164
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:43,224
I liked the way they framed it in terms

165
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:43,224
of kind of the high road describing the

166
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:43,224
kind of what and why and the low road

167
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:53,329
being more about the how.

168
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,341
I thought that was really very useful.

169
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:03,369
So, yeah, I loved it and I saved it and

170
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:06,394
will probably reference it quite often.

171
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,425
Daniel: Yeah, agreed.

172
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,447
It's really useful.

173
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,482
And it touches on Aristotle's multiple

174
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:15,482
whys, where some of the whys are more

175
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:15,482
like hows or they're sort of proximate

176
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:24,576
mechanisms or more ultimate mechanisms.

177
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,618
And we can look at Figure 1.2.

178
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,648
So active inference is in the middle and

179
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:32,658
the high road.

180
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,688
I guess this is the starting train stop

181
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:35,688
here with a free energy principle, which

182
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:41,749
some later questions also might invoke.

183
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,783
And then it kind of goes down to active

184
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
inference, whereas starting with Bayes

185
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
theorem also gets us to sentient behavior,

186
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
, sentient being like sensing and feeling

187
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
and acting not as much on the qualia and

188
00:08:45,783 --> 00:09:00,875
experiential side.

189
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:04,917
So what else do we have in the answers?

190
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:08,951
So high road, what and why that is

191
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:08,951
starting with sort of the organismal

192
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:08,951
imperative, or like Ali, I think, said,

193
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:18,052
there the actualized mind.

194
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:21,081
And then what are the underlying

195
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,081
principles that make adaptive behavioral

196
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,081
systems working down the castle in the

197
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,081
sky is the adaptive behavior and

198
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,081
intelligent cognitive behavior, what is

199
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:35,223
under it?

200
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,252
And then the low road doesn't begin with

201
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:39,264
that imperative.

202
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:42,295
It starts with the elements, like the low

203
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,315
road, starting with Bayes.

204
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:47,346
None of these necessarily have to be, or

205
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:47,346
at least maybe until you get to Bayesian

206
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:50,373
brain.

207
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,392
These don't have to be adaptive.

208
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,419
A generative model doesn't have to be

209
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,433
resisting entropy.

210
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,460
So it's sort of like here's where we see

211
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,460
a lot of the elements in the machinery

212
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,460
and then on the top is more of the self

213
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,460
organization resistance to dissipation

214
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:07,487
autopoiesis.

215
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,498
How are you going to get there?

216
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:11,525
You have to be minimizing your surprise.

217
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,558
What does that actually entail?

218
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,582
And then active inference is like this

219
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,594
intermediate stop.

220
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,620
And again, maybe there's other roads or

221
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,633
there's other paths.

222
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:28,691
Any other thoughts on high road and low

223
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:28,694
road?

224
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,730
Or we'll continue to the next question.

225
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,758
This is just being introduced in chapter

226
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:34,758
one because the following chapters two

227
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:34,758
and three, which we're going to get to

228
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:34,758
after the appendix A and B are going to

229
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:44,850
detail the low road and the high road.

230
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:47,888
So this is kind of like a map for some of

231
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:47,888
the next steps that we're going to be

232
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:51,922
engaging in.

233
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:57,988
Okay, next question.

234
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:02,974
The concept of organisms minimizing

235
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:05,006
surprise is introduced on page six.

236
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,034
How are prior assumptions or beliefs

237
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:08,034
established when the organism is in new

238
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,075
or novel environments?

239
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:28,236
So anyone can raise their hand or take a

240
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:28,236
note here Mallory or Ali with raised

241
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:40,355
hands.

242
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,498
One helpful approach might be to think

243
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:54,498
about like the question is asking about

244
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:59,544
new and novel environments.

245
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:03,524
So are we dealing with categorical

246
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:07,566
novelty or with quantitative novelty?

247
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,589
Like, I was measuring the temperature and

248
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:09,589
then I'm in a new environment where the

249
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,624
temperature is different.

250
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:15,645
That's one type of novelty.

251
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:18,677
But there might also be like this novelty

252
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:18,677
at an even higher level with like I was

253
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:18,677
looking at previously, I was looking at

254
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:18,677
temperature, and now I'm in a place where

255
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:30,792
I'm having priors about smell.

256
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,826
So that's like a sort of intermodal or

257
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:33,826
like a different type of thing that's

258
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:38,873
being tracked.

259
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:41,904
So that's a categorical novelty as

260
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:41,904
opposed to just updating the temperature

261
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:41,904
parameter in a different temperature room,

262
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:41,904
, whether the person who asked it is here

263
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:53,025
or not.

264
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:54,033
Oh, yes.

265
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:54,036
Okay.

266
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,055
Ali and Mike, go for it.

267
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,055
Ali: Yeah.

268
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:07,105
Well, again, if we're talking about the

269
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
human mind from the priors, we can infer

270
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
that well, it's something that's kind of

271
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
innate in human minds, something wired,

272
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
and I mean, perhaps genetically or in any

273
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
other biologically hardwired way, but

274
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
well, again, yes, the definition of a

275
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
novel situation varies according to what

276
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:46,491
we're exactly referring to.

277
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:51,542
And if a novel situation is something

278
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:51,542
that the organism hasn't ever presented

279
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:51,542
with, well, in that case, these priors or

280
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:51,542
these innate tendencies won't help it

281
00:13:51,542 --> 00:14:08,650
very much.

282
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:12,697
So in that case, it should probably go

283
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
along the way of constructing posteriors,

284
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
more actively, I believe, than in any

285
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:24,817
regular situation.

286
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:27,848
Daniel: Thank you, Ali.

287
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:29,862
Jessica;

288
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:30,871
and then Mike;

289
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,882
and then Steve.

290
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,908
Jessica: Hi.

291
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,943
I think maybe like, in this situation,

292
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:37,943
even though the agent might be

293
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:37,943
encountering something that hasn't

294
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:37,943
experienced before, they might use

295
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:37,943
something as proxy that they already know

296
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:37,943
and sort of like, project those

297
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:52,099
understanding into the new situation.

298
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,119
And then it's through action, et cetera.

299
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,142
Then they're going to be updating like,

300
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:57,142
okay, how true is it or isn't to what

301
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:57,142
they understand; but they might be making

302
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:57,142
some kind of projection based on what

303
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:57,142
they already know and things that look

304
00:14:57,142 --> 00:15:08,193
similar to that new experience.

305
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:11,225
Daniel: Awesome.

306
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,231
Thank you.

307
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,245
Mike and Steven.

308
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:16,274
Mike: Yeah, I was just going to comment.

309
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,307
In the case where the organism is brand

310
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:19,307
new and has no experience, I think Ali's

311
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:19,307
comments covered this a bit, that it will

312
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:19,307
have to be updating its priors fairly

313
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:19,307
rapidly and presumably starting with sort

314
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:33,446
of a wider distribution.

315
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:40,516
Daniel: Great.

316
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:41,526
Steven?

317
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,625
Steven: Yes.

318
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:54,653
Along the lines of what Jessica was

319
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,660
saying.

320
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:59,706
There has been some work in systematizing

321
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:03,680
that as case based reasoning.

322
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:07,723
Not necessarily in a Bayesian framework

323
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:07,723
here, but as a derivative of expert

324
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:07,723
systems, where when you get a new

325
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:07,723
scenario, you try to match that against

326
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:07,723
previous scenarios that you've already

327
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:07,723
seen and adapt it however necessary to

328
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:29,949
meet the new observations.

329
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:34,998
So that might be a place to look for

330
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:36,011
inspiration.

331
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,040
Daniel: Thanks.

332
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,070
Yeah.

333
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,099
And in the ontology work, and in a lot of

334
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:45,099
these questions, there's often like a

335
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:50,154
narrow answer and then a broader answer.

336
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,177
Like the narrow answer would be well,

337
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
again, if all your Bayesian model is

338
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
doing is looking at the thermometer

339
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
reading and then doing a calm and filter

340
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
and inferring the temperature in the room,

341
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
, well, then the answer of what happens

342
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
when you put it underwater or what

343
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
happens when you ask it to predict scent.

344
00:16:52,177 --> 00:17:08,273
.

345
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,296
It's kind of like a trivial answer, which

346
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,313
is it's just not a parameter.

347
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:16,349
In that script, nothing happens.

348
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:19,385
And then that's like the narrower answer,

349
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:19,385
which is often very deflationary or like,

350
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:24,434
very trivial answers.

351
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:27,462
And then there's also a broader question,

352
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:27,462
like in the ecological context or in the

353
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:27,462
organismal context, in the expert applied

354
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:27,462
context, what happens when there are

355
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:27,462
these different qualitative and

356
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:39,580
quantitative types of novelty?

357
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:42,610
And so sometimes it's like, there we are

358
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,610
in the middle again with the deflationary

359
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,610
or the narrow being too obvious and too

360
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:50,693
simple to be brought into action.

361
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,730
And then the bigger question, like how do

362
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:54,730
experts in medicine or some other field,

363
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:54,730
how do they handle different types of

364
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,747
novelty?

365
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:04,776
That's its own research question and

366
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:05,782
agenda.

367
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:10,839
Awesome.

368
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:15,883
Any other thoughts on this question about

369
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:16,890
priors?

370
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,917
And it's also very important note that

371
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:18,917
surprise is always relative to

372
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:18,917
expectations which are priors in the

373
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:18,917
Bayesian context, and those are granted

374
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:27,000
by the Generative model.

375
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:30,003
So surprise is not just free floating, it'

376
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
's in relationship to the outcomes as

377
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
expected by an organism, for example,

378
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
jessica, your hands raised, otherwise we'

379
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:38,011
'll go to the next question.

380
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:43,016
Awesome.

381
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:48,021
This question, I think, is pretty similar

382
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:50,023
to the previous one.

383
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,024
So if anybody wants to give a thought

384
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,025
otherwise, no worries.

385
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,027
Are the high road and low road the only

386
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,029
roads to active inference?

387
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:01,028
Or my active be like Rome, which I guess

388
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:01,028
we can unpack a little bit, many all

389
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:09,036
roads leading to it's.

390
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,039
J-F.

391
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:18,044
J-F: Yes, it's more of a general question.

392
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:18,044
.

393
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,049
For example, if what you're trying to

394
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,051
understand is race cars, right?

395
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:27,053
And you develop a mathematical framework

396
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:27,053
given a number of measurements, like the

397
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:27,053
weight of the car, the length of the car,

398
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:27,053
the torque of the engine, the adhesion of

399
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:27,053
the tires, the friction, and whatnot, you'

400
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:27,053
're able to predict how well the race car

401
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:27,053
is going to perform in different

402
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:41,068
conditions.

403
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,071
And whatnot does that mean that you're an

404
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:45,072
expert in race cars?

405
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,074
Does that explain the race car?

406
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:50,077
Could you engineer a race car based on

407
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,078
this knowledge?

408
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,083
So, talking about multiple different

409
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
roads, one road through the free energy

410
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
principle, I think is an analytical road

411
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
that looks at the outcomes of the

412
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
machinery of the living beings that try

413
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:15,096
to maintain homeostasis.

414
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:19,099
But how much does it say about the

415
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,103
implementation of those organisms?

416
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,107
Um, it says many things, but does it say

417
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:26,107
everything that we deem might deem

418
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:30,111
interesting?

419
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:36,117
So what are the limitations of this

420
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
framework, the active inference framework

421
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:42,123
defined by.

422
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:43,124
Daniel: The free energy principle?

423
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:47,128
J-F: What are its limitations on top of

424
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
what it given its capabilities, which are

425
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:52,133
which are, I think, enormous.

426
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,134
But there are limitations.

427
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:57,138
And and if there are limitations, that

428
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
means there are there must be other roads

429
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
that can be taken to circumvent these

430
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:04,139
limitations.

431
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,142
Daniel: Thank you.

432
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,144
Great comment, Ali.

433
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:18,153
Ali: Well, duluzan Gatavi in 1000

434
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
Plateaus has laid out the concept of

435
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:24,159
Rhizome.

436
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,162
I don't know if you're familiar with the

437
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
concept of Rhizome as opposed to an

438
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:31,166
arborescent structure.

439
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:36,170
Well, basically, the concept of Rhizome

440
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
expounds a knowledge structure in which

441
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
every concept can potentially be

442
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
connected to every other concept without

443
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
having to go through a principal trunk of

444
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
a knowledge tree, let's say, but in an

445
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
arborescent structure and not arborescent

446
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
knowledge structure, everything branches

447
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,170
up from a principal trunk, from a

448
00:21:36,170 --> 00:22:11,200
principal, let's say, base.

449
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:18,207
And I believe that in active inference, a

450
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
Rhizomatic approach can also be explored

451
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
not only by approaching to different

452
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
concepts via the high road or the low

453
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:38,227
road main or principal trunk.

454
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:42,231
It can potentially be approached from

455
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:45,234
seemingly unrelated concepts too.

456
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:53,242
Daniel: Awesome to maybe even approach a

457
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:53,242
limitation or a seemingly unrelated

458
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:57,246
concept.

459
00:22:57,246 --> 00:23:00,243
Both the high and the low road in this

460
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:00,243
textbook are formal, and they're both

461
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:06,249
grounded in, like, mathematical symbols.

462
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,255
So are there qualitative or non

463
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:15,258
mathematical roads?

464
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,261
Maybe some of the early roads are

465
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:18,261
mathematical, but is it possible that a

466
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:18,261
future road or path or tunnel or choose

467
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:18,261
your travel metaphor might not be that

468
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:28,271
case?

469
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,273
And then thanks for sharing.

470
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:33,276
That the resource there, because this is

471
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
another interesting angle which various

472
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
people have traced this evolution of

473
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
visual metaphor where it's like, things

474
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
are ladder like and scalar, and then

475
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
there's more of a bifurcating tree, and

476
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
then that becomes critiqued or

477
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
complexified into more of a network, like

478
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
with integration among species, for

479
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:59,302
example.

480
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,298
So there's sort of this movement from

481
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:01,298
linear through a tree, like a directed

482
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:01,298
acyclic graph towards something that's

483
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:07,304
more networked.

484
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:12,309
So that's a lot of interesting ideas.

485
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,311
Anything else that people want to add or

486
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,312
we'll continue on.

487
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:20,317
Okay, on page ten, they write, creatures

488
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
engaging in active inference actively

489
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
seek out salient sensory observations

490
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:29,326
that resolve their uncertainty.

491
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:32,328
So what is the relationship between

492
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:32,328
salience and the kind of observation that

493
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:36,333
reduces uncertainty?

494
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,336
Why is the relationship between salience

495
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,339
observation and uncertainty this way?

496
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,341
How does active inference frame this

497
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
relationship similarly or different from

498
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:48,345
which other specific frameworks?

499
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,349
So someone wrote, I like this question a

500
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
lot, eager to get a better understanding

501
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,352
of what constitutes salience.

502
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:59,356
Is salience referencing information that

503
00:24:59,356 --> 00:24:59,356
is self evidence or information that is

504
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:04,355
precise and surprising or dot dot, dot?

505
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:05,356
Yes.

506
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,359
I think attention and salience is

507
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
addressed more in papers on active

508
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
inference than at least just from a

509
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:19,370
preliminary pass of the book.

510
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,374
So attention and metacognitive mechanisms

511
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
are not going to be a core feature in the

512
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:28,378
book.

513
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:30,381
However, there's again been a lot of

514
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
interesting work on the neurobiology and

515
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
the computational aspects of salience and

516
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:36,386
attention.

517
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:43,394
We can click on the word and see a

518
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:43,394
definition, but this is not like the

519
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:47,398
final definition.

520
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,401
This is just what some have gotten to.

521
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:52,403
Salience is the extent to which a queue

522
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
or an observation commands the attention

523
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
of an agent, given their regime of

524
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:57,408
attention.

525
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:00,405
So potentially a little bit tautological,

526
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:00,405
like a salient observation is something

527
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:05,410
that is grabbing attention.

528
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,412
A salient cue is something that commands

529
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:07,412
attention.

530
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:08,413
Steven.

531
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,423
Steven: Yes, I would say that, especially

532
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
if we're defining it in that way, that

533
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
there are two elements to salience, and

534
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
one is what was pointed out in the

535
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
question, I guess, that you are reducing

536
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:34,439
uncertainty.

537
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:38,443
But there is also the question of what

538
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:38,443
uncertainty is worth reducing, and that

539
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:38,443
gets into utility and where it makes

540
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:48,453
sense to explore.

541
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:53,458
I don't know if we want to choose to

542
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
change the definition of salience to just

543
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
be the second of those or leave it as

544
00:26:53,458 --> 00:27:00,459
having both of those elements.

545
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,464
Daniel: Thanks! Mallory?

546
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:10,469
Mallory: I think something I don't

547
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
necessarily understand, which I would

548
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
appreciate maybe somebody speaking to a

549
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
little bit, is this is related actually

550
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
to a question I put in earlier about the

551
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
distinction between perception and

552
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
learning, but something that grabs

553
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:30,489
attention.

554
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:33,492
Are we distinguishing?

555
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:35,494
So that would say that something is I

556
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:37,496
like the point that was just made.

557
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,499
Something is salient if it reduces

558
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
uncertainty, if we're also attending to

559
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
things in order to actively construct a

560
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
niche that is consistent with our model

561
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
of the world, would we not consider that

562
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
something like that object as attracting

563
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
attention as opposed to our how do we

564
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
distinguish, I guess, between active

565
00:27:40,499 --> 00:28:06,519
sampling and attending?

566
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,522
And how is that related to salient?

567
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:15,528
So something salient either if it is

568
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:15,528
surprising or if it is serving the

569
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:15,528
purpose of kind of like fulfilling a

570
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:28,541
prediction.

571
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,543
I'm not sure I understand that kind of

572
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,544
distinction.

573
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,546
Daniel: I'm not sure that makes sense,

574
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,548
but awesome question.

575
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:39,552
And this is one reason why looking at the

576
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:39,552
formalisms and how they're framed will

577
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:39,552
help us, because in the purely English

578
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:39,552
linguistic realm, we could imagine

579
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:52,565
sentences of any type.

580
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:56,569
So in the active inference formalisms,

581
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,567
what are being tagged with salience?

582
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,569
Which variables are said to reflect

583
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:03,570
salience?

584
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,573
And then are they or in what ways are

585
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
they related to this concept of surprise,

586
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
which we're going to get to in a question

587
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:15,582
soon, versus utility?

588
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,586
And this is also speaking to the way that

589
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:19,586
expectations and preferences in active

590
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:19,586
inference are framed differently than in

591
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:27,594
certain other frameworks.

592
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:31,598
Joe: Can I jump in and just ask another

593
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:31,598
question about this question rather than

594
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:31,598
an answer, which is, wouldn't some data

595
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:40,607
be salient even if it's sensible?

596
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,610
Like we might have two levels of salience.

597
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:43,610
.

598
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,612
So I just put this quote in about the

599
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
notion of a, umvelt being a more or less

600
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
broad series of elements called carriers

601
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
of significance or marks, which are the

602
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:53,620
only things that interest the animal.

603
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,622
Now, interest the animal is one thing,

604
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:55,622
but even just perceiving those marks as

605
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:55,622
existing, I mean, active inference does

606
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:55,622
have room for that in terms of each agent

607
00:29:55,622 --> 00:30:03,624
having some sensory data.

608
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:07,628
So you could say, well, since I can't see

609
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
infrared light, it's not salient to me

610
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
when I'm out in a field of flowers, but a

611
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:16,637
bee can see that, I think.

612
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:17,638
It can see infrared or ultraviolet.

613
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,640
I can't remember which one.

614
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,643
So it may be a salient concept for me as

615
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:22,643
a thinking agent, but it's not one that's

616
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:22,643
salient for me when I'm navigating a

617
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:27,648
field of flowers.

618
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:28,649
Daniel: Basically.

619
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:34,655
Nice thanks for bringing in, umvelt, and

620
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:34,655
a lot of ecological psychology terms do

621
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:40,661
make their way to active.

622
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,663
And so then you brought up like levels of

623
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,665
perception and salience.

624
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:45,666
For example, there's things that are

625
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:45,666
outside of the wavelength that can be

626
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,668
perceived.

627
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:51,672
So photons are not going to be perceived

628
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
at that wavelength, but then there might

629
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
be within the visible range novel

630
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
arrangements like there's something

631
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
moving there or there might be something

632
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
that is static yet commands attention,

633
00:30:51,672 --> 00:31:07,682
like the Mona Lisa.

634
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:11,686
So what is happening when somebody's

635
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
regime of attention is fixated on static

636
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
artifact versus something where they're

637
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
being fixated on something that's rapidly

638
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
changing, like a movie mallory in the

639
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
chat you wrote, can folks recommend

640
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:30,705
papers?

641
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:33,708
So definitely people can recommend papers

642
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,710
anywhere they see fit.

643
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,712
And one place to check out is in the

644
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,714
bottom of our coda.

645
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,717
In the live streams, under the live

646
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:42,717
stream tab, you'll find like 45 papers

647
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:42,717
that we've relatively extensively

648
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:50,725
discussed.

649
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:53,728
And so these are not like the only or the

650
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:53,728
canonical papers or anything, but there's

651
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:57,732
a lot of important ones in there.

652
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,734
So especially if you're interested in

653
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
looking at papers where people in the lab

654
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
might have familiarity or there's some

655
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
things to listen to or watch about it,

656
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
then these are some good places to start.

657
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:09,738
.

658
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,744
All right, awesome.

659
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,745
Next question.

660
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:22,751
All right, this is a contextualization

661
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
question.

662
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:25,754
This is not a metadata contextualizing

663
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:26,755
sentence.

664
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,757
On page nine and ten they talk about

665
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,759
differences from alternative frameworks.

666
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,762
For example, in contrast with other

667
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
frameworks, policy selection in active

668
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
inference automatically balances

669
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:39,768
exploration and exploitation.

670
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,770
And later, active inference extends the

671
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
inferential approach to domains of

672
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,775
cognition that are rarely considered.

673
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:49,778
What are five to seven examples, names in

674
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:49,778
a sentence of other theories and

675
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:49,778
frameworks that active inference improves

676
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:56,785
upon or updates.

677
00:32:58,787 --> 00:32:59,788
Anyone can raise their hand.

678
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:02,785
This is an excellent homework

679
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
collaborative stigma gqueston because

680
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
even if each person only thought of one

681
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
novel answer here with a link and a name

682
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
or somebody improved what somebody else

683
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
had already brought very quickly as a

684
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
textbook group, we could have quite a

685
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:25,808
coherent and comprehensive list.

686
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:32,815
The idea of balancing exploration and

687
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
exploitation, so called, is going to be a

688
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:36,819
key theme.

689
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,823
And the way that active inference does

690
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:40,823
handle this trade off, not through the

691
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:40,823
use of an exploratory mode or

692
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:40,823
exploitative mode or some parameter that

693
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:52,835
is like governing the handoff.

694
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:56,838
There like some sort of x times

695
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
exploration plus one minus x of

696
00:33:56,838 --> 00:34:00,837
exploitation.

697
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,841
That is like one approach that's commonly

698
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:04,841
used, but it would be a question of which

699
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:04,841
citations use that type of an approach

700
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:04,841
and it's going to come to the epistemic

701
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:16,853
and pragmatic value.

702
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:19,856
Whereas when there's little epistemic

703
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:19,856
value to be gleaned, little informational

704
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:19,856
uncertainty to resolve, then pragmatic

705
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:19,856
value can be pursued, which is reducing

706
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:19,856
the surprise about outcomes in

707
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:34,871
relationship to preferences.

708
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:38,875
And then on the other hand, when there's

709
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:38,875
a lot of uncertainty, exploratory

710
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:38,875
behavior might be engaged in because

711
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:38,875
there isn't enough certainty around how

712
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:49,885
to pursue those pragmatic aims.

713
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,888
And these are going to come into play

714
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:51,888
with the Tmaz mouse model that's going to

715
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:56,893
be later in the book.

716
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:58,895
But this is a great question.

717
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:01,892
So anyone want to just give an example of

718
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:01,892
some other theory or framework or some

719
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:01,892
other approach to thinking about

720
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:07,898
exploration exploitation?

721
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:24,915
One starting reading, if anyone is

722
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:24,915
interested, there is a 2015 paper that is

723
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:24,915
looking at exploration and exploitation

724
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:31,922
trade offs in different domains.

725
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
Ali.

726
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,930
Ali: Well, I don't know if it necessarily

727
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
improves upon, but certainly an

728
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
alternative approach to this theory can

729
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
be Steven Grossberg's art theory, the

730
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
adaptive resonance theory that we talked

731
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:56,947
about previous session.

732
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:00,945
In that theory, the problem of learning

733
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
and cognition is attacked from the

734
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
viewpoint of solving the stability

735
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:10,955
plasticity dilemma.

736
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:14,959
And in this context, in the context of

737
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
art or adaptive resonance theory, well or

738
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
let's say the difference between the

739
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
active imprint one of the main

740
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
differences between the active imperence

741
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
or any predictive coding schemes from

742
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
adaptive resonance theory is that in

743
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
Bayesian models generally, the fully

744
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
suppressive matching circuits I mean, the

745
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
the circuits that can propagate the

746
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:53,998
information.

747
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,002
It cannot solve the stability plasticity

748
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
dilemma as opposed to the art or adaptive

749
00:36:57,002 --> 00:37:03,002
Bresnan's theory.

750
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:10,009
Daniel: So plasticity being more

751
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,009
exploratory and openness to updates and

752
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,009
stability being more like parametric lock

753
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,009
in more exploitative within a certain

754
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:21,020
realm.

755
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,024
Ali: Yeah, the plasticity refers to a

756
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:25,024
system that doesn't have catastrophic

757
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:31,030
forgetfulness.

758
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:43,042
Daniel: Awesome cool.

759
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,044
So we can just have this question up and

760
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:47,046
check back and people can add things.

761
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:50,049
We'll just look at a few more questions.

762
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:54,053
So on page eight they write the high road

763
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:54,053
perspective is useful to understand the

764
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:54,053
normative nature of active inference,

765
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:54,053
what the living organisms must do to face

766
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:54,053
their fundamental existential challenges.

767
00:37:54,053 --> 00:38:08,061
.

768
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:09,062
Minimize free energy.

769
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:11,064
And why?

770
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:14,067
The what and the why in the high road why

771
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
to vicariously minimize the surprise of

772
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:19,072
their sensory observations?

773
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:22,075
What does it mean to minimize surprise

774
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:23,076
vicariously?

775
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:26,079
So someone has written interesting choice

776
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,080
of words.

777
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,082
Here are two possible answers.

778
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:31,084
Also, the authors or the readers

779
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
participants may have something else in

780
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:34,087
mind.

781
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:36,089
Vicarious might refer to the point on

782
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:36,089
page six that agents cannot tractably

783
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:36,089
minimize surprise as the authors

784
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:36,089
technically defined it in chapter two

785
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:44,097
coming up.

786
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,099
So instead they're going to minimize an

787
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:46,099
approximation to surprise, which is

788
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,103
variational free energy.

789
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,106
However, I'm not sure if they're

790
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
referring to the two types of surprise

791
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
that are going to be approached in

792
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
chapter two, which is the marginal

793
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
surprise like informational surprise and

794
00:38:53,106 --> 00:39:06,113
then the Bayesian surprise or both.

795
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:10,117
So one option is surprise as defined one

796
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:10,117
way or the other, or both cannot be

797
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:10,117
directly calculated or it's not tractable

798
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:18,125
to pursue.

799
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:21,128
And so the vicarious could mean like

800
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,130
indirect or via a proxy.

801
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,132
And in that case something like

802
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
variational free energy is being

803
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
vicariously minimized and then that is

804
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
going to be used to get at the surprise

805
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
minimization and the second option the

806
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
person has written vicarious might refer

807
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
to the point that agents minimize free

808
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
energy not only in response to real

809
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
sensory observations, but in anticipation

810
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:44,151
of them.

811
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,153
Those anticipations could come from

812
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:46,153
internal simulations, by subroutines or

813
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:46,153
other modules, or memory from recall of

814
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:53,160
past observed events.

815
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:57,164
Page 32, which is probably in chapter two.

816
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
.

817
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:59,166
The author seemed to be referring to

818
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
engaging models vicariously in a

819
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
counterfactual sense, dealing with

820
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
imagined surprise at presumed

821
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:05,166
observations.

822
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:09,170
So these are really important comments.

823
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:19,180
We have the indirect minimization of

824
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,182
surprise using a proxy.

825
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,185
So some type of heuristic to minimizing

826
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:25,186
surprise now.

827
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:30,190
And so that is vicarious but contemporary.

828
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,190
.

829
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:34,195
And then the second sense is whether we'

830
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:34,195
're using a proxy or not is referring to

831
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:34,195
observations that haven't occurred so

832
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:46,207
anticipated or expected observations.

833
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:00,215
Hopefully we'll come back to in chapter

834
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
two.

835
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:04,219
But these are important questions and it'

836
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:04,219
's going to speak to like variational

837
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:04,219
free energy and expected free energy and

838
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:04,219
free energy of the expected future, a few

839
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:13,228
other constructs.

840
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:18,233
Steven and yeah, I put that last comment

841
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:18,233
in.

842
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:21,236
Steven: I was just thinking that should

843
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:22,237
probably go under number two there.

844
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:26,241
I guess that would be evidence of that

845
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:27,242
second interpretation.

846
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:29,244
Daniel: Thank you.

847
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:36,251
So we'll maybe return to this in chapter

848
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:37,252
two.

849
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:40,255
Okay, let's just see if we can look up

850
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:41,256
just a few of these questions.

851
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:43,258
It's awesome, like how many there are and

852
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:43,258
of course anyone can always read and

853
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:47,262
contribute asynchronously.

854
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:52,267
All right, the subtitle of the book is

855
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
the free energy principle in Mind, Brain

856
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:57,272
and Behavior.

857
00:41:57,272 --> 00:42:00,269
What is the relevant distinction between

858
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
mind and brain in the context of the free

859
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:03,272
energy principle?

860
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,284
Someone has written really appreciate how

861
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
the researchers have started proposing

862
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
biological implementations of Active in

863
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:20,289
the brain.

864
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,291
But it's not clear to me how this maps

865
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
onto related psychological concepts like

866
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
colloquial, surprise predictions,

867
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:28,297
salience, arousal.

868
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:29,298
Yeah, awesome.

869
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:32,301
And there's been some recent work and

870
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:32,301
some work that we're going to be looking

871
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:32,301
at in Live Stream 46 on active inference

872
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:32,301
and folk psychology about connecting some

873
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:32,301
of the formalisms to folk psychological

874
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:45,314
concepts.

875
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:48,317
So that's one place we'll be looking at

876
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:49,318
that.

877
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:56,325
But how does or does active approach this

878
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:59,328
mind brain question?

879
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:04,327
Whether the Cartesian dualist question,

880
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:04,327
hard problem of consciousness,

881
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:10,333
intentional stance of dennett.

882
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:26,349
Why is the subtitle of the book that way,

883
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:29,352
Jessica?

884
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:31,354
And then anyone else with the raised

885
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:31,354
hand?

886
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:32,355
Jessica: Yes.

887
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:35,358
I mean, I don't know the answer, but if I

888
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:35,358
make a guess, I think maybe the mind will

889
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:35,358
be more the cognition and the brain

890
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:35,358
looking at the physiology and then

891
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:47,370
looking at behaviors.

892
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,371
That would be my guess.

893
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
Daniel: Yeah.

894
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:54,377
Awesome.

895
00:43:56,379 --> 00:44:00,377
Bacterium does not have a brain, but does

896
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:02,379
it have a mind also?

897
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:03,380
Great questions.

898
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,382
We'll just continue just these questions

899
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:05,382
with fewer upvotes because there's a

900
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:10,387
bunch just so we can get them in.

901
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,390
So generative model is used in the

902
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:13,390
singular or is used in the singular as in

903
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,395
the generative model or in the.

904
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:21,398
Plural, as in hierarchical generative

905
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:22,399
models.

906
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,402
Is a generative model composed of

907
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:26,403
generative models?

908
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
I e.

909
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:28,405
Is it structurally fractal?

910
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:33,410
Someone has written personally, I think

911
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,411
the answer is yes.

912
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:37,414
Or it's possible to answer yes via

913
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:37,414
referencing a paper that talks about

914
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:37,414
blankets of blankets, Markov Blankets

915
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:42,419
life.

916
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:46,423
This paper definitely does think about

917
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:46,423
the nesting of multi scale complex

918
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:46,423
systems in terms of nested generative

919
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:46,423
models that then are constituting yes,

920
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:46,423
that are then constituting generative

921
00:44:46,423 --> 00:45:06,437
models at a higher level.

922
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,439
So, like, there's people with their

923
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
generative model and then the team has a

924
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,442
generative model of a different type.

925
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:16,447
J-F: JF yes, but even an individual

926
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:16,447
myself yourself, can be characterized as

927
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:16,447
having a generative model composed of

928
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:16,447
other general models dealing with less

929
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:33,464
abstract umvelt, for example.

930
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,469
So I think yes, I think almost trivially

931
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
in the sense of a collective, but in the

932
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
sense of an individual, does an

933
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
individual also can be said to possess a

934
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
generative model that is itself composed

935
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:53,484
of sub generative models?

936
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,487
Daniel: Awesome point.

937
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,489
And we've in several live streams and

938
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,485
settings discussed.

939
00:46:00,485 --> 00:46:03,488
Like, there's one sense where nesting is

940
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
used to refer to systems that are

941
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:08,493
potentially even physically nested.

942
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:11,496
And then we also see the nesting

943
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:12,497
architecture.

944
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:16,501
For example, here it's live stream number

945
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,503
25 when we discussed it.

946
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:22,507
But this is a nesting of attentional and

947
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:23,508
cognitive models.

948
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:27,512
So this is even of a so called individual.

949
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:27,512
.

950
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:31,516
So what is it about model nesting when

951
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:31,516
sometimes it can refer to physical

952
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:31,516
enclosure and other times it is something

953
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:31,516
that enables counterfactual reasoning,

954
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:43,528
attention and metacognition.

955
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:46,531
So what is the nesting?

956
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,533
And if someone is just seeing this kind

957
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
of a notation or this kind of a graph for

958
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
the first time, we're going to totally go

959
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:53,538
into it.

960
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:56,541
But it's going to be one of the core

961
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:57,541
formalisms.

962
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,544
And also this paper is going to deal with

963
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:00,539
nested models and other papers do.

964
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,543
The textbook is going to spend almost all

965
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,545
the time on just one level.

966
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:09,548
So just sort of the kernel or the essence

967
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:09,548
or the archetype or the essential motif

968
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:09,548
of this partially observable Markov

969
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:15,554
decision process.

970
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:17,556
And the textbook is going to focus on

971
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
juxtaposing the discrete time partially

972
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
observable Markov decision process with a

973
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:24,563
continuous time.

974
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:28,567
But it will deal less with hierarchical

975
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:28,567
nesting.

976
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:31,570
But it does bring it up, but it's not

977
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
going to be focused on, okay, what is the

978
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:37,576
information content of a prediction?

979
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:39,578
I'm just going to read these ones just so

980
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
that those who are listening can see the

981
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
kinds of questions that they could be

982
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:44,583
adding or addressing.

983
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:47,586
This question has to do with the

984
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
relationship between active inference and

985
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
pleasant surprises, potentially even love

986
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
languages receiving money on the pavement.

987
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:55,594
.

988
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:59,598
Page five is speaking to the author's

989
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
rhetoric around theory proliferation and

990
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
integration where basically they are

991
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
saying well, we could have a dedicated

992
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
explanation for every neurotransmitter,

993
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
for every synaptic junction, every unique

994
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
behavior, every cognitive phenomena or we

995
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
could somehow utilize first principles,

996
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
whatever those are, to result in theory

997
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:23,616
integration.

998
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:26,619
And that gets mapped onto the scruffies

999
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:27,620
and the needs.

1000
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:33,626
Is it really helpful to redefine terms

1001
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
such as probability and surprise to

1002
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
sometimes mean utility and divergence

1003
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
from utility if that's what the authors

1004
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:41,634
are doing?

1005
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:43,636
There appears to be an unhealthy

1006
00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:45,638
ambiguity in how they use these terms.

1007
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,641
This is where the formalisms are going to

1008
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:49,642
really come into play.

1009
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:55,648
And also the live stream on Free Energy A

1010
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:55,648
User's Guide 37 deals with this dual

1011
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:55,648
interpretation of expectations and

1012
00:48:55,648 --> 00:49:05,652
preferences.

1013
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:08,655
And this is like one of the most

1014
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
essential differences between active

1015
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
inference and reward learning or

1016
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
reinforcement learning frameworks is a

1017
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
dual deployment of the same variable in

1018
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
formalisms to represent preferred states

1019
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
as well as expected states like

1020
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
homeostatic range is expected and

1021
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:28,675
preferred.

1022
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,677
It's where one wants to be found and it's

1023
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,679
where one expects to be found.

1024
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,682
And so one can realize those preferences

1025
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:35,682
by reducing their surprise about the

1026
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:35,682
observations rather than saying, well,

1027
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:35,682
homeostatic states are valuable and we're

1028
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:44,691
going to pursue maximum value.

1029
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:50,697
How might an acceptable state space

1030
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,699
relate to the idea of a comfort zone?

1031
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,701
It seems the acceptable state space for

1032
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
an organism is necessary for it to

1033
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
persist, whereas a comfort zone seems to

1034
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
be a less necessary state repertoire

1035
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
which if exceeded, may only indicate to

1036
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
an organism that it's at risk of leaving

1037
00:49:54,701 --> 00:50:07,708
the acceptable state space.

1038
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:09,710
Interesting.

1039
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:12,713
And then the last written question here,

1040
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,715
looking ahead into part two.

1041
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:16,717
Have people been looking into the

1042
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
computational complexity of the active

1043
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
inference model and how far are we in

1044
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
terms of making this computable and the

1045
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
reference 2019 paper computational

1046
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
Resource Demands of the Predictive

1047
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:29,730
Bayesian Brain?

1048
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:36,737
Excellent and important question to

1049
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
understand, like the analytical

1050
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
computational complexity, like the Big O

1051
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
notation, does nesting a model make it

1052
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
two or is it log the number of levels or

1053
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
is it number of levels to the sum

1054
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:49,750
exponent?

1055
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,754
And then also in practice, like using

1056
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:53,754
active block for instance, or Pi MDP,

1057
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:53,754
what is the actual runtime of different

1058
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:59,760
algorithms?

1059
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:03,758
So this is awesome with the questions

1060
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:06,761
that everyone's added to one.

1061
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,763
We're going to keep on returning to

1062
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
chapter one, just like we're going to

1063
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
keep on returning to the ideas, but

1064
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
people can fold it and continue to add to

1065
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
two and to the appendices which we're

1066
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:18,773
going to go to next week.

1067
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:21,776
So just as a reminder, next week we're

1068
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
going to be approaching appendix A and B,

1069
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:26,781
which are mathematical.

1070
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:28,783
And so just a few thoughts on that before

1071
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:30,785
we return back to the ideas on the book.

1072
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:33,788
In appendix A, you can see that all the

1073
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:36,791
equations have already been added.

1074
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:40,794
So if anyone wants to reference, what

1075
00:51:40,794 --> 00:51:42,797
does equation A point 44 mean?

1076
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:45,800
And obviously like there's 60 equations

1077
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,802
and you could get your PH.

1078
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:47,802
D.

1079
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:50,805
Learning about some sub function of just

1080
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:51,805
one.

1081
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:53,808
So we're just trying to familiarize and

1082
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:54,809
get a first coat of paint.

1083
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:57,811
So for those with different mathematical

1084
00:51:57,811 --> 00:51:57,812
backgrounds.

1085
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:01,810
If somebody can derive the proof, amazing.

1086
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:01,810
.

1087
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,812
Let's take some notes on it.

1088
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:05,814
And if somebody is just going to be

1089
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:05,814
asking beginner questions that's also

1090
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:08,817
very important.

1091
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:11,820
So that will be in next week's questions

1092
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,821
and discussions.

1093
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:15,824
But let's just look at what ideas people

1094
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:15,824
wrote and then see if there's any ideas

1095
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:18,827
percolating.

1096
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:21,830
So having addressed some specific

1097
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
uncertainties I get with the questions we

1098
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
can think about what are some impressions

1099
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
that people were having and what was

1100
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:33,842
exciting ideas.

1101
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:38,847
So if Ben or Mike want to speak to this

1102
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
or if anybody else wants to share

1103
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
something JF and then anyone else JF and

1104
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:48,857
then Ben or is your hand raised?

1105
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:50,859
J-F: No, my hand was not raised.

1106
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:51,860
Daniel: Okay.

1107
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:51,860
Sorry, Ben.

1108
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,861
Go for it.

1109
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:54,863
Ben: Yeah, thanks.

1110
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:55,864
Can you hear me?

1111
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:55,864
Daniel: Yes.

1112
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
Ben: Cool.

1113
00:52:57,865 --> 00:52:57,866
Daniel: Yeah.

1114
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:58,867
Ben: Maybe I should have posed this as a

1115
00:52:58,867 --> 00:52:58,867
question.

1116
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:00,863
Actually I just thought it was

1117
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:00,863
interesting, this connection between

1118
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:00,863
perception and learning as essentially

1119
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:00,863
the same process unfolding over different

1120
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:09,872
timescales.

1121
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:11,874
Because on the one hand, this makes sense

1122
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
to me because one example of learning

1123
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
might be you can imagine an agent moving

1124
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
to a new city with which they're

1125
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
completely unfamiliar and the agent could

1126
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
sit at a fixed point in the city or walk

1127
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
around the city and just perceive the

1128
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
city and they would learn over a longer

1129
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:28,891
time scale.

1130
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:31,894
They would observe certain regularities

1131
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:31,894
or certain occurrences and clearly that's

1132
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:34,897
one form of learning.

1133
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:37,900
But then there's maybe another example

1134
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:37,900
where my mathematical background is

1135
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,904
fairly weak.

1136
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:44,907
And so if I were to try and learn the

1137
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:44,907
kind of fundamentals of the equations

1138
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:44,907
that we were just looking at no matter

1139
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:44,907
how for how long I kind of perceive those

1140
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:54,917
equations I'm not going to learn them.

1141
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,919
I have no access to kind, there's no

1142
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:58,921
information gained there.

1143
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:00,917
It seems like to learn certain things we

1144
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:00,917
need to scaffold perception in certain

1145
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:03,920
ways.

1146
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,923
And I suppose my question would be when

1147
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
somebody teaches us something that we don'

1148
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
't understand, is that merely a kind of

1149
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
scaffolded perception or is that kind of

1150
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
learning underwritten by distinct

1151
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
cognitive processing completely separate

1152
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:20,937
from perception?

1153
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:24,941
Daniel: Great question, thanks for

1154
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:25,942
unpacking that.

1155
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:28,945
And to give one thought, let's imagine a

1156
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:31,948
ball moving across the visual fields.

1157
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:33,950
It seems like a canonical example of

1158
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:34,951
perception.

1159
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:37,954
We're perceiving the ball but it could

1160
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:37,954
also be understood as parameter updating

1161
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:37,954
or parameter learning of the location of

1162
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:44,961
the ball.

1163
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:47,964
And then that's one approach.

1164
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:49,966
But then also you pointed towards this

1165
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:49,966
deeper sense of learning referring to the

1166
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:49,966
underlying structures like in the ball

1167
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:55,972
movement examples.

1168
00:54:55,972 --> 00:54:58,974
It seems like learning and perception are

1169
00:54:58,974 --> 00:54:58,974
the same but then learning might also

1170
00:54:58,974 --> 00:54:58,974
refer to something deeper like the

1171
00:54:58,974 --> 00:55:04,975
tendencies of how balls move.

1172
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:08,979
Or one could, as probably many of us have,

1173
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:08,979
, look at these symbols and perceive them

1174
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:12,983
visually.

1175
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:15,986
But because we wouldn't have learnt the

1176
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:15,986
underlying generative model that gives

1177
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:15,986
rise to these pixels, we could

1178
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:22,993
continually be surprised.

1179
00:55:23,994 --> 00:55:25,996
So what is happening when there's

1180
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
perception and learning seemingly

1181
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:29,000
happening hand in hand.

1182
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,002
And then other times where somebody's

1183
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:31,002
speaking a language you don't understand,

1184
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:34,005
you certainly hear it.

1185
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:36,007
You may even be paying attention to it,

1186
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:36,007
yet the next phoneme may still

1187
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:40,011
continually surprise you.

1188
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:42,013
So it's a really important question.

1189
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:51,022
Then Mike wrote yes, please.

1190
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:52,023
Go for it, Mike.

1191
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:54,025
Mike: Yeah, so I think these are

1192
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:54,025
straightforward but foundational concepts

1193
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:54,025
that the dependence of sensory input on

1194
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:54,025
action and vice versa creates a framework

1195
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:54,025
where we can have feedback and then the

1196
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:54,025
mathematical constructs let us think

1197
00:55:54,025 --> 00:56:11,036
about how we model that and simulate it.

1198
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:13,038
Daniel: Thanks for this.

1199
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,041
Also, a central point in active inference,

1200
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
, there isn't a perception and inference

1201
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
module that passes the perceptions to the

1202
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
learning module, and the learning module

1203
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
passes it to the decision making module

1204
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
and the decision making module to the

1205
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:26,051
action model.

1206
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,054
The inference is conditioned upon policy

1207
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
selection and action, and that is going

1208
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
to approach this nexus of perception,

1209
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
cognition and action in an integrated way

1210
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
that not that may differ from other

1211
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
frameworks, which was also to the point

1212
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:46,071
of that previous question.

1213
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:51,076
So this was an awesome session.

1214
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:54,079
Everyone really appreciated it.

1215
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,083
I'll upload the video recording following

1216
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,080
the meeting next week.

1217
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,082
At the same time, we'll be looking at

1218
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
questions and ideas from appendix A and B.

1219
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:05,084
.

1220
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:08,087
So just approach those however you'd like

1221
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:09,088
and annotate the coda.

1222
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:12,091
And also, if anybody wants to specify

1223
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:12,091
another time when they just want to

1224
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:12,091
discuss or cowork that can be added, or

1225
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:12,091
in the active lab discord, people can

1226
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:12,091
join and we can have a voice like a study

1227
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:12,091
hour or just a time to talk about stuff

1228
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:29,108
or write down the questions we have.

1229
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:32,111
So awesome work, everybody.

1230
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,112
Thanks a lot.
