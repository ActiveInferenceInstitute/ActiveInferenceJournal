1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,080
hello everyone thanks for joining the

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,359
seconds

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,319
meeting

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,440
where we're going to be discussing

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
chapter one

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,120
it's the active textbook group and it's

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,080
may 12 2022.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
you can click on my screen and that will

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
show you the full screen

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,359
we updated the live meeting page a bit

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,880
and it's

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,960
just like all these other pages a work

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,800
in progress but hopefully this will be a

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
structure where

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
we'll be able to hear everyone's

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
perspective and leave the coda in a

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,079
better place than we found it

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
so what we'll do in the live meetings

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
which from here on out

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
or at least for here for the next two

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
and a half months or so are going to be

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
like

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
driven by the material

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
in the chapters and in the appendices

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,480
we're going to go to the questions page

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
and we're gonna look at the questions

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,320
that have been asked for that week for

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
that theme

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
and we're just gonna start with the most

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
upvoted questions and then we're gonna

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
be taking notes

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
in the answers in the discourse and

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
we'll go into a little bit more detail

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
when we flip to that page

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
and then after addressing questions for

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
probably most of the time and discussing

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,880
that

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,320
we'll go

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,640
pull back a little bit more broadly like

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
ideas

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
for that

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
week um

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
and then in the last minutes we can just

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
see if there's been any changes to the

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
project ideas

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
and start to see what people are excited

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
about applying active inference to

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
and then we'll end at the top of the

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,439
hour

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
and take a quick break and then there'll

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
be a tools organizational unit meeting

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
following for those who want to just

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200
like listen or participate in dot tools

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
so let's head over to questions and i'm

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,280
going to hide the sidebar because we're

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
going to be mostly here in questions

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
okay

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
so it's awesome

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
and also control and plus minus or

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
control and scroll is like a good way to

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,758
resize how it looks

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,720
um

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
so this is our first week with this

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
format

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
and anyone's welcome to like

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
suggest a a variant or a different way

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
to carry this out but

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
um the co-organizers of the textbook

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,520
group kind of

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
thought we could

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
do something along these lines

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
the questions we're gonna be looking at

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,319
are in chapter one

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,040
so that's the chapter we're discussing

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
today

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
and we're going to start with the ones

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
that have the most upvotes in the

78
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,440
interesting

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,319
um

80
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
and just

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
spend a couple minutes on each of the

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
questions

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,239
and at any point

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,959
there are the affordances of just

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,160
listening

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,599
and also of course re-watching this

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,640
recording

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,959
there's also the affordance in gather to

89
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,280
raise your hand if you'd like to share

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,640
on that question that we're going to

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
have up

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,519
and additionally

93
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,760
in the um by clicking on the answers in

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,519
discourse

95
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,560
that will pull up like a focused view on

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
that question

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,720
and everybody can collaboratively edit

98
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
the answers in discourse and so it's

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
better to like add and be noisy even if

100
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
it's a bullet point list or an

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
incomplete sentence or there's

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
incoherence or it's contradictory those

103
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,120
are all fine

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
it just like adds information and

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
perspectives

106
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
to the question so yeah we're going to

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
go to each question

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
open up

109
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,879
the answers in discourse

110
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,440
read the question

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
see what has already been contributed in

112
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
the answers in discourse and then also

113
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
like if people want to share

114
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
other thoughts that they're having

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,920
that's awesome

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
and then also if anybody wants to be

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
like taking other notes just things that

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
are coming to mind that they don't want

119
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,959
to share

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
in a speaking way

121
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
or just taking some notes on what other

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
people are saying

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
um

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,239
so

125
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,720
let's just

126
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,560
go into it and i'll be just keeping an

127
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,079
eye for the raised hand in gather

128
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
or anybody who wants to speak so

129
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
um starting with this

130
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
first question

131
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
maybe we can have like a like addressed

132
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
during recording or something like that

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,479
but

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,600
so

135
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
how do you understand the distinction

136
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
between the high road and the low road

137
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
to active inference

138
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
what do you think is interesting or

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,759
useful about this distinction

140
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,080
so does anybody want to like just

141
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
summarize how they

142
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,199
were thinking about the high in the low

143
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,160
road or we can look at what um others

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,040
have already written here

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
what is the difference between the high

146
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
road and the low road

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
are there other roads

148
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
are there high and low roads to other

149
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
theories

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,400
what is this metaphor with the roads

151
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,280
so let's check out yes um ali and then

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,280
mallory

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
well i believe it's just um another term

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
for top-down or bottom-up approach in a

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,440
kind of way

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,160
and um well the

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
high road i believe starts uh from

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,560
the actualized mind itself and tries to

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
derive

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
the underlying mechanisms or underlying

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
principles

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
but the bottom-up approach or the

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
uh

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
in other words low road

165
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
uh tries to

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
start from

167
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
the elements

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
tries to start from the

169
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,800
unorganized elements let's say and

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
derive the higher mechanisms or higher

171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
order mechanisms

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,360
actualizing the mind itself

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,800
thank you awesome allery

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
um yeah i was just gonna

175
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,039
maybe recapitulate i guess what i wrote

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,800
in the comments and

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,319
i see now that i probably should have

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,080
written straighten the answers in

179
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
discourse section so sorry about that um

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,639
but um

181
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,199
i really appreciated this

182
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,280
schematic

183
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,319
because

184
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,840
um

185
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,280
i've read

186
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,759
papers that i think come at active

187
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
inference from both of these angles and

188
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,039
in trying to understand

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,680
i don't know the framework i think

190
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
um

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
it wasn't super clear to me how all of

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,759
these different terms that are like

193
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
really nicely outlined in this figure

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
um figure 1.2

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
um

196
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
are related to one another so just to

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,919
have it

198
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
i think

199
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,240
laid out like this it was really very

200
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
very helpful um

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
and i think um

202
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
still being kind of new to the concepts

203
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
and and such i liked the way they framed

204
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
it in terms of kind of

205
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,240
um the high road describing

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
um

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
the kind of what and why

208
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
and the low road being more about the

209
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,400
how

210
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
um

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
i thought that was really

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
um

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,599
very useful

214
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
so yeah i really i love this and i i

215
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
saved it and we'll probably reference it

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,080
quite often

217
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
yeah agreed it's it's really uh useful

218
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
and it touches on

219
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
aristotle's multiple y's

220
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,199
where some of the y's are are more like

221
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,560
hows

222
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
um or they're sort of proximate

223
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
mechanisms or more ultimate mechanisms

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
um and and we can like look at figure

225
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,919
1.2 so active inference is in the middle

226
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
and the high road i guess this is the

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
starting train stop here with a free

228
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
energy principle

229
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,120
um which

230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
some later questions also might invoke

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,159
and then it kind of goes down to active

232
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240
inference whereas starting with bayes

233
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
theorem

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,399
also gets us to

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,680
sentience

236
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
behavior

237
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
sentient being like sensing and feeling

238
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
and acting not

239
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
as much on the um

240
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
qualia and experiential side

241
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,839
um

242
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
so what else do we

243
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,399
have in the answers so high road what

244
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,080
and why

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
that is

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
starting with sort of the organismal

247
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,080
imperative or or like um ali i think

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
said there that the actualized mind and

249
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
then what are the underlying principles

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,560
that make

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
adaptive behavior adaptive behavioral

252
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
systems

253
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,440
working

254
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
down you know the castle in the sky is

255
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
the adaptive behavior and intelligent

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
cognitive behavior

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
what

258
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
is under it

259
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
and then the low road

260
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,680
doesn't begin with that imperative it

261
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,839
starts with like the elements

262
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
like the low road starting with base

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
none of these necessarily have to be or

264
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
at least maybe until you get to like

265
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
bayesian brain

266
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
these don't have to be adaptive

267
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,959
a generative model doesn't have to be

268
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,480
resisting entropy

269
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
so it's sort of like here's where we see

270
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
a lot of the elements in the machinery

271
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
and then on the top is more of the

272
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
self-organization

273
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,839
resistance to dissipation autopilosis

274
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,120
how are you going to get there you have

275
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
to be minimizing your surprise

276
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
what does that actually

277
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
entail and then active inference is like

278
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
this intermediate stop

279
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
and again maybe there's other roads or

280
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
there's other paths

281
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
um

282
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,680
yeah

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
so any other thoughts on high road and

284
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
low road or we'll continue to the next

285
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
question

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
this is just being

287
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
introduced in chapter one

288
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
because the following chapters two and

289
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
three which we're going to get to after

290
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
the appendix a and b

291
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
are going to detail the low road and the

292
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,279
high road

293
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,680
so this is kind of like a a map for some

294
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
of the next steps that we're going to be

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
engaging in

296
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
okay

297
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
next question

298
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
the concept

299
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
of organisms minimizing surprise is

300
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,079
introduced on page six

301
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,480
how are prior assumptions or beliefs

302
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
established when the organism is in new

303
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,519
or novel environments

304
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,959
so anyone can raise their hand or

305
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,239
take a note here

306
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
um

307
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,519
mallory or ali with raisins

308
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
one helpful approach might be to think

309
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,519
about like the questions asking about

310
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,079
new and novel environments so are we

311
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,360
dealing with

312
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
um categorical novelty

313
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,079
or with like quantitative novelty like i

314
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
was measuring the temperature and then

315
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,000
i'm in a new environment where the

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
temperature is different

317
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
that's one type of novelty but there

318
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
might also be like this like

319
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
novelty

320
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,839
at an even higher level with like i was

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
looking at

322
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,720
um

323
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,079
previously i was looking at temperature

324
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,639
and now i'm in a place where i'm having

325
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,320
priors about smell

326
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
so that's like a sort of intermodal

327
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
or like

328
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,079
a different

329
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,320
type of thing that's being tracked so

330
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
that's a categorical novelty

331
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,560
as opposed to

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,959
just updating the temperature parameter

333
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,399
in a different temperature room

334
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,040
whether

335
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,600
the person who asked it is here or not

336
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,920
um oh yes okay ali and mike go for it

337
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,800
uh yeah um well again if we're talking

338
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
about um

339
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
the um human mind

340
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,079
uh

341
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
i mean uh if

342
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
uh

343
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,600
from the priors

344
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
we can infer that uh well it's something

345
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
that's

346
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,160
kind of innate in human minds is

347
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
something uh wired and

348
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,480
i mean

349
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
perhaps genetically or uh in any other

350
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
biologically

351
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
hardwired way but

352
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,079
well

353
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,560
again yes the definition of novel

354
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,360
situation varies uh

355
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,519
according to

356
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
what we're exactly referring to

357
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,519
and if uh a novel situation is something

358
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,040
that the organism uh hasn't

359
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,839
uh ever presented with uh well in that

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,040
case uh these prior

361
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,519
these priors or these innate tendencies

362
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,480
won't

363
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880
help it very much so in that case

364
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,360
it should probably go

365
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,040
along the

366
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
way of

367
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,959
constructing

368
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,040
posteriors more actively i believe than

369
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,560
in any regular situation

370
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,000
thank you ali

371
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
uh jessica

372
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,639
and then mike and then steve

373
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
hi um i think

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,279
maybe like in this situation even though

375
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,880
the um

376
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
the agent might be encountering

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
something that has an experience before

378
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,279
they might use something as proxy that

379
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,040
they already know

380
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,199
and sort of like project

381
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
those understanding into

382
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
that new situation and then it's through

383
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
action etc then they're gonna be

384
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,079
updating like okay how true is it or

385
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,120
isn't

386
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,360
to what they understand but they might

387
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,199
be making some kind of projection based

388
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
on what they already know and things

389
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,240
that look similar to that new experience

390
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
awesome thank you uh mike and stephen

391
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
yeah i was just gonna comment um

392
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
in the case where the organism is brand

393
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
new and has no experience um

394
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,399
i think ali's comments cover this a bit

395
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,800
that it will have to be updating its

396
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,759
priors fairly rapidly and

397
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,560
presumably starting with sort of a wider

398
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,560
distribution

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,120
great stephen

400
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,240
yes along the lines of what jessica was

401
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,199
saying

402
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,160
there

403
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,880
has been some work in systematizing that

404
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
as case-based reasoning

405
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,399
not necessarily in a

406
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
bayesian framework here

407
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
but as a

408
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,839
derivative of expert systems

409
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,680
where

410
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
when you get a

411
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,079
new scenario you try to match that

412
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
against previous scenarios that you've

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,199
already seen and adapted

414
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,000
however necessary to

415
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
meet the new observations

416
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,639
so that might be a place to look for

417
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,839
uh inspiration

418
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,639
thanks

419
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
yeah and in in the

420
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,839
ontology work and in a lot of these

421
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
questions there's often like a narrow

422
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,959
answer and then a broader answer like

423
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,360
the narrow answer would be well again if

424
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,240
all your bayesian model is doing

425
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
is looking at the thermometer reading

426
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
and then doing a column and filter and

427
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
inferring the temperature in the room

428
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
well then the answer of what happens

429
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
when you put it under water or what

430
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
happens when you ask it to predict scent

431
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
it's kind of like a trivial answer which

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
is it's just not a parameter in that

433
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,799
script

434
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
nothing happens

435
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
and then that's like the narrower answer

436
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,839
which is

437
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,400
often very deflationary or like very

438
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,679
trivial

439
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,640
answers

440
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,959
and then there's also a broader question

441
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,200
like in the ecological context or in the

442
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
organismal context in the expert applied

443
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
context

444
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,440
what happens when there are these

445
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
different qualitative and quantitative

446
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
types of novelty

447
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,679
and so sometimes it's like

448
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,480
um

449
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,160
there we are in the middle again with

450
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,120
the deflationary or the narrow being too

451
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,280
obvious and too simple to be brought

452
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,559
into action

453
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,960
and then the bigger question like how do

454
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,480
experts

455
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
in medicine or

456
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,919
some other field how do they handle

457
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
different types of novelty is like

458
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
that's its own

459
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,639
research question and agenda

460
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
awesome

461
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
any other thoughts on this question

462
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,360
about

463
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,760
priors and it's also very important note

464
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,880
that surprise is always relative to

465
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
expectations

466
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
which are priors in the bayesian context

467
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
and those are granted by the generative

468
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,679
model so surprise is not just free

469
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,720
floating it's in relationship to the

470
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
outcomes as expected by an organism for

471
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,039
example jessica your hands raised

472
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,919
otherwise we'll go to the next question

473
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
awesome

474
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
okay this question i think is pretty

475
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,360
similar to the previous

476
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
um one so if anybody wants to give a

477
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
thought otherwise no worries

478
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,880
are the high road low road the only

479
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
roads to active inference or my active

480
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
be like rome

481
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,200
which i guess we can unpack a little bit

482
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,840
many slash all roads leading to it

483
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
um jf

484
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,160
yes that's more of a general question uh

485
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
uh

486
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
if for example if what you're trying to

487
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,799
understand is race cars right and you

488
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,840
develop a mathematical framework a given

489
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
number of measurements like the the

490
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
weight of the car the length of the car

491
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
the torque of the engine the adhesion of

492
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
the tires the friction and whatnot

493
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
you're able to predict how well the the

494
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,960
race car is going to perform in

495
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,520
different conditions and whatnot

496
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,039
does that mean that you're an expert in

497
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
race cars does that explain the race car

498
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,919
could you engineer a race car

499
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
based on this knowledge so

500
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,880
talking about multiple the different

501
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,360
roads um

502
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
one road through the free energy

503
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
principle i think is an analytical

504
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
uh road

505
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,039
that looks at

506
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,640
the outcomes

507
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
of the

508
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,360
the machinery of the uh the living

509
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,360
beings that try to maintain homeostasis

510
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
but how much does it say about the

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
implementation

512
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
of those

513
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,080
organisms

514
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
it says

515
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
many things but does it say everything

516
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,520
that we deem

517
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,799
might deem interesting

518
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
so what are the limitations of of this

519
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
this this uh

520
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,799
framework the the

521
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,080
the the active inference framework uh

522
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,760
defined by the free energy principle

523
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
what are its limitations

524
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
on top of what it the

525
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
given its capabilities which are which

526
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
are i think uh enormous but there are

527
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
limitations and and if there are

528
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,799
limitations that means there are there

529
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
must be other roads

530
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
that

531
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,799
can be taken

532
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,320
to

533
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,240
circumvent these limitations

534
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,720
thank you great comment ali

535
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,960
uh well

536
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,159
delusion gathering in a thousand

537
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,320
plateaus

538
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
has

539
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,960
laid out um the concept of rhizome i

540
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
don't know if you're familiar with the

541
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,440
concept of rhizome as opposed to

542
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,919
an arborescence structure

543
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
well

544
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,640
basically the concept of rhizome

545
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
uh expounds a

546
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,559
structure and now a knowledge structure

547
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,080
in which every concept can potentially

548
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,640
be connected to every other concept

549
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
without having to go through a principle

550
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
uh trunk

551
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,960
of a knowledge struct a knowledge tree

552
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
let's say but uh in an arborescent

553
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,400
structure and not arborescens knowledge

554
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
structure

555
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,720
everything branches off from a principal

556
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,760
trunk from a principle

557
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,520
uh let's say

558
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,559
uh

559
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,480
and i believe that in active imprints uh

560
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
a rhizomatic approach can also be

561
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,559
uh

562
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,919
explored

563
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,520
and

564
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,039
i mean

565
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
not only by

566
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,080
uh

567
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,840
approaching uh

568
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
to different concepts via the uh

569
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,480
high road or the low road

570
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
main or principal trunk

571
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,080
it can potentially be approached from

572
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,439
uh seemingly unrelated concepts too

573
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,039
awesome like to

574
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,280
maybe even approach a limitation or a

575
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
seemingly unrelated concept

576
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
both the high and the low road in this

577
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,640
textbook

578
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
are formal and they're both grounded in

579
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
like mathematical symbols

580
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,400
so are there qualitative

581
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
or

582
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,159
non-mathematical

583
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,919
roads

584
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,880
maybe

585
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,919
some of the early roads are mathematical

586
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,799
but

587
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
is it possible that a future

588
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,000
road or path or tunnel or

589
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,840
choose your travel metaphor might not be

590
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
that case

591
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,159
and then and then thanks for sharing

592
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
that um the resource there

593
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,240
because um this is another interesting

594
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,280
angle

595
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,990
which um

596
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,360
[Music]

597
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
various people have traced this

598
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,360
evolution of visual metaphor

599
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
where it's like things are ladder-like

600
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,799
and scalar

601
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
and then there's more of a bifurcating

602
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,760
tree

603
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
and then that becomes

604
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
um critiqued or complexified into more

605
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
of a network

606
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,960
like

607
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
with introgression among species for

608
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
example so there's sort of this movement

609
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,440
from

610
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,720
linear

611
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
through a tree like a directed acyclic

612
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,799
graph towards something that's more

613
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
networked

614
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,440
so

615
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,080
that's um a lot of interesting

616
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
ideas anything else that people want to

617
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,559
add or we'll continue on

618
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
okay

619
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,520
on page 10 they write creatures engaging

620
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,600
in active inference actively seek out

621
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
salient sensory observations that

622
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
resolve their uncertainty

623
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,559
so

624
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,159
what is the relationship between

625
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,799
salience in the kind of observation that

626
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,799
reduces uncertainty

627
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,840
why is the relationship between salience

628
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,559
observation and uncertainty this way

629
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
how does active inference frame this

630
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,400
relationship similarly or different from

631
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,000
which other specific frameworks

632
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,360
so someone wrote

633
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,200
i like this question a lot eager to get

634
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
a better understanding of what

635
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,640
constitutes salience

636
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
is salience referencing information that

637
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,520
is self-evidence or information that is

638
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,880
precise and surprising or dot dot dot

639
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
yes i think um

640
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,279
attention and salience

641
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,640
is addressed more in papers on active

642
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,039
inference

643
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,279
than at least just from a preliminary

644
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,400
pass of the book so attention and

645
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,320
metacognitive mechanisms are not going

646
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,279
to be

647
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,320
um

648
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,919
a core

649
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,960
feature

650
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,159
in the book however there's again been a

651
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,520
lot of interesting work on like the

652
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,360
neurobiology and the

653
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
computational aspects of salience and

654
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
attention

655
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,919
we can click on the word and and see

656
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,840
a definition but this is not like the

657
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
final definition this is just what

658
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
some have gotten to salience is the

659
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,240
extent to which a cue or an observation

660
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
commands the attention of an agent given

661
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,159
their regime of attention so potentially

662
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,720
a little bit taught logical

663
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,080
like a salient

664
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
observation is something that is

665
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
grabbing attention a salient cue is

666
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,170
something that commands attention steven

667
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,120
[Music]

668
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,080
yes i would say that especially if we're

669
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
defining it in

670
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,720
that way that there are

671
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,880
two elements to salience and one is what

672
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
was

673
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,039
pointed out in the question i guess that

674
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,360
you are reducing

675
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,799
uncertainty

676
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
but there is also the question of what

677
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
uncertainty is worth reducing

678
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,960
and that gets into

679
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,080
utility and where

680
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
where it makes sense to explore

681
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,880
i don't know if we want to

682
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
choose to change the definition of

683
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,840
salience to just be the second of those

684
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
or leave it as having both of those

685
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,320
elements

686
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
thanks

687
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,600
mallory

688
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,240
um i think something i don't necessarily

689
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,960
understand um which i would appreciate

690
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
maybe somebody speaking to a little bit

691
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,440
is um

692
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,080
this is related actually to a question i

693
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,919
put in earlier about the distinction

694
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,279
between

695
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,480
um

696
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,399
perception and learning but um

697
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,320
something that grabs attention

698
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,880
are we distinguishing so that would say

699
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,159
that something is

700
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,360
like the point that was just made

701
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
something is salient if it reduces

702
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,399
uncertainty

703
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,039
um if we're also

704
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,600
attending to things in order to actively

705
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,919
construct a niche that is consistent

706
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,200
with

707
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,480
um

708
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,360
our

709
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
model of the world

710
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
would

711
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
would we not consider that

712
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
something

713
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,799
like that object as attracting attention

714
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,120
as opposed to art like how do we

715
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
distinguish a guess between active

716
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,039
sampling and attending

717
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,080
um

718
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
and how is that related to salient so

719
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,279
something salient either if it

720
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,320
um

721
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,279
is

722
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,039
surprising

723
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,480
or

724
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,919
if it is

725
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,720
like um

726
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,880
serving the

727
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
purpose of kind of like fulfilling a

728
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,679
prediction i i'm not sure i understand

729
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,440
that kind of distinction i'm not sure

730
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,679
that makes sense but

731
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,520
awesome question

732
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
and

733
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
this is one reason why

734
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
looking at the formalisms and how

735
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,279
they're framed will help us because in

736
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
the purely

737
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
english linguistic realm

738
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,000
we could

739
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,240
imagine sentences

740
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,200
of any

741
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,320
type

742
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,480
so in the active inference formalisms

743
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,640
what what are being tagged with salience

744
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,559
which variables are said to reflect

745
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,520
salience and then are they

746
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,720
um or in what ways are they

747
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,960
related to this concept of surprise

748
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,240
which we're going to get to in a

749
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
question soon

750
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,039
versus

751
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,320
utility

752
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,640
and this is also speaking to

753
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
the way that expectations and

754
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,520
preferences

755
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,919
in active inference are framed

756
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,000
differently than in certain other

757
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
frameworks

758
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
um can i jump in and just ask another

759
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,159
question about this question rather than

760
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,200
an answer which is um

761
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,720
wouldn't some data be salient

762
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,039
if if it's even if it's sensible like we

763
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
might have two levels of salience

764
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,679
so i just put this quote in about the

765
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,159
notion of a umvelt being a more or less

766
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,559
broad series of elements called carries

767
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,000
of significance or marks which are the

768
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
only things that interest the animal now

769
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,600
interest the animal is one thing but

770
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
even just perceiving those marks as

771
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
existing i mean active inference does

772
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,520
have room for that in terms of each

773
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,000
agent having some sensory data so you

774
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,399
could say well since i can't see

775
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
uh infrared light

776
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
it's not salient to me

777
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
when i'm out in a field of flowers but a

778
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
bee

779
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,760
can see that

780
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,279
i think it's you can see all infrared or

781
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,640
ultraviolet i came over which one um

782
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,799
so you know it may be a salient concept

783
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,799
for me as a thinking agent but it's not

784
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,000
one that's sailing for me when i'm

785
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,159
navigating a field of flowers basically

786
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,600
nice thanks for bringing in um umvelt

787
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,399
and

788
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,679
a lot of ecological psychology terms

789
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,279
do make their way to active and so then

790
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,440
you brought up like levels of perception

791
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,039
and salience for example there's things

792
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,640
that are outside of the wavelength that

793
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,679
can be perceived so photons are not

794
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,679
going to be perceived at that wavelength

795
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,679
but then there might be within the

796
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,559
visible range

797
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,000
novel

798
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
arrangements

799
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
like there's something moving there

800
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,200
or there might be something that is

801
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,240
static yet commands attention like the

802
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
mona lisa

803
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
so what is happening when somebody's

804
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,559
regime of attention is fixated on a

805
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,360
static artifact

806
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
versus

807
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
something where they're being fixated on

808
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,200
something that's rapidly changing like a

809
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,519
movie

810
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,440
mallory in the chat you wrote can folks

811
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,360
recommend papers so definitely people

812
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,120
can recommend papers

813
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,200
anywhere they see fit

814
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,600
and one place to check out is in the

815
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,039
bottom of our coda in the live streams

816
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,279
under the live stream tab

817
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,840
you'll find like

818
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,480
45 um papers that we've relatively

819
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,039
extensively discussed

820
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,519
and so these are are not like the only

821
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,279
or the canonical papers or anything but

822
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,519
there's a lot of important ones in there

823
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,399
so

824
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,760
especially if you're interested in

825
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
looking at papers where like people in

826
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,679
the lab might have familiarity or

827
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,679
there's some things to listen to or

828
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,200
watch about it

829
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
then these are some good places to start

830
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,480
all right

831
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,600
awesome

832
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,639
next question

833
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,000
all right this is a contextualization

834
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,039
question

835
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,600
this is not a metadata contextualizing

836
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
sentence

837
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,880
on page 9 and 10 they talk about

838
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
differences from alternative frameworks

839
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
for example in contrast with other

840
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,919
frameworks

841
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,080
policy selection in active inference

842
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
automatically balances exploration and

843
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,919
exploitation

844
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,000
and later active inference extends the

845
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,919
inferential approach to domains of

846
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,039
cognition that are rarely considered

847
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,880
what are

848
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,039
five to seven examples

849
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,880
names in a sentence of other theories

850
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
and frameworks that active inference

851
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
improves upon or updates

852
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,080
anyone can raise their hand this is an

853
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,559
excellent um

flash collaborative stigma g question

856
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,720

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,240
of one novel

brought

862
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,559
very quickly

863
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,120
as a textbook group we could have like

864
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,199
quite a coherent and comprehensive list

865
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,440
the idea of balancing exploration and

866
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,200
exploitation

867
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
so called is going to be

868
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,000
a key

869
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,679
theme

870
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,919
and the way that active inference

871
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,200
does

872
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,399
handle

873
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,399
this trade-off

874
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,320
not through the use of like an

875
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
exploratory mode or exploitative mode or

876
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,679
some parameter that is like governing

877
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,760
the the handoff there like some sort of

878
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,799
you know

879
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,760
x times exploration

880
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,120
plus one minus x of exploitation

881
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
that is like one approach that's

882
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,320
commonly used but

883
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,519
it would be

884
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,600
um a question of like where you know

885
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,040
which citations use that type of an

886
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,159
approach

887
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,520
and it's

888
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,918
going to come

889
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,879
to the epistemic and pragmatic value

890
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,918
whereas

891
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,560
um when there's little epistemic value

892
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,879
to be gleaned little informational

893
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,199
uncertainty result to resolve

894
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,320
then pragmatic value can be pursued

895
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,359
which is

896
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,239
reducing the surprise about

897
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,280
outcomes in relationship to preferences

898
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,040
and then on the other hand when there's

899
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,599
a lot of uncertainty

900
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,800
exploratory behavior might be engaged in

901
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,599
because there isn't enough

902
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
certainty around how to pursue those

903
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
pragmatic aims

904
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,119
and these are going to come into play

905
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
with like the team

906
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,199
mouse model that's going to be later in

907
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,280
the book

908
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,680
but this is a great question so anyone

909
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
want to like just give an example of

910
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,160
some other theory or framework

911
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
or some other approach to thinking about

912
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,400
exploration exploitation

913
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
one starting reading if anyone is

914
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,480
interested there is a 2015 paper

915
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,240
that is looking at exploration and

916
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
exploitation trade-offs

917
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,240
in different domains ali

918
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,440
well i don't know if it necessarily

919
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,160
improves upon but

920
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,560
certainly an alternative approach to

921
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,079
this theory

922
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,480
can be

923
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,839
stephen grossberg's art theory the

924
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,079
adaptive resonance theory that we talked

925
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,800
about a previous session

926
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,560
in that theory

927
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,520
uh the problem of learning and cognition

928
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,680
uh is attacked from the viewpoint of

929
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,960
solving

930
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,560
the stability slash plasticity dilemma

931
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,680
and uh in this context in the context of

932
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,280
art or adaptive resonance theory uh well

933
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,079
uh

934
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,880
or

935
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
let's say the difference between the

936
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,640
active imprint one of the main

937
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,560
differences between the active imprints

938
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,920
or any

939
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,520
predictive coding schemes

940
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,720
from

941
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,440
adaptive resonance theory is that

942
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,760
in bayesian models

943
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,119
generally

944
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,440
the fully

945
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,720
fully

946
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,119
suppressive matching

947
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,000
circuits uh i mean uh the uh

948
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,320
[Music]

949
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,040
the circuits that can propagate the

950
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,599
information it cannot solve the

951
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,000
stability slash plasticity dilemma as

952
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,960
opposed to the art or adaptive resonance

953
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,359
theory

954
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,040
so plasticity being more exploratory and

955
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,119
openness to updates

956
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,920
and stability being more like parametric

957
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,520
lock-in

958
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,119
more exploitative within a certain um

959
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,640
well yeah the plasticity refers to a

960
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,880
system that doesn't have

961
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,560
uh catastrophic

962
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,759
catastrophic forgetfulness

963
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,599
awesome

964
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,960
cool so we can just you know have this

965
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,640
question up and check back and people

966
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,960
can add things we'll just look at a few

967
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
more questions

968
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
so

969
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
on page 8 they write

970
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
the high road perspective is useful to

971
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
understand the normative nature of

972
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,200
active inference

973
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
what the living organisms must do to

974
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,119
face their fundamental existential

975
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,320
challenges

976
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
minimize free energy

977
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,960
and why the what and the why in the high

978
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,160
road

979
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,119
why to vicariously minimize the surprise

980
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,280
of their sensory observations

981
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,480
what does it mean to minimize surprise

982
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,320
vicariously

983
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,000
so someone has written

984
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
interesting choice of words here are two

985
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,359
possible answers also the authors or

986
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,800
the readers participants may have

987
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
something else in mind

988
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,720
vicarious might refer to the point on

989
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,800
page six that agents cannot tractably

990
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,880
minimize surprise as the authors

991
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
technically defined it

992
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,480
in chapter two coming up

993
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,079
so instead they're going to minimize an

994
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,960
approximation to surprise which is

995
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
variational free energy

996
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,280
however i'm not sure if they're

997
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,119
referring to

998
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,079
the two

999
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,560
types of surprise that are going to be

1000
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,920
approached in chapter two which is the

1001
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,599
marginal surprise

1002
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,599
um like informational surprise and then

1003
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,440
the bayesian surprise

1004
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,400
or both

1005
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,320
so one option is

1006
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
surprise as defined

1007
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,400
one way or the other or both

1008
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,359
cannot be directly

1009
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,079
calculated or it's not tractable to to

1010
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
pursue and so the vicarious could mean

1011
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,000
like indirect or via a proxy

1012
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,920
and in that case something like

1013
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,440
variational free energy is being

1014
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,920
vicariously minimized and then that is

1015
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
going to be used to

1016
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
get at the surprise minimization and the

1017
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,560
second option the person has written

1018
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,320
vicarious might refer to the point that

1019
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
agents minimize free energy not only in

1020
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
response to real sensory observations

1021
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,800
but in anticipation of them

1022
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
those anticipations could come from

1023
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
internal simulations by subroutines or

1024
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
other modules or memory from recall of

1025
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,560
past observed events

1026
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,359
page 32 which is probably in chapter two

1027
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,280
the authors seem to be referring to

1028
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,359
engaging models vicariously in a counter

1029
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,119
factual sense dealing with imagined

1030
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
surprise at presumed observations

1031
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,160
so these are really important comments

1032
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,920
we have the indirect minimization of

1033
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
surprise

1034
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,440
using a proxy

1035
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,240
so some type of heuristic to minimizing

1036
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,079
surprise now

1037
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,880
and so that is vicarious but

1038
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,400
contemporary

1039
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,480
and then the second sense

1040
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,760
is

1041
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,040
whether we're using a proxy or not

1042
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,880
is referring to

1043
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,170
um

1044
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,839
[Music]

1045
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,760
observations that haven't occurred so

1046
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,760
anticipated or expected observations

1047
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,359
some of these hopefully we'll come back

1048
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,680
to in chapter two

1049
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,839
but these are important questions and

1050
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,680
it's gonna speak to

1051
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
like variational free energy

1052
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,319
and expected free energy and free energy

1053
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,240
of the expected future a few other

1054
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
constructs

1055
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,040
stephen and yeah and then

1056
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
yeah i put that last comment and i was

1057
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,119
just thinking that should probably go

1058
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,359
under number two there so i guess that

1059
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,640
would be

1060
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,560
evidence of that second interpretation

1061
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,960
thank you

1062
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,280
okay

1063
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,839
so we'll maybe return to this in um

1064
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,079
chapter two

1065
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,160
okay let's just see if we can look up

1066
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
just a few of these questions it's

1067
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,359
awesome like how many there are and of

1068
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,119
course anyone can always

1069
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,160
read and contribute asynchronously

1070
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,599
all right

1071
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,920
the subtitle of the book is the free

1072
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,800
energy principle in mind brain and

1073
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,720
behavior what is the relevant

1074
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,920
distinction

1075
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,079
between mind and brain in the context of

1076
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,119
the free energy principle

1077
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,440
someone has written really appreciate

1078
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,720
how the researchers have started

1079
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,800
proposing biological implementations of

1080
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,640
active in the brain

1081
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800
but it's not clear to me how this maps

1082
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,280
onto related psychological concepts like

1083
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
colloquial surprise predictions salience

1084
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,800
arousal

1085
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,319
yeah awesome and there's been some

1086
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,400
recent work and some work that we're

1087
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,520
going to be looking at in um

1088
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,839
live stream 46

1089
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,720
on active inference and folk psychology

1090
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
about connecting some of the formalisms

1091
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,359
to to folk psychological concepts so

1092
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,400
that's one

1093
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,160
place we'll be

1094
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,119
looking at that but

1095
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,370
um

1096
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,520
[Music]

1097
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,280
how does

1098
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,280
or does active approach this mind brain

1099
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
question

1100
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,480
whether the cartesian

1101
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,319
duelist question

1102
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,839
hard problem of consciousness

1103
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,520
intentional stance of dennit

1104
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,720
why is the subtitle of the book that way

1105
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,720
jessica and then anyone else with their

1106
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,760
hand

1107
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,160
um yes i mean i don't know to the answer

1108
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,200
but

1109
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,160
i

1110
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
i guess make a guess i think maybe they

1111
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,960
um mind will be more the cognition and

1112
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,839
the brain looking at the physiology

1113
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,040
and

1114
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,599
and then you know looking at behaviors

1115
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,480
that would be my guess

1116
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,319
yeah awesome

1117
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,040
bacterium does not have a brain

1118
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,599
but does it have a mind

1119
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,560
also

1120
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,880
great questions we'll just continue just

1121
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,920
these

1122
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,599
questions with fewer upvotes because

1123
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,200
there's such a bunch just so we can get

1124
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,319
them in

1125
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,200
so

1126
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,319
generative model is used in the singular

1127
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,440
or

1128
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,960
is used in the singular as in the

1129
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,319
generative model

1130
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,880
or in the plural as in hierarchical

1131
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,200
generative models

1132
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
is a generative model composed of

1133
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
generative models i.e is it structurally

1134
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
fractal

1135
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,119
someone has written personally i think

1136
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,800
the answer is yes

1137
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,440
or it's possible to answer yes

1138
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,000
via referencing a paper that talks about

1139
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,240
blankets of blankets markov blankets

1140
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,319
life this paper definitely

1141
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,680
does um think about the nesting of

1142
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,280
multi-scale complex systems

1143
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,040
in terms of like nested generative

1144
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,079
models

1145
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,440
that then

1146
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,640
are

1147
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,440
constituting

1148
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,200
yes

1149
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,160
that are then constituting um generative

1150
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,480
models at a higher level

1151
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,839
so like there's people with their

1152
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,520
generative model and then the team has a

1153
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,599
generative model of a different type jf

1154
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,880
yes but even in individual

1155
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,480
myself yourself

1156
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,359
um

1157
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,160
it can be could be characterized as

1158
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,480
having a generative model

1159
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,200
composed of uh

1160
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,160
other general models dealing with uh

1161
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,200
less abstract uh umvelt for example

1162
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,920
so i i think i think yes i think almost

1163
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,040
trivially in the sense of a collective

1164
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
but in the sense of an individual uh

1165
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,640
does an individual also

1166
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,720
can be said to possess a generative

1167
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,160
model that is itself composed of

1168
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,960
sub-generative models

1169
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,200
awesome point and we've

1170
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,480
in several

1171
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,319
live streams and settings discussed like

1172
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,720
there's one sense where nesting is used

1173
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,680
to refer to systems that are like

1174
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,960
potentially even physically nested

1175
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,200
and then we also see the nesting

1176
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,480
architecture

1177
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,240
for example here it's live stream number

1178
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
25

1179
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,359
when we discussed it but this is a

1180
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,640
nesting

1181
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,520
of

1182
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,720
attentional and cognitive models

1183
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,119
so this is even of a so-called

1184
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,599
individual so what is it

1185
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,760
about model nesting when sometimes it

1186
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,920
can refer to

1187
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,079
physical enclosure

1188
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,720
and other times it is something that

1189
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,440
enables counter factual reasoning

1190
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,800
attention and metacognition

1191
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
so what is the nesting and and if

1192
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,720
someone is just seeing this kind of a

1193
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,640
notation or this kind of a graph for the

1194
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,720
first time we're gonna totally

1195
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,839
go into it but it's gonna be one of the

1196
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,319
core formalisms and also this paper is

1197
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,680
going to deal with nested models and

1198
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,760
other papers do the textbook is going to

1199
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,000
spend almost all the time

1200
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,440
um on just one level so just sort of the

1201
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,920
kernel or the essence or the archetype

1202
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
or the essential motif

1203
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
of this partially observable markov

1204
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,359
decision process

1205
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,040
and the textbook is going to focus on

1206
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,680
juxtaposing the discrete time

1207
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,599
partially observable markov decision

1208
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,640
process with a continuous time

1209
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,079
but it will deal less with hierarchical

1210
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,400
nesting but it does bring it up but it's

1211
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,160
not going to be focused on

1212
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,319
okay

1213
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,079
what is the information content of a

1214
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,200
prediction

1215
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,720
i'm just going to read these ones just

1216
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,359
so that those who are listening can see

1217
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,559
like the kinds of questions that they

1218
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,599
could be adding or addressing

1219
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,200
this question has to do with the

1220
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,960
relationship between active inference

1221
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,119
and pleasant surprises

1222
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,280
potentially even love languages

1223
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,640
receiving money on the pavement

1224
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,040
page five

1225
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,720
is uh speaking to the author's rhetoric

1226
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,480
around theory proliferation and

1227
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,040
integration where basically they are

1228
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,720
saying well we could have a dedicated

1229
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,359
explanation for every neurotransmitter

1230
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,599
for every synaptic junction every unique

1231
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,079
behavior every cognitive phenomena

1232
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,839
or we could somehow utilize first

1233
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,480
principles whatever those are to result

1234
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,400
in theory integration

1235
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,319
and that gets mapped onto the scruffies

1236
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,880
and the neats

1237
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,280
is it really helpful to redefine terms

1238
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
such as probability and surprise to

1239
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,839
sometimes mean utility

1240
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,160
and diversions from utility if that's

1241
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,240
what the authors are doing there appears

1242
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,079
to be an unhealthy ambiguity in how they

1243
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,559
use these terms

1244
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,240
this is where the formalisms are gonna

1245
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,079
really come into play

1246
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,360
um and also the um

1247
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,400
[Music]

1248
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,720
the live stream on

1249
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,040
free energy a user's guide

1250
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,559
37

1251
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,440
deals with this um dual interpretation

1252
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,839
of expectations and preferences and this

1253
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,280
is like one of the most essential

1254
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,280
differences between active inference and

1255
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,880
reward learning or reinforcement

1256
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,800
learning frameworks

1257
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,839
is a dual

1258
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,240
deployment of the same variable

1259
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,079
in formalisms

1260
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,040
to represent preferred states as well as

1261
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
expected states

1262
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,680
like homeostatic range is expected and

1263
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,839
preferred it's where one wants to be

1264
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,000
found and it's where one expects to be

1265
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,400
found and so one can realize those

1266
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,040
preferences by reducing their surprise

1267
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,280
about the observations rather than

1268
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,800
saying well homeostatic states are

1269
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
valuable and we're going to pursue

1270
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,839
maximum value

1271
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,559
i might it be

1272
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,920
how might an acceptable state space

1273
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,480
relate to the idea of a comfort zone

1274
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,720
it seems the acceptable state space for

1275
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,839
an organism is necessary for it to

1276
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,160
persist whereas a comfort zone seems to

1277
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,240
be a less necessary state repertoire

1278
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,160
which if exceeded may only indicate to

1279
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,079
an organism that it's at risk of leaving

1280
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,720
the acceptable state space

1281
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,079
interesting

1282
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,960
and then the last written question here

1283
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,040
looking ahead into part two have people

1284
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,559
been looking in the computational

1285
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,880
complexity of the active inference model

1286
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,559
and how far are we in terms of making

1287
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,440
this computable

1288
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,680
and the reference 2019 paper

1289
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,200
computational resource demands of the

1290
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,558
predictive bayesian brain

1291
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,760
excellent and important

1292
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,280
question to understand like the

1293
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,000
analytical computational complexity like

1294
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,960
the big o notation does nesting a model

1295
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,520
make it two or is it you know log the

1296
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,440
number of levels or is it number of

1297
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,079
levels to the sum exponent

1298
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,880
um and then also in practice like using

1299
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,400
active block for ins or pi mdp

1300
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,800
what is the actual runtime of different

1301
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,559
algorithms

1302
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,520
so

1303
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,400
um

1304
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,800
this is awesome with the questions that

1305
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,640
everyone's added to one like we're going

1306
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,119
to keep on returning to chapter one just

1307
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,400
like we're going to keep on returning to

1308
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,960
the ideas but people can fold it

1309
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,200
and continue to add to two

1310
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,800
and to the appendices which we're gonna

1311
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
go to next week um so just as a reminder

1312
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
next week we're going to be

1313
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,480
approaching appendix a and b

1314
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,319
which are mathematical

1315
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,160
and so just a few thoughts on that

1316
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,520
before we return back to the ideas in

1317
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,800
the book

1318
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,880
in appendix a

1319
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,960
you can see that all the equations have

1320
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,880
already been added

1321
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
so if anyone like wants to reference

1322
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,800
like what does equation a point 44 mean

1323
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,119
um and obviously like there's 60

1324
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,040
equations and you could get your

1325
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,160
phd learning about some sub function of

1326
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,800
just one so we're just trying to

1327
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,319
familiarize and get a first coat of

1328
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,000
paint so for those with different

1329
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,839
mathematical backgrounds

1330
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,480
if somebody can derive the proof

1331
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,520
amazing

1332
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,000
let's take some notes on it and if

1333
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,160
somebody is just going to be asking

1334
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,839
beginner questions that's also very

1335
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,680
important so

1336
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,599
that will be in next week's questions

1337
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,800
and discussions

1338
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,960
but let's just look at what ideas people

1339
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,520
wrote and then see if there's any ideas

1340
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,720
percolating

1341
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,319
so

1342
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,599
um

1343
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,880
having addressed

1344
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,760
some specific uncertainties i get with

1345
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,400
the questions we can think about like

1346
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,839
what are some impressions that people

1347
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,119
were having

1348
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,720
and like what was exciting ideas

1349
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,240
so if um ben or mike want to

1350
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,000
speak to this or if anybody else like

1351
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,520
wants to share something jf and then

1352
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,000
anyone else

1353
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,680
yeah

1354
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,800
jf then ben or is your hand raised

1355
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,599
no my hand was not raised i'm sorry ben

1356
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,119
go for it

1357
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,400
yeah thanks can you hear me yep

1358
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,000
cool uh yeah maybe i should have posed

1359
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,319
this as a question actually i just

1360
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,240
thought it was it was interesting this

1361
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,000
connection between perception and

1362
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,079
learning as essentially the same process

1363
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,920
unfolding over different

1364
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,359
time scales

1365
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,960
because on the one hand this makes sense

1366
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,200
to me because one example of learning

1367
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,440
might be you can imagine an agent move

1368
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,200
into a new city

1369
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,280
with which they're completely unfamiliar

1370
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
and the agent could

1371
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,680
sit at a fixed point in the city or walk

1372
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,359
around the city and just perceive the

1373
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,160
city and they would learn over a longer

1374
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,520
time scale they would observe certain

1375
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,319
regularities or certain occurrences

1376
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,640
and clearly that's one form of learning

1377
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,040
but then there's maybe another example

1378
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,000
where

1379
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,480
you know my mathematical background's

1380
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,200
fairly weak and so if i were to try and

1381
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
learn the kind of fundamentals of the

1382
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,440
equations that we were just looking at

1383
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,720
um no matter how for how long i

1384
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,280
kind of perceive those equations

1385
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,480
i'm not going to learn them there's

1386
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,920
going to be that i have no access to

1387
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,319
kind there's no information gained there

1388
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,240
it seems like to learn certain things we

1389
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,720
need to scaffold perception

1390
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,319
in certain ways and so i suppose my

1391
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,480
question would be

1392
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
when somebody teaches us something that

1393
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,960
we don't understand is that merely a

1394
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,599
kind of scaffolded perception

1395
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,680
or is that kind of learning underwritten

1396
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,240
by distinct cognitive processing

1397
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,000
um completely separate from perception

1398
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,440
great question thanks for unpacking that

1399
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,040
and to give one

1400
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,319
uh thought

1401
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,319
let's imagine a ball moving across the

1402
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,079
visual field

1403
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,920
it seems like a canonical example of

1404
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,480
perception we're perceiving the ball but

1405
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,799
it could also be understood as parameter

1406
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,200
updating or parameter learning

1407
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,480
of

1408
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,400
the location of the ball

1409
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,359
and then

1410
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,079
that's one approach but then also you

1411
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,839
pointed towards like this deeper sense

1412
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,400
of learning referring to like the

1413
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,480
underlying structures like in the ball

1414
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,160
movement examples it seems like learning

1415
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,680
and perception

1416
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,760
are the same but then learning might

1417
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,000
also refer to something deeper like the

1418
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,880
tendencies of how balls move or one

1419
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,680
could

1420
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,160
as probably many of us have look at

1421
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,440
these

1422
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,480
symbols

1423
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,880
and perceive them visually

1424
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,760
but because we wouldn't have learned the

1425
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,839
underlying generative model

1426
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,640
that gives rise to these pixels we could

1427
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,359
continually be surprised

1428
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,839
so what is happening when there's

1429
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,440
perception and learning

1430
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,079
seemingly happening hand in hand

1431
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,440
and then other times where somebody's

1432
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,960
speaking a language you don't understand

1433
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,119
you certainly hear it you may even be

1434
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,640
paying attention to it

1435
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,720
yet the next phoneme may still

1436
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,480
continually surprise you

1437
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,760
so it's a really important question

1438
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,839
and

1439
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,880
then um mike wrote um

1440
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,640
yes please go for it mike

1441
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,480
yeah uh so

1442
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,599
i think

1443
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:56,960
these are straightforward but

1444
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,599
foundational concepts that the

1445
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,440
dependence of sensory input on action

1446
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,799
and vice versa

1447
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,799
creates a framework where we can have

1448
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,880
feedback and then

1449
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,720
the mathematical constructs let us think

1450
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,640
about how we model that and simulate it

1451
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,079
thanks for this

1452
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,640
also essential point in active inference

1453
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,720
there isn't a perception and inference

1454
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,880
module that passes the perceptions to

1455
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,240
the learning module and the learning

1456
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,079
module passes it to the decision making

1457
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,680
module the decision making modules of

1458
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,240
the action model the inference is

1459
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,640
conditioned upon policy selection and

1460
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,839
action

1461
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,799
and that is going to approach this nexus

1462
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,359
of perception cognition and action

1463
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,400
in an integrated way that not

1464
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,319
that may differ from other frameworks

1465
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
which was also to the point of that

1466
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,359
um

1467
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,880
previous question

1468
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,160
so

1469
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,880
this was um an awesome

1470
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,680
session everyone really

1471
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,040
appreciated it

1472
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,359
i'll upload the video recording

1473
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,559
bala following the meeting

1474
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,400
next week at the same time we'll be

1475
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,319
looking at questions and ideas from

1476
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,000
appendix a and b

1477
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,520
so just approach those however you'd

1478
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,760
like and annotate the coda

1479
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,839
and

1480
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,079
uh also if anybody wants to like specify

1481
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,160
another time when they just want to

1482
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,720
discuss or co-work

1483
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,480
that can be added

1484
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,359
or

1485
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,119
in the actin flap discord people can

1486
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,960
like join it we can have like a voice

1487
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,280
like a study hour or just a time to talk

1488
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,200
about stuff or write down the questions

1489
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,280
we have so

1490
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,920
awesome work everybody thanks a lot
