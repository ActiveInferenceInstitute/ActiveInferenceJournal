1210	144274	00:01	 Chapter nine is model based Data analysis. There's a short introduction, a discussion of metabasian methods. Ultimately, the models described in this book are only useful if they can answer scientific questions.	Chapter nine is model based Data analysis	Machine Learning textbook discussion
144392	357136	02:24	This chapter deals with the utility of active inference in analyzing data from behavioral experiments. Phenotype is something of a biological organism or system that's measurable. There's two reasons for fitting a computational model to observe behavior. The first is to estimate parameters of interest. The second is to compare alternative hypotheses.

357168	546370	05:57	In Section 9.2, it says this goes beyond the proof of principle simulations and instead exploits active inference in answering scientific questions. What does this mean and how does it differ from the approach from answering real scientific questions?

The outer dashed box is somehow our generative models as the observers. If this is us modeling, it seems like it would be like infinitely recursive.

Whether we formalize it or not, the experimenter's behavior is influencing the parameterization of the patients. This is where we can talk about moving beyond implicit biases.

From those Laplacian approximations, we're going to do variational inference. Because of the quadratic nature, we can do gradient ascent.

1680354	2615090	28:00	All right, parametric empirical Bayes is heavily used in SPM. This is widely used to take an empirical data set and then use the data set's empirical values to parameterize the generative model. Does merely constructing a POMDP in this format uniquely identify a likelihood function?	Parametric empirical Bayes is heavily used in SPM	Parametric empirical Bayes in SPM

Another advantage is that you have access to all the statistical tools of frequent statistics. In the Bayes world, there are richer comparisons and more nuanced penalization functions.

This lets us use active inference as a non invasive tool to probe the computational processes that individuals use to make decisions.
