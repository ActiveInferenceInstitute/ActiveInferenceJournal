1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
of these questions

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
i think we talked about the oh this is

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,520
chapter two

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,400
uh let's go to chapter four

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
okay

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,840
so we talked about belief policy state

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
i'm not sure if we talked about this

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,230
question

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,760
[Music]

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
in the discussion of active inference in

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
pomdp

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
belief updating about policies we find

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,840
that the posterior that minimizes the

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,479
free energy does it posterior at time t

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,880
oh we did discuss this

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
yeah we did discuss this last time

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,160
so

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
uh

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,320
this question

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,280
i think um

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,160
we did not discuss pi being a policy or

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,200
a model

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
last time or did we

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,680
i think we didn't get to this

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
yeah i don't think we discussed that all

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,719
right so we can open it up and um

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
we'll start here i guess with the the

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
most upvoted so the question reads

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,720
what is pi on page 69 the authors write

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,640
at each time step the current state is

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
conditionally dependent on the state at

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
the previous time and on the policy pie

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
currently being perceived pursued then

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
on page 71 they write thus we can

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,360
interpret the priors of equation 4.6

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,960
combined with the likelihood of equation

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
4.5 as expressing a model pi of a

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
behavioral sequence so which is it

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
policy or model

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,159
and then they suggest a rewrite of the

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,079
sentence they say that thus we can

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,640
interpret the priors of equation 4.6

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
combined with the likelihood of equation

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,240
4.5 and the transition probabilities b

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
sub tau pi

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,399
as expressing a model for a behavioral

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,840
sequence where the model is a function

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
of policy pi

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,479
and then there's some discourse here so

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,240
in this reframing can we say that the

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
model simulates the agent in the

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
environment as as if it had taken the

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
actions in the policy

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,439
um

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,520
and i don't know does anyone have any i

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,598
don't know who asked that question um

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
oh eric that was you that was your

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,160
question uh and then does anyone want to

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
maybe take a stab at answering that

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
question or we can continue reading what

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,040
was written here

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
uh so

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
what's written here

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
says that on page 69 the authors

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
also say policies here may be thought of

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
as indexing alternative trajectories or

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
sequences of actions that could be

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
followed on page 71 they defined the

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
likelihood in equation 4.5 as a matrix a

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,239
that expresses the probability of an

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
outcome they describe the priors of

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
equation 4.6 as the prior over the

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,160
initial state vector d

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
and beliefs about how the state at one

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
time transitions to the state at the

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,440
next time

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
matrix b and they also say that the

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
transitions are conditionally dependent

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
on the policy chosen because of this

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
conditional dependence we can see how

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
the policy influences the model and why

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
the authors use may use these the terms

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,840
interchangeably

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
so

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
does anyone have any

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,839
comments there

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
um i guess i would say that that um

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
answer in discourse

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
kind of um agrees with my that i

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
proposed which is

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,120
that strictly speaking

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
um we should treat the

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,959
pie as policy

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,159
but

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,560
it behaves as a model but once it's

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
executed it's implemented then

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
um

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
the model become the model has become a

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
function of the policy that's been we've

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
seen so far

101
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,040
so i i'd say that's a you know

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
that's compatible

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,840
um interpretation so i think strictly

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
speaking

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,000
um

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
the um

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
it would be better if the text was

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
consistent and called pi

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,879
a policy

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,440
and then um say yeah the model is a

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,798
function of path

112
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,400
that'd be my interpretation

113
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
yeah i definitely agree with that i

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,199
think that the model

115
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,479
is policy specific so so

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,280
yeah but they could do a better job of i

117
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
mean the variables

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
as we've seen are so

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
ambiguous anyway so it could definitely

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,600
be a lot better

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
uh and by the way uh about the topic of

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
consistency um actually i gave some

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,520
thoughts about the issue we were

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
discussing in yesterday's math learning

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,199
session

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,280
and i also consulted some other papers

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,560
and active inference and

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
in all of them the notation for matrices

129
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
and vectors

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
is used consistently as in almost every

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,160
linear algebra textbook so i'm seriously

132
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
beginning to suspect that every instance

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
of a matrix or a vector not written in

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,639
boldface is a typo either in chapters or

135
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,960
appendices because otherwise i really

136
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
cannot find any justification behind

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
using two different types of notation so

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
i'm going to use this assumption as my

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
prior for the rest of the book unless

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
someone has any belief updating

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
observation she wants to share

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
so just to summarize for for the people

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
that weren't there yesterday we had a

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
big debate about what does the bold

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,720
um typeface signify

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
and it wasn't so much a debate but but

147
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
just like a mutual trying to come to a

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
mutual understanding so it's this

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
question here does bold lettering mean

150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
this is a matrix but seemingly also many

151
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
non-bold letters are matrix or does bold

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
lettering mean sufficient statistics of

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
um as as on these page examples

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
and it really was uh

155
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
yeah we couldn't come to a

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
single unified answer there

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
because there are many instances where

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
it seems like it should be a matrix but

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
it's not bold

160
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,600
and there are many instances where

161
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,479
um sufficient statistics like are used

162
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
but it's also not bold so

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,360
so yeah we couldn't really conclude that

164
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
um but i think ali that that's a good

165
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,800
assumption there

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
uh so we also talked about this

167
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
a little bit last time but we didn't

168
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
really get fully into this question what

169
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
is the use of categorical distributions

170
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,599
in equation 4.5 the second line is

171
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
supposed to explain the cat notation but

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
i have problems to understand the

173
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
advantage of the notation could someone

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
explain it in simple words

175
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
does anyone want to try to explain that

176
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,840
i can pull up the equation

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
uh well i think every regular matrix and

178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
vector

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
is

180
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
by definition an array of ordered

181
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
elements

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,880
uh but in a categorical distribution uh

183
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
we don't necessarily assign any

184
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
any specific order to the elements so

185
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
uh the reason behind using the

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
categorical categorical distribution

187
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
might be

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,879
uh

189
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
to just jettison any

190
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
uh orderness in the elements and treat

191
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,319
them as just

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
uh an on an unordered set of the

193
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
probabilities

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
i wrote an answer to this one if you

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,319
want to pull that out

196
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,759
so you can just write that

197
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,320
so i hope this is helpful

198
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,519
it's basically

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
the way i see it is you have the math

200
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
the math notation there

201
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
but when you need to actually implement

202
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,480
that you need to carry it out then you

203
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
need to turn that into operations you

204
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
can perform

205
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
and so the um when you call when you say

206
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
that

207
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
a is this categorical

208
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
object that means that you you're

209
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
turning it into an actual

210
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
matrix

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
with elements and so the ordering is

212
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,360
important actually because

213
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,880
then the ordering of the elements in the

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
matrix says how that matrix is going to

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
apply to

216
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,959
um the objects it applies to which are

217
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,920
the um the belief state s and then the

218
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
your observation

219
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
o

220
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
so um

221
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
basically it says

222
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
the way you carry out

223
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
inferring what o will be

224
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
the probability of o given a belief

225
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,680
state is you do a matrix multiply

226
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
and

227
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,839
the because our in in this you know in

228
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,120
this example

229
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
um

230
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,920
the the um states are not continuous

231
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,440
they're categorical

232
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,240
then you need a categorical matrix you

233
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
know elements in order to do

234
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,200
map from the categories of

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
belief states to the categories of

236
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
observation states and those are all

237
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
those are both distributions

238
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
that gets transformed by the

239
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,319
matrix

240
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
thanks eric that was super

241
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
helpful

242
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,040
does anybody have any further question

243
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
or comment on this one

244
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
uh sorry eric but

245
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
isn't the categorical notation special

246
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,839
case of multinomial distribution

247
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,920
categorical distribution special cases

248
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,440
of multinomial distribution

249
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
and

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
i don't know that

251
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
yeah because that was my understanding

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,640
that the main difference between uh any

253
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
categorical distribution and uh

254
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
well

255
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,399
i mean uh the the lack of

256
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,480
for instance if we

257
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
of course you're right that in any

258
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
matrix

259
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,760
we necessarily have some ordered

260
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,320
elements in order uh for us to be able

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,519
to compute

262
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,399
the math on those matrices uh but on the

263
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
other hand uh

264
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,200
for categorical distributions

265
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
at least that was my understanding that

266
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
uh we don't necessarily

267
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,880
treat them as

268
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
ordered elements such as

269
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
i don't know the ordered

270
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
vectors or ordered matrices as

271
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,120
the normal

272
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
matrix because uh if that was the case

273
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
well

274
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,720
we could just uh designate this this

275
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
distribution as just a regular matrix

276
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,839
right so uh i don't get what's the

277
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
reason behind using

278
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,279
uh the notation here a

279
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,279
cat

280
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,279
stephen can you mute you're super loud

281
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,439
over there

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,279
sorry

283
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
uh

284
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,600
yeah i i guess so

285
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
um

286
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,279
i mean yeah so the mathematical notation

287
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,120
doesn't have an ordering it just says

288
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,639
distribution is related to another

289
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
distribution through this

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,399
um

291
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
this this relation and it's when you get

292
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
to the mechanics of how do you

293
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,120
how do you do that that's where you care

294
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,440
that you have the matrix with with

295
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,920
the vector ordering so yeah i don't know

296
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
what

297
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
cat

298
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,079
a actually means otherwise other than

299
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,040
it's just describing it it's saying

300
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
i don't think it's like an operator i

301
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,040
think it's just saying what it is

302
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,439
that makes sense

303
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
steven if you're trying to talk we can't

304
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,680
hear

305
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
i feel like steven is trying to share an

306
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
idea with us

307
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,000
but is unable to communicate effectively

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
through the technological affordances

309
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
he's been given at the time

310
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,639
like the gain on your mic is way up or

311
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,399
something uh so it's picking up more

312
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,199
background noise than you

313
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,680
so just looking at this equation

314
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,199
um

315
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,199
let's try that again

316
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
so just looking at this equation can you

317
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,360
guys hear me okay

318
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,279
yeah

319
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
yeah okay

320
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
so just looking at this equation

321
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
the second part

322
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
it's like the

323
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,720
it's like an ordered matrix a i j

324
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
um

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
where the probability of the

326
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
observations are

327
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,279
equal to index i and the states equal to

328
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,720
index j

329
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
something like that

330
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,680
um

331
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
i don't know some it looks like it is

332
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,279
ordered

333
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,240
um

334
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
yeah the matrix itself is ordered

335
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
yeah and so the second line is is

336
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,880
actually by how the authors are defining

337
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
this cat a

338
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
so so cat a represents this ordered

339
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,440
matrix a i j

340
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
um

341
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,199
yeah

342
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,720
that's at least what it what it says in

343
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,800
the textbook

344
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
so it says the likelihood expressing the

345
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
probability of observations conditioned

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,959
on time tau given states s

347
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
conditioned on time tau is equal to the

348
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,959
categorical distribution a

349
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,639
um

350
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
okay

351
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,959
uh

352
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,439
if i may

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,399
sorry sorry yaku

354
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
go ahead sorry my internet is a bit is

355
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
lagging a bit so there might be a delay

356
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
and i might break off but i just want to

357
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
comment that i think that the

358
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,519
cat notation is really just to

359
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,199
uh like

360
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
reinforce

361
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
the the notion that it's in discrete

362
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
time but i think it's

363
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,919
kind of

364
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
redundant in this case because

365
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,839
since we know that we are in discrete

366
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,599
time we could have just written

367
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,400
uh a bold to

368
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
uh signify that it's a matrix and when

369
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,599
it's a matrix it's probably not going to

370
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,400
be a continuous distribution anyway

371
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,919
um

372
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,119
so i think

373
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,079
cat

374
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,160
bolt a and bolt a is pretty much

375
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
interchangeable

376
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,480
so i think that some of the new math um

377
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
is using some of the affordances from

378
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,760
category theory more like some of the

379
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
the newer things and i think like the

380
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
forward

381
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
direction that

382
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,039
carl and thomas and some of the people

383
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
that really helped derive and

384
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
advance some of this math i think that

385
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
they're going to be leveraging category

386
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,679
theory methods like the renormalization

387
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
group and the pullback attractor um more

388
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,320
in the future and so that might be also

389
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
like

390
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,160
part of the reason that they are moving

391
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
toward this categorical notation so just

392
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,240
a little maybe foreshadowing there too

393
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,039
and may i just make some one additional

394
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
note about this categorical distribution

395
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
well the thing that confused me about uh

396
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
this this concept of categorical

397
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
distribution is uh the wikipedia's

398
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,240
definition of it because here it says

399
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
there is no innate underlying ordering

400
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
of these outcomes but numerical labels

401
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
are often attached for convenience in

402
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,320
describing

403
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,760
the distribution

404
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,760
so that was my confusion

405
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
um i don't think it would be the first

406
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,760
time that we've seen a traditional

407
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
mathematical notation slightly and

408
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,039
somewhat abused in active inference

409
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,039
probably also won't be the last

410
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
but definitely i think

411
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,799
it's a point that we can

412
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
put forward for to the authors for

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,919
additional clarification

414
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,039
um

415
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,120
if there's no further

416
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
anybody has anything else to say about

417
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,000
the categorical distributions here

418
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
if not we can move on to maybe the next

419
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,160
question

420
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
so this next question reads in message

421
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
passing is there a decay of information

422
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,919
as the distance between the variable x

423
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,840
and individual markov blanket

424
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
constituents increases

425
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
is implementation of information decay

426
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,240
in message passing an option for model

427
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
implementation

428
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
um i think that this is a super

429
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
interesting question and it's something

430
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
that i've thought about before a lot

431
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,480
uh

432
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
but but i think um

433
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
yeah let me open it up to anyone and see

434
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
if they want to address it before we can

435
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
get into some of the discourse

436
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,360
well doesn't that all

437
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
all depend upon the

438
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,039
the

439
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
chain of loss between one stage of the

440
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,480
message passing in another and if you

441
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,679
have no loss

442
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,000
then you don't have any decay

443
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
but you know the more stages you have

444
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,559
where you get a little bit of

445
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,320
diffusion or loss then you're going to

446
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
have decay

447
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,240
just a function of the parameters

448
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
well so our message is passed within

449
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,679
the same markov blanket or between

450
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,440
things that are partitioned with their

451
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
own markov blanket that's another

452
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,039
question

453
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
uh i also agree with eric

454
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,440
as i

455
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
mentioned

456
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,640
yesterday uh

457
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,120
i also believe that uh well

458
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,640
this message this information loss is

459
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,840
not accounted for at least inherently in

460
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
active inference formalism uh because

461
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
it depends on the specific situations

462
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
that

463
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
those information propagate because

464
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,760
otherwise uh

465
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,280
we couldn't have uh any uh

466
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,919
general or all-encompassing

467
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,880
formalism for accounting for these mess

468
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
information laws

469
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,799
so we see in this box

470
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,600
they talk about markov blankets and

471
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
the message passing so here it's

472
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,440
variational message passing this

473
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,919
involves messages from all constituents

474
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,559
of the markov blanket of x including the

475
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,400
parents via the conditional probability

476
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
of x given its parents and the children

477
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
the latter depends on the conditional

478
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
probability of the children of x given

479
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
all of their parents which include x

480
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,000
note the expectation includes the

481
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
children and parents of the children as

482
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
parents of the children x we divide by q

483
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,600
of x to ensure the expectation includes

484
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,640
the blanket only

485
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,679
so i think the messages are like all of

486
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,520
the things inside of the blanket send a

487
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
message to something else

488
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
in another blanket at least that's how i

489
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
interpret

490
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
um this

491
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,600
way of active inference and so

492
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,360
it would make sense that um

493
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
like from within the blanket does

494
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
everyone have the same is there like a

495
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,280
high degree of mutual information shared

496
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
in the markov blanket i think like

497
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,280
conditional dependence is what what um

498
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
you know qualifies as as

499
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
like conditional independence is what um

500
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
establishes the markup blanket so within

501
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
constituents under the blanket do they

502
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
all have all of the same information all

503
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,080
of the time that's something that's kind

504
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,960
of confusing to me

505
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
you know one thing i'd point out about

506
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,158
figure

507
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,240
4.3

508
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,520
so in the previous chapters

509
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,919
um you know we have this this picture of

510
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,039
there being the world and your model of

511
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,080
the world

512
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
and and that and those being

513
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
and your model of the world

514
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
is

515
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
a markov blanket itself and it

516
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,679
interfaces with the world through the

517
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,400
the um observation variables and the act

518
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
and the action variables

519
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
this picture doesn't have that breakdown

520
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,960
so it's got state there but it doesn't

521
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,559
say what is that is that state all

522
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
internal state is it external state or a

523
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,520
mixture of them and it's apparently it's

524
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,679
mixture because you've got policy that

525
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,600
can affect state which means that you're

526
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
going to have action is you know is

527
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,360
going to be part of the state transition

528
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,039
as well as and then you have the

529
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,520
observations coming out at the bottom

530
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,919
um but i think if we're going to talk

531
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,159
about markov blankets then i would like

532
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,600
to see this picture

533
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,159
be exploded into the internal you know

534
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,840
the state of the machine versus the

535
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,480
state of of the external world and how

536
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
those inter interact with one another

537
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
because that's what the markov blanket

538
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
does is it compartmentalizes the

539
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
information

540
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,400
well and and so that is the the pomdp uh

541
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,880
model and figure 4.3

542
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
um and this really figure 4.4 um

543
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,279
is like makes me scratch my head quite a

544
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,240
bit this is the image that is going to

545
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,799
um like represent

546
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,600
uh

547
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
message passing in a bayesian framework

548
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
and so um

549
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,960
the caption says on the right

550
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,120
dependencies between different variables

551
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
in the belief updating scheme outlined

552
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,919
in the main text

553
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,919
intuitively current beliefs about states

554
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,760
under each policy at each time are

555
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
compared with those that would be

556
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,600
predicted given beliefs about states at

557
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,039
other times this is one

558
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,120
and current outcomes to calculate

559
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,279
prediction errors these errors then

560
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,960
drive updating beliefs this is two

561
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
given beliefs about states under each

562
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,480
policy we can then calculate the

563
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
gradients of the expected free energy

564
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,559
this is three

565
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,360
um

566
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
these are combined with the outcomes

567
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
predicted under each policy omitted from

568
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
the figure to compute beliefs about

569
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,840
policies this is

570
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,480
for

571
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,400
and then using a bayesian model average

572
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,159
we can then compute posterior beliefs

573
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,960
about states averaged over policies this

574
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
is five

575
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,440
um

576
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
yeah

577
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,799
so

578
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
uh and this kind of leads us into the

579
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,039
next question but like i i i'm not able

580
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,840
to really interpret this figure 4.4 in

581
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,720
any better way so if anybody has like a

582
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,159
plain english

583
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
description of um how

584
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,720
this works i would love to hear it

585
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
we can also um we can talk a little bit

586
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
about um the a question that was raised

587
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
about this figure and also about this

588
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
like squiggle sigma

589
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
uh because there's a great like i don't

590
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,559
know i mean

591
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,200
we kind of had a hard time figuring out

592
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,840
the equation and the squiggle sigma and

593
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
what that actually stands for so we

594
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
could move to that

595
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,880
discussion because i think it's maybe

596
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,440
related to this message passing

597
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
discussion but let's read the discourse

598
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,200
here first

599
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,360
um on the

600
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,360
message passing question

601
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,679
so

602
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,880
in the discourse

603
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
what is the mechanism for signal decay

604
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
so this is um

605
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
information decay implementation of

606
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,559
information decay

607
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,559
is the message a thing behaving as an

608
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,279
active inference agent itself or a

609
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,640
special piece of information not

610
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
behaving as an active inference system

611
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,679
itself

612
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,240
is there a blanket impedance mismatch i

613
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
think brock contributed this i'm not

614
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
sure if he's here today

615
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,760
um and then message passing is

616
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,039
described through active inference

617
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,760
usually is a hierarchy not a lateral

618
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,240
transfer like within constituents in the

619
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,159
blanket so the key thing here is how you

620
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,320
define the markup blanket either there's

621
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,120
a petition partitioned between particles

622
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,399
cells or whatever or there's no

623
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,679
partition in blanket and everything

624
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,039
under the blanket is conditionally

625
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,520
dependent does conditional dependence

626
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
preclude message passing are message

627
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,600
passed within nodes in the same blanket

628
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
i have not seen this and would love if

629
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
someone pointed me to some references

630
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,120
so that's that was me i wrote the last

631
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
part um

632
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
because i haven't seen

633
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,159
message passing under the same markov

634
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,200
blanket it's always been like from one

635
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
markov blanket partitioned object to a

636
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,679
different markov blanket partitioned

637
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,080
object

638
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,799
but that moves us into um if anybody has

639
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,120
any comments feel free well i would say

640
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
message passing is used to do the

641
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,080
inference so it's within a markup

642
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
blanket i mean that's

643
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
that's pretty common i think in the

644
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
message in them

645
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,799
the way message passing is used

646
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,960
so here as it's shown in figure 4.4 like

647
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,600
although this is totally like beyond me

648
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
to describe

649
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,279
here this is a temporal message passing

650
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,960
so it's like from one time point to

651
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,799
another time point

652
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
um and then on the left it depicts the

653
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,399
hierarchical

654
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,960
um like a hierarchical expansion

655
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
collapsing over time steps but that a

656
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
higher level network might predict the

657
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
states and policies at the lower level

658
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,399
and use these to draw inferences about

659
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,039
the context in which these occur so the

660
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,799
way that i've always seen the message

661
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
passing used is from one time point to

662
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,919
another or from one layer of a hierarchy

663
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,080
to the next layer of a hierarchy and

664
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,480
i've not seen it passed within

665
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,440
like

666
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,279
constituents under the same markov

667
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,080
blanket so eric if you have references

668
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
that depict like some kind of message

669
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,399
passing in active inference that's not

670
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,159
through time steps or through

671
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
hierarchical levels i would love to see

672
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
that because i have not seen it

673
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,799
well i'll just look at go back to box

674
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,240
4.1

675
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
where they talk about the variational

676
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,600
message passing and how you

677
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
you get information and i would say

678
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,640
within a blanket you've got various

679
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,600
nodes

680
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
and they they have this hierarchical

681
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
parent child relations

682
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
and in order to do inference about hey

683
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,120
what's you know what's our belief in one

684
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,039
of these parents you got to kind of go

685
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,559
up and down and say well what are the

686
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,919
children of that and what do the other

687
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,600
parents think

688
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
so that's all within within a single

689
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,679
markov blanket the parents and children

690
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,360
the hierarchical relation and the

691
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,080
message passing happens to to circulate

692
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,399
that information within the blanket

693
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,520
that's how i i read

694
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,039
and i also put a link here to a paper by

695
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,559
champion at all

696
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,960
in which uh they have actually

697
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
explicitly

698
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,000
uh defined uh the active inference or

699
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
better say reformulated the active

700
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,919
inference formalism according to uh

701
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,039
variational message passing and uh if

702
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,679
you just give me a second i can find

703
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,799
uh exactly the place where

704
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,720
they have stated

705
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
this

706
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,559
in plain english

707
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,720
oh

708
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,159
you can continue with the other

709
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
questions if you like

710
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,320
but i need a moment to

711
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,799
check this paper sure yeah i'll check it

712
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
out also and yeah thank you for that so

713
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,240
like when i'm reading this variational

714
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,320
message passing this involves messages

715
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,080
from all constituents of the markov

716
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,559
blanket of x so the message is coming

717
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
from all the constituents in the blanket

718
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,159
but it doesn't say where the message is

719
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,440
going

720
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,760
so it does make sense like that i guess

721
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,840
it that it that it's an interchangeable

722
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,000
like or within would be a better word

723
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,559
than from like within all constituents

724
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,000
of the markov blanket because i was

725
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
reading it as like the message is coming

726
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,760
from everything under that blanket which

727
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,000
i guess is an incorrect interpretation

728
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,399
um so thank you eric for pointing that

729
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,360
out because i was like what

730
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,519
so this is um a really hard question

731
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,159
that i looked to try to answer um

732
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,679
actually a bunch of us looked yesterday

733
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,000
a lot so it says in equation 4.10

734
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
the sigma variable

735
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,880
um

736
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,720
squiggle sigma we'll call it whatever

737
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,559
i'm not sure how to say it

738
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,000
is used to describe the difference

739
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
between the natural log of observations

740
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,880
conditioned on policy and preferences

741
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,960
what is the function of this variable it

742
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,279
also comes up in figure 4.4 the message

743
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,120
passing figure we're just looking at and

744
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,559
it would be great to have a verbal

745
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,240
description of this figure what other

746
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
papers or equations use this squiggle

747
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,440
sigma and uh we looked at length like

748
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
through the entire textbook through um

749
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,519
the other chapters it refers to like

750
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,279
we'll unpack this later in chapter seven

751
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,559
we looked through chapter seven we

752
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,480
looked through the appendices we saw a

753
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
variable that almost looks like that but

754
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,760
i think it's a gamma it looks like a

755
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,679
little bit more fancy than this squiggle

756
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,080
sigma and could not find

757
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,360
that

758
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,519
at all so we went to unpack equation

759
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,320
410

760
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,880
um

761
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,399
and so

762
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
here is the

763
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,360
equation itself

764
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,559
um

765
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
i'm not sure how to put this up next to

766
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
the actually maybe i'll put up here

767
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
419.

768
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,760
so and this equation 4.10

769
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,480
is

770
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,519
a rewriting of equation 4.7 in linear

771
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,279
algebraic form

772
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,159
so

773
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,799
we tried to to kind of unpack this a

774
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,039
little bit so the first line

775
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,000
states the prior probability for each

776
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,960
policy this is that pi sub zero is equal

777
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,760
to the softmax function sigma times the

778
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
negative expected free energy g

779
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,760
um and so that's this first line the

780
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,039
next line

781
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,600
is the expected free energy conditioned

782
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
on policy g sub pi is equal to the

783
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,159
entropy or negative expected log

784
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,918
probability

785
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,480
h times the states conditioned on policy

786
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,079
and time which is s sub pi times tau or

787
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,639
both of those sub pi and tau

788
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,719
plus the observations conditioned on

789
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,480
policy and time this o sub pi times tau

790
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,280
times the beliefs conditioned on policy

791
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,480
and time

792
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,440
which is the squiggle sigma maybe sub pi

793
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,839
times tau so so we were kind of unsure

794
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,239
if beliefs is correct here we kind of

795
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,440
pulled that out of the um legend for

796
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,359
figure 4.4

797
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,560
but if anybody um knows and and just to

798
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
maybe unpack that a little bit more the

799
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,000
beliefs conditioned on policy and time

800
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,719
the squiggle sigma sub pi times tau is

801
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,239
equal to the difference between the

802
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,920
observations conditioned on policy and

803
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
time o sub pi times tau and preferences

804
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,160
conditioned on time c sub pi or sub tau

805
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,079
so we were unsure if belief is correct

806
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,680
here also

807
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,480
um

808
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,599
and so if anybody knows if beliefs is um

809
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,520
the difference between observations and

810
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,280
preferences that would be great to have

811
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
some kind of feedback or input here

812
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
because we couldn't really reach a

813
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,160
conclusion

814
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
well i just i guess one one

815
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
tiny step

816
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,839
uh toward figuring this out i would say

817
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:08,960
is that

818
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
um that funny squiggle thing there

819
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,760
has to do with the c

820
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,880
we've got uh we've got this

821
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,440
probability of observations given c and

822
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,359
c is this mysterious object that

823
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,760
expresses preferences which has also

824
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
been underexplained

825
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,160
that's so if you look at the two terms

826
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
of

827
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,880
the

828
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
expected free energy g

829
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,760
as a function of a function of policy

830
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
and 4.7 and then look at how it looks

831
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,520
like in 4.10 that sigma thing there

832
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,920
is

833
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,400
is it is expressed as is

834
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,480
we've got the dot which i guess is a

835
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,240
multiplier

836
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
by observation so that's the same as

837
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,040
that's like saying your probability of

838
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
observation given c so that's i guess a

839
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,839
major matrix multiplied version of

840
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,280
the um this log probability of um

841
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,960
sequence of observations given your

842
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
preference

843
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
preference

844
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,800
prior c

845
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,720
yeah so they do unpack it a little bit

846
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,520
more in equation

847
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,520
4.7 or it seems to be like maybe we

848
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,160
could extrapolate from 4.7 if this is

849
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,040
beliefs because it is this natural log

850
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,520
of observations minus the natural log of

851
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,359
preferences but but up in the top that

852
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,520
just the free energy is um the entropy

853
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,960
or the maybe the dot product of the

854
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,599
entropy times the states

855
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,680
plus the observations

856
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,119
times or the dot product of the

857
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,520
observations and

858
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,359
maybe beliefs here um so i've not seen

859
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,680
like i can't recall a mathematical

860
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,760
representation of belief ever using this

861
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,680
squiggle sigma before and i looked

862
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,400
through

863
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,560
um the recent ryan smith paper and i

864
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
looked even at like the message passing

865
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,560
paper by fristen

866
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,280
and i was not able to really get any

867
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,800
additional like

868
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,599
references to this squiggle sigma at all

869
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,440
so why do you say belief as opposed to

870
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,960
preferences

871
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,800
well so it says here that um

872
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,880
the squiggle sigma

873
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,760
is

874
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,599
equal to the difference between the

875
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,440
natural log of the observations

876
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,079
conditioned on policy and time

877
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,880
and the natural log of the preferences

878
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,119
at at a certain time

879
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,920
so the sigma is defined by the natural

880
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,240
log of the preferences but it's more

881
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
than just the preferences

882
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,240
does that make sense eric

883
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,359
yeah

884
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,359
but that's not same as belief right

885
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,440
that's that's observations versus

886
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
preferences

887
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
right so the difference like

888
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,640
rate from

889
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,200
expected deviation or how much risk is

890
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,280
being taken relative to

891
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,599
the policy that's applied so because i

892
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,680
i mean it's the dot product is between

893
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,079
the observation and

894
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,880
that's wiggle sigma right so which is in

895
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,079
turn

896
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:24,800
like

897
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,040
okay this is what i've observed this is

898
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
this is what i expected so it's like a

899
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
divergence between the two

900
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
so how much more risk am i taking and

901
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,839
how far is just pushing me away from my

902
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,400
cream from minimizing free energy

903
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,320
so maybe it's something like that

904
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
whereas belief is wrapped up in the s

905
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,560
because that's that's your model you

906
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,200
know of the world

907
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,440
so risk is maybe the how the the

908
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,200
squiggle sigma is defined but then if

909
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,599
you look into this figure 4.4 like

910
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,920
that's that's why we used belief

911
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
so here let's let's i'll pull it up

912
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,000
right now

913
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,119
so i'm not sure how easy this is to see

914
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,640
but um

915
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,200
in the before we get to number one here

916
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
we have like at the second on the right

917
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,640
hand side the second to lowest level

918
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,319
is um

919
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,720
states conditioned on

920
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,319
policy and time i think i'm going to

921
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,079
read it off this bigger screen oh yeah

922
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,000
states conditioned on policy and time at

923
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,079
different time steps so like the the

924
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,839
current time is in the middle

925
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,359
the forward time step is on the right

926
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,800
and the backward time step is on the

927
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,920
left

928
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
um and so that's what we start with

929
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,000
so

930
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,520
intuitively current beliefs about states

931
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
under each policy at each time are

932
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
compared with those that would be

933
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
predicted given beliefs about states at

934
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,560
other times

935
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,359
um

936
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,720
so

937
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,119
maybe beliefs is this s well so and

938
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,200
that's kind of what what eric was saying

939
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,680
um and we know because it's defined

940
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,400
earlier this epsilon here is

941
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,880
a prediction error right so so what we

942
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,680
come to after step one it says and

943
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,520
current outcomes to calculate prediction

944
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,599
errors that's what we arrive at after

945
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,880
number one

946
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,440
um the errors then drive updating in the

947
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,520
beliefs that's number two so here we go

948
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,000
from the current state at at the present

949
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,880
time to a prediction error that drives

950
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,400
the belief updating

951
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,359
at this forward time step after number

952
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,480
two

953
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,440
um and then it says given beliefs about

954
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,599
states under each policy

955
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,520
we can then calculate the gradients of

956
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,359
expected free energy

957
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,000
three so so what gives us this gradient

958
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,400
of expected expected free energy is it

959
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,760
this

960
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,200
s sub type so s sub tau plus one or is

961
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,079
that a tau what i think that's a tau

962
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,119
let's see

963
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,560
yeah

964
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,880
so is it a future state not conditioned

965
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,200
on policy or here we get to this

966
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,400
squiggle sigma so it's a squiggle sigma

967
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,680
conditioned on policy and time plus one

968
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,160
so it looks like a belief update there

969
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,720
which is why belief made sense

970
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,520
so is that a risk update is that a

971
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,720
possible

972
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,400
interpretation there in this message

973
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,800
passing figure

974
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,880
well they say it's a gradient

975
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,560
which means it's saying

976
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,680
how much do we have to change our policy

977
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,880
i think in order to get uh our

978
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,640
objectives

979
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,119
yeah gradient makes sense to me as well

980
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,200
because uh it's how much information

981
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,560
you've gained right

982
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,800
so if you actually look at the change in

983
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,440
the state with respect to

984
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,240
so i apply some

985
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,640
let's say force or like let's just take

986
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,960
a simple example like if you have an

987
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
actuator

988
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,599
that just the applies force

989
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,720
and

990
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,000
all it does is

991
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,319
move moves forward and has to follow a

992
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,680
trajectory

993
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,720
so

994
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,319
the error is so at each time step if

995
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,640
it's a deterministic system you expect

996
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,160
it to follow a straight line and it's

997
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,960
deviating up away so that's epsilon

998
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
so you have to update okay this is how

999
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,599
far up i am from the state

1000
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,119
that i'm supposed to be so i need to

1001
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,520
apply slightly less

1002
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,599
force or maybe a

1003
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,160
force in a different direction

1004
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,520
and

1005
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,680
that seems so

1006
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,000
it's also how much i have to over

1007
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,920
correct in the future depending on what

1008
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,440
i've done

1009
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,079
currently right it's not just

1010
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,079
uh so

1011
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,720
if if i've applied some force right now

1012
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,720
i might deviate in the opposite

1013
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,800
direction and i have to come back so

1014
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
i have to figure out how much force to

1015
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,000
apply so

1016
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,359
that's why i said

1017
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,160
risk or yeah gradient

1018
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,000
you would have to take the

1019
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
uh change with respect to

1020
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
the state change with respect to the

1021
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,880
error so yeah that would be one

1022
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,319
interpretation of it right so it's a

1023
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,319
gradient

1024
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,319
of the state change with respect to what

1025
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,200
you have done

1026
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,720
so i also heard the term information

1027
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,079
gain in there um yeah yeah i mean i i

1028
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,160
mean i'm just generally saying so in

1029
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,960
neural networks for example we would

1030
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,440
have like some sort of loss function

1031
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,319
and we would calculate the weight change

1032
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,040
with respect to the change of the loss

1033
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,720
function right so like i have a weight

1034
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,319
vector and then

1035
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,160
uh this particular example is giving me

1036
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,920
a certain amount of gradient

1037
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,240
and i need to minimize this gradient so

1038
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,480
i need to change the weights in turn so

1039
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,400
the gradient actually

1040
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,319
interfaces between this loss function

1041
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,079
and all these weights

1042
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,800
so effectively the gradient passes on

1043
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,040
information as to how much the weight

1044
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,880
has to change in order to minimize that

1045
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,000
loss function that's why i said

1046
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,480
information

1047
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,440
and also as a side note

1048
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
i think i found

1049
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,720
this

1050
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,040
sigma in ryan smith's paper too uh and

1051
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,480
it is defined as the expected prediction

1052
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,880
error

1053
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,880
so

1054
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,280
the expected prediction error versus the

1055
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,359
actual prediction error like and and

1056
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,960
they distinguish it from epsilon in the

1057
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,720
ryan smith paper because i i did look at

1058
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,200
that but i didn't find it in there yeah

1059
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,720
it's in question in equation 27

1060
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
under the section outcome prediction

1061
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,720
errors

1062
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
it may be that the expected means it's

1063
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,680
an expectation over the um

1064
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,760
the q distribution which is your

1065
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
distribution over

1066
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,079
um

1067
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,720
belief states

1068
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,359
yeah that's great ali like we were um we

1069
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,440
ali and i and um some others worked on

1070
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
this yesterday

1071
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,920
a lot and uh it's great that it kept you

1072
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,520
up late at night clearly ellie so you

1073
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,599
went digging around for

1074
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,000
for some more information that's awesome

1075
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,560
yeah great okay perfect well that's that

1076
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,480
resolves that very well

1077
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,599
um

1078
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,839
and then let's get into maybe the next

1079
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,319
question

1080
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,160
um

1081
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,960
all right

1082
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,400
so in equation 4.16

1083
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,720
the x has a dot over it changed through

1084
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,359
time but not the y

1085
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,960
data

1086
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,119
so there's some um

1087
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,319
discourse on this

1088
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,440
or maybe we should go to the next

1089
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,640
question actually because it's maybe

1090
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,240
more related so

1091
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,559
figure 4.6 uses an epsilon for

1092
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,319
prediction error as described in

1093
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,800
equation 4.21

1094
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,200
is this predictive processing framing a

1095
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,359
part of the active inference model

1096
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,760
or is this presented for contrast to

1097
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,000
illustrate the simile similarities and

1098
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,319
differences between active inference and

1099
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,400
predictive processing

1100
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,599
so this is equation 4.1 and this is the

1101
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,240
epsilon but i think we see it way before

1102
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,200
equation 4.21 like it's even there in

1103
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,399
equation 4.4

1104
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,400
um it says this predictive coding schema

1105
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,240
is part of the active inference model

1106
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,000
illustrating the hierarchical structure

1107
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,319
of predictions and beliefs the authors

1108
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,640
say one way to think about this is as if

1109
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,480
we had equipped a predictive coding

1110
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,200
scheme with classical reflex arcs at the

1111
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,040
lowest level of the hierarchy and they

1112
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,480
give this reference

1113
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
in this setting active inference is just

1114
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,839
predictive coding plus reflex arcs

1115
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,839
does anybody know what a reflex arc is

1116
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,520
because i'm a little bit lost with

1117
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,760
respect to that or have any comments on

1118
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,880
this prediction yeah reflex reflex arc

1119
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,319
is uh

1120
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,760
well basically

1121
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,680
the stimuli that doesn't go through the

1122
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,240
sensory cortex

1123
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,599
i thought it was like a mathematical

1124
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,599
construct

1125
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,960
maybe you think of it as a control

1126
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,359
system

1127
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,280
no thinking it's just

1128
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,680
it's like you know you bang your knee

1129
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,839
your foot goes

1130
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,240
up yeah that makes sense and it says we

1131
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,000
we minimize three energy free energy

1132
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
through action and the only part of the

1133
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,920
free energy that depends on action is

1134
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,599
the lowest level of prediction error in

1135
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
this hierarchical schema

1136
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,520
action fulfills descending predictions

1137
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,280
by minimizing the error between the

1138
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,880
predicted and observed sensory data

1139
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,440
any additional comments here about

1140
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,440
predictive coding and active inference

1141
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
or we can look at this equation 4.16 the

1142
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,559
x has the dot over it change through

1143
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,640
time but not the y data

1144
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,280
why is this

1145
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,319
um

1146
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,640
and here the discourse says

1147
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,599
the top equation depends on f x and v

1148
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,200
which is a deterministic function

1149
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,960
describing how a hidden state changes

1150
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,000
over time

1151
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,559
the bottom equation depends on g of x

1152
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,400
and v which describes how data are

1153
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,880
generated from a single hidden state the

1154
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,200
tilde indicates change through time the

1155
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,759
dot indicates the first order derivative

1156
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,720
any uh

1157
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,119
comments here on this equation or your

1158
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,119
question

1159
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,598
thank you

1160
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,559
so maybe we can ask one more question or

1161
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,720
maybe a couple more so here it says on

1162
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,359
page 63 it says specifically the

1163
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,599
bayesian brain helps us frame the

1164
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,359
problems that an agent engaging in

1165
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,440
active inference must solve broadly

1166
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,119
these are the problem of inferring

1167
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,720
states of the world perception and

1168
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,119
inferring a course of action planning

1169
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,640
other than perception and action

1170
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,559
planning are there other tasks or

1171
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,559
challenges that the brain or organisms

1172
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,680
engage in

1173
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,559
how would we know

1174
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,480
there's no discourse here but let's open

1175
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,680
it up and see what you guys think

1176
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,800
um yeah um people uh wonder hey uh

1177
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,760
what's on that star out there

1178
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,680
that's neither

1179
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,200
i don't know is that is that inferring

1180
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,280
state of the world i guess

1181
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,839
not planning

1182
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,680
and it could just be a hallucination of

1183
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,480
the

1184
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,400
generative model you're not really

1185
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,920
measuring anything you're just measuring

1186
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,040
yourself over and over again

1187
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,839
that could be one thing

1188
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,480
okay so here there's another question

1189
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,640
for each of the graphical models in

1190
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,079
figure 4.2 what is an intuitive example

1191
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,119
for each structure

1192
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,520
one would be disease diagnosis right

1193
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,280
so you have symptom

1194
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
that is causative of

1195
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,359
or predictive of some condition

1196
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,079
i think that was the example that they

1197
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,280
gave in the text right

1198
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,319
or did we talk about this last week

1199
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,640
maybe

1200
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,720
yeah i actually don't get the question

1201
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,480
because reach of them we have an example

1202
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,400
at least an example in the text so

1203
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,040
yeah that's true

1204
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,640
and i think we're going to maybe see

1205
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,720
more examples as we go through the book

1206
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,359
but just in case if anyone wants to see

1207
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,640
some more examples uh actually that

1208
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,280
paper i put the link in the chat

1209
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
realizing active inference and variation

1210
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,960
message passing

1211
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,720
contains some more examples for each of

1212
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,200
these diagrams

1213
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,200
this is a fun last question maybe

1214
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,119
um

1215
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,920
it says

1216
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,000
this reiterates that active inference

1217
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,079
uses two constructs variational free

1218
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,160
energy and expected free energy which

1219
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,760
are mathematically related but play

1220
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,400
distinct and complementary roles in your

1221
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,160
own words what are the definitions of

1222
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,920
variable variational free energy and

1223
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,760
expected free energy and what role do

1224
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,240
they play individually or together in

1225
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,558
active inference

1226
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,040
uh my view of expected free energy was

1227
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,079
uh given a certain action that might be

1228
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,200
taken it might produce this

1229
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,640
or reduce the free energy or something

1230
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,280
or it talks about some future

1231
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,200
uh reduction on the free energy or

1232
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,799
something like that

1233
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,960
variational free energy is more

1234
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,160
objective

1235
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,520
i don't know how to put it so it's like

1236
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,599
it's like okay actual kinetic energy

1237
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,160
versus perceived kinetic energy kind of

1238
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,319
thing

1239
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,680
so you're rolling down a hill

1240
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,280
uh yeah

1241
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,400
like a ball rolling down a hill we can

1242
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,640
actually measure

1243
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,520
the kinetic energy at the bottom of the

1244
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,040
hill right

1245
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,359
if you put the ball at the top

1246
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,680
expected free energy would be like

1247
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,920
using a model to calculate that and then

1248
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,680
finding out it

1249
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,119
actually

1250
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,760
corresponds if you look at the model

1251
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,480
at least that's my view

1252
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,480
so i don't know and probably like i

1253
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,680
think about this in a lot of different

1254
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,359
ways but

1255
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,880
i think about like variational free

1256
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,400
energy i mean this is one way to think

1257
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,359
about it is like um

1258
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,680
maximizing like the the trade-off

1259
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,480
between epistemic value and pragmatic

1260
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,720
value like right now and expected for

1261
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,799
free energy is like maximizing that

1262
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,559
difference at some point in the future

1263
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,760
so you can like plan ahead like it might

1264
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
be cold out so i'm going to take a

1265
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,880
jacket

1266
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,400
or like it's cold right now i'm going to

1267
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,839
put my jacket on

1268
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:50,960
um

1269
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,559
those are kind of like that's how i

1270
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,400
think about the difference between those

1271
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,359
two

1272
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,760
so it's ten thanks everyone for coming i

1273
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,240
hope i didn't um you know muddle this up

1274
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,480
too much uh trying to be a substitute

1275
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,000
teacher for daniel um and uh it's ten so

1276
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,760
we're gonna have tools right now in this

1277
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,480
room but if anybody wants to continue

1278
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,040
discussing these ideas and gather you're

1279
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,240
welcome to

1280
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,640
migrate up to one of the different

1281
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,880
spaces

1282
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,400
yeah and i think we'll stop the

1283
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,839
recording now alex if you haven't

1284
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,799
already
