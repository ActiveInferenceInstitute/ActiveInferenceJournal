250	55614	00:00	Of these questions. I'm not sure if we talked about this question. In the discussion of active inference in POMDP t belief updating about policies, we find that the posterior that minimizes the free energy does the posterior at time t. I think we did not discuss pi being a policy or a model last time.	Of these questions. Okay, so we talked about belief, policy, state	POMDP 3, Belief and State
55732	393590	00:55	The question is, which is it, policy or model? The authors suggest a rewrite of the sentence. We should treat the pi as policy, but it behaves as a model. Once it's executed, it's implemented. Then the model has become a function of the policy.	Question: Which is policy or model in this book	Applying Pi to the Model

The reason behind using the categorical distribution might be to jettison any orderness in the elements and treat them as just an unordered set of the probabilities.

616840	1166490	10:16	Eric: Isn't the categorical notation special case of multinomial distribution? Steven: The mathematical notation doesn't have an ordering. It just says distribution is related to another distribution through this relation. Some of the new math is using some of the affordances from category theory.

1175470	1304200	19:35	Is there a decay of information as the distance between the variable X and individual Markov blanket constituents increases? Is implementation of information decay? in message passing an option for model implementation?

1307580	1466190	21:47	Markov blankets and the message passing. This involves messages from all constituents of the Markov blanket of X, including the parents via the conditional probability of X given its parents and the children. I would like to see this picture be exploded into the state of the machine and how those interact with one another.

1472930	1614076	24:32	Figure 4.4 makes me scratch my head quite a bit. This is the image that is going to represent message passing in a Bayesian framework. If anybody has like a plain English description of how this works, I would love to hear it.

1614108	2432620	26:54	Message passing as described through active inference usually is a hierarchy, not a lateral transfer like within constituents in the blanket. Does conditional dependence preclude message passing? I have not seen this and would love to see some references.	Let's read the discourse here first on the message passing question	Markov message passing under active inference
2433150	2828240	40:33	The figure shows states conditioned on policy and time at different time steps. Current beliefs about states under each policy at each time are compared with those that would be predicted. The errors then drive updating in the beliefs. Is that a risk update? Or is it a gradient?

2829570	3180600	47:09	Figure 4.6 uses an epsilon for prediction error as described in equation 4.21. Is this predictive processing framing a part of the active inference model or is this presented for contrast? Other than perception and action planning, are there other tasks or challenges that the brain or organisms engage in?

That paper, Active Inference in Variation Message Passing contains some more examples for each of these diagrams.	What is an intuitive example for each structure?

But if anybody wants to continue discussing these ideas and gather, you're welcome to migrate up to one of the different spaces.
