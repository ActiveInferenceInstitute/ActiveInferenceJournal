970	25640	00:00	Hello everyone. It's october 7, 2022. We are in meeting 19 for cohort one and we're discussing chapter eight. So there's a bunch of questions and also a lot of things to talk about. Let us just begin with looking at chapter 8.	We are in meeting 19 for cohort one discussing chapter eight	C cohort one
26170	66450	00:26	So does anybody want to give any first thoughts on active inference in continuous time? Everything flows, nothing stands still, et cetera? Once we get to about 8.3, I'll weigh in.	Anyone want to give any first thoughts on active inference in continuous time	Active Inferring in Continuous Time
68310	204930	01:08	The textbook tries to give equal time and highlight the hybridization of these models. Certain areas like motor reflexes, where there's more of a tradition of continuous models are heavily represented in them. Decision making models tend to use the discrete formalisms.	The textbook highlights the hybridization of continuous and discrete time models	Extracting Continuous Time from Psychology: Introduction
207800	594436	03:27	The focus here is on continuous states based models which are well suited for physical fluctuations, sensory receptors and continuous motion of effectors. Action is absent from equation 8.1. This is because Action is part of the generative process, not the Generative model. Can you consider your own actions part of what gets observed under that framework?

594618	1027610	09:54	The difference between italics versus bold GNF is that V, the static variables have been replaced with U actions. The functions GNF are not necessarily the same as those used to define the generative process. The scheme does not require specification of inverse models that are widely used in other formulations of motor control.	First question is about italics versus bold GNF. Do you think that that matters? I don't think it matters	Inclination and generative process in motor control
1029100	1416100	17:09	Continuous time formulations are well suited to characterization of movements. But that's assuming that the equilibrium point control model is a good characterization of movement. Many, if not most human movements or any motor movements are ballistic.	Continuous time formulations are well suited to characterization of movements, Eric says	Equilibrium Point Control for Motor Movement
1417960	1746620	23:37	We're preparing also for 50, which is using it's also by Feldman, Barrett and others. And it's specifically on interoceptive reflexes. Using those kinds of still classical, very differential, equation based equilibria control. Do those models integrate sensory and action together?	Using equations based equilibria control to predict behavior is difficult	Interoceptive reflexes and their active inference
1751620	1896188	29:11	In many ways, this concept of precision is more naturally addressed in a continuous time setting. Can't you do a LaPlace approximation in discrete systems as well? Is it that precision is a continuous variable?	In the box 81, they write about precision in continuous time systems	Precision in continuous-time systems
1896194	2095230	31:36	Lock of voltera ties in of course with ecology and population ecologies. Also interesting to consider in terms of winnerless competitions and neural dynamics. Taylor series does expansion of arbitrary functions from a starting point. Can also include a window of inputs also known as the memory effect.	Lock of voltera dynamics can give oscillation and time structure	Lock of Voltera Dynamics and Lorenz Systems
2096480	2553460	34:56	How is the Lockable Terra model being used in the case of handwriting? Left eye blink, conditioning. sequential peaks using an attracting point. This leads to sequential visiting of each points, giving rise to a type of handwriting. The case of motor motor control was discussed at the CPC 2022.	How is the Lockable Terra model being used in the case of handwriting	Handwriting and Bayesian Inference
2554410	3050010	42:34	P OMDP has largely superseded the use of the generalized Lotka volterra systems in active inference applications. How do discrete and continuous models interface? Where are what kinds of transitions between continuous and discrete state spaces possible?	Dalton: How do discrete and continuous models interface	Active Inference 6, Continuous and Mixed Models
3055710	3389668	50:55	Singing from the same pre coordinated hymn sheet is not the same thing as information updating or even just pure expressivity. We need some bird watching, active inference practitioners to develop the bird song motif.	Eric: I have serious questions about the bird song chapter in this book	Inferring Bird Song: Synchronization
3389834	3451650	56:29	So next week, I guess this is kind of a shorter chapter and it has some arcane symbolism, but also seemingly very skippable symbolism. So I'm glad that we could get through the whole thing and we'll return to any further thoughts on eight. Thanks, everyone.	This chapter has some arcane symbolism, but also seemingly very skippable symbolism	7 + 8: A Synthesis
