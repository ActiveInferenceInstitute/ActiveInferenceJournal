00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,886
Hello everyone. It's october 7,

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:07,754
2022. We are in meeting 19

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:11,114
for cohort one and we're discussing

4
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:15,834
chapter eight. So there's

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,406
a bunch of questions and also a lot

6
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:22,494
of things to talk about. Let us just

7
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,998
begin with looking at chapter eight.

8
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:28,262
Eight. So does anybody

9
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,054
want to give any first

10
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,542
thoughts on active inference in

11
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:37,522
continuous time? Everything flows,

12
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:40,230
nothing stands still, et cetera?

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,080
Yes.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,320
Not on that specifically. Okay,

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,638
but I will have something to say for

16
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:57,070
this chapter. I worked on this topic

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,358
during my graduate time. So once we

18
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,780
get to about 8.3, I'll weigh in.

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,450
Excellent.

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,982
Any comments like discrete

21
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,146
continuous time? I know this is

22
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:15,846
something we'll touch on again and

23
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:16,440
again.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,052
It's kind of like another low road,

25
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:33,352
high road duality with

26
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,136
continuous and discrete time. And I

27
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:39,020
think the textbook tries to give equal

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,420
time and highlight the hybridization

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,372
of these models in a way where

30
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:50,070
realistically in the literature most

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,420
are pure discrete models and

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,552
continuous time models have been

33
00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:00,840
almost like domain bound.

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,732
Certain areas like motor reflexes,

35
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,544
where there's more of a tradition of

36
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:11,580
continuous models are heavily

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,224
represented in them, whereas decision

38
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:18,456
making models tend to use the discrete

39
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:21,852
formalisms. And that difference between

40
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,712
the sort of like continuous time

41
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,016
traditionally motor associated and

42
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:28,764
discrete categorical traditionally

43
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:32,464
decision oriented models was

44
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:36,400
addressed in the Folk Psychology

45
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,716
paper and Live Stream with Ryan Smith et

46
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:44,710
al. Okay, also I

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,716
just started kind of an overview, got up

48
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:51,592
through 83 of just

49
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:54,152
understanding and just trying to lay out

50
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,260
chapter eight. So for any chapter,

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,490
everyone's always welcome to just

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,260
make summaries and add their own notes

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,350
so we can look at the questions,

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,256
many of which are on the earlier part of

55
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:19,056
the chapter. And so maybe we can look at

56
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:21,792
the earlier part of the chapter more

57
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:24,176
this week and of course then have later

58
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:24,930
time.

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,468
Okay, so 8.1,

60
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:33,860
it's a single paragraph,

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,372
it's a complement to chapter seven,

62
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,364
which was a discrete time approach

63
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,580
towards generative model construction.

64
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,712
The focus here is on continuous states

65
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,544
based models which are well suited for

66
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:48,292
physical fluctuations, sensory receptors

67
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:50,920
and continuous motion of effectors.

68
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,476
They start with the case of movement

69
00:03:56,508 --> 00:04:01,260
control 8.2. So let's

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,600
get familiar with the notation.

71
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,164
The states, hidden states are

72
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:11,936
going to be X. The data, the observables

73
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:15,652
are going to be Y. And then how states

74
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,812
evolve over time depends on a static

75
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:21,192
variable V. So that could be a hidden or

76
00:04:21,246 --> 00:04:23,896
slower changing cause or factor in the

77
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,188
environment. Then we have the omega

78
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:30,040
terms associated with each of the data

79
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,944
and the hidden states change through

80
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:35,932
time. And that variability is

81
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:37,756
like the noise and this is like the

82
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,548
signal or the flow. So it's kind of the

83
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:41,656
length of an decomposition or a length

84
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:45,644
of an approach towards dynamical systems

85
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:46,560
modeling.

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,632
One interesting thing to note is first

87
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:56,980
that this is hugely forsaged in SPM.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,070
Then also that the data

89
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,924
are a function of the states at that

90
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,528
time, whereas the equation for the

91
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:12,052
hidden states is a change in hidden

92
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:18,436
states. X dot note

93
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,310
that Action is absent from equation 8.1.

94
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,036
This is because Action is part of the

95
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,984
generative process, not the generative

96
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:30,284
model. Thought that

97
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:33,250
was kind of an interesting question.

98
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,736
What does that mean? That Action is part

99
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:38,336
of the generative process and not the

100
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,410
generative model?

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,696
Surely Action selection is part of the

102
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,750
generative model,

103
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,356
the cognitive process of policy

104
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,460
inference.

105
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,280
Active states are part of the

106
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,576
particular states. Active states are

107
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:02,650
blanket states.

108
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,412
Particular states are the generative

109
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:08,090
model.

110
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,250
The generative process is referring to

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,700
the external states, the hidden states.

112
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,774
So is Action part of both the generative

113
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,854
process and the generative model because

114
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,118
it kind of sits in between

115
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:30,630
intermediates? Or is this referring

116
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,950
to the consequences?

117
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,026
The generative model only deals with

118
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,914
those variables directly influenced by

119
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:42,570
states external to a Markov blanket.

120
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,422
So is that saying that the generative

121
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:51,678
model is kind of like the complement of

122
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,346
the autonomous states, Action internal

123
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:57,630
states? Or is this even more extreme?

124
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,994
It's only dealing with the variables

125
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,998
directly influenced by states external

126
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:04,338
to a markup blanket. So then it must

127
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,660
only deal with sense states,

128
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,246
which is like a narrow perceptual

129
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,410
control reading.

130
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,000
And in that sense,

131
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,646
Action execution is outside

132
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,886
of the generative model because the

133
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,210
generative model is only dealing with

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,330
observations.

135
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,082
Does anyone have thoughts on how

136
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,982
generative model, Action and generative

137
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,890
process are being used? Eric.

138
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,582
I wonder if you can consider your own

139
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:49,582
actions part of what gets observed under

140
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,670
that framework.

141
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,266
As far as I would, the apologetics for

142
00:07:57,288 --> 00:08:01,060
the narrow view would be exactly that,

143
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,502
which is like you have proprioceptors

144
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,650
in your elbow, so you don't observe

145
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,282
Action, but you are getting continuous

146
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:14,390
updating of perceptions that are

147
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,686
extremely influenced by Action. But the

148
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,414
hidden state of the world is actually

149
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:22,586
like the angle of your elbow. And so

150
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:25,926
you're not directly observing the hidden

151
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,994
state of the world nor how it changes.

152
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:30,826
All you have is the proprioceptors. And

153
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:33,242
of course, you engage in policies to

154
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,906
change your appropriate receptors,

155
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,278
bring them towards alignment, which is

156
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,606
what we're going to be discussing in the

157
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:42,590
chapter. Ali, I saw your hand raise.

158
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,420
Yeah, I wanted to mention exactly the

159
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,474
proprioception which you mentioned, so I

160
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,578
lowered my hand. Okay,

161
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:55,700
yeah, great.

162
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,222
But then could you include the fact that

163
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,526
you've got signals going to your

164
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,538
muscles, your motor signals and motor

165
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:07,638
neurons firing in there, making your

166
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,526
muscles contract? Can that be part of

167
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:12,290
your observation to say, well, okay, if

168
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,638
this is happening, that these muscles

169
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,002
are getting activated, then sure enough,

170
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,286
the arm moves and appropriate section

171
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:22,378
changes. So you can say, well, from the

172
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:25,594
outside of that box, that's all

173
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,460
part of the generative model,

174
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,802
but not part of generating those muscle

175
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,058
commands, but just seeing what the

176
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,266
effect of them is. I wonder if that

177
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,170
would be an acceptable viewpoint.

178
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,784
Cool. We'll return to this like where

179
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,876
is Action? What is action. But I think

180
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,408
it's just important to note while we're

181
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:57,376
early here. Okay, so continuing

182
00:09:57,408 --> 00:10:00,484
a little bit on this part, I thought was

183
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:03,544
also a little curious. Okay.

184
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:06,072
So this is equation 8.1. We mentioned

185
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,764
equation 82. So first question, italics

186
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:11,880
versus bold GNF.

187
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Do you think that that matters?

188
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,570
I don't think it matters.

189
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,516
Does anyone disagree? Do you think it's

190
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:32,500
moving from one space to another space?

191
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,668
Or do you think that's just a

192
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,100
typographical error?

193
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,316
I think it can be considered as an

194
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:44,180
eradica.

195
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,496
One thing I did notice is that 8.3 and

196
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,532
8.4, the italics they call a generative

197
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:55,552
model, and 8.4 they call a generative

198
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:58,556
process without the italics. Could that

199
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:01,580
be the distinction? Okay,

200
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,444
8.3 and four. Yeah.

201
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,230
Okay.

202
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,888
It's a very good question. Well, let's

203
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:15,470
just say italics in 8.1 and three,

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,870
bold in 8.2 and 8.4,

205
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,730
unclear, if relevant difference.

206
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,290
Okay.

207
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,010
If the meta model you say, frames it.

208
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,858
So if you consider the niche to be a

209
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,480
metamodel, then sure.

210
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,454
The difference between equation one and

211
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,560
two, other than the bolding or not,

212
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,862
is that V, the static

213
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:15,938
variables have been replaced with U

214
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:19,634
actions. So this takes us from, like,

215
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,126
the sort of SPM where you'd be like,

216
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:25,846
you have neuroimaging data Y as a

217
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:28,150
function of underlying neural states x.

218
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,534
And then neural states changing through

219
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:33,206
time are a function of neural states at

220
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:37,370
that time and some conditional factor

221
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,474
that you're testing for, like whether

222
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:41,946
they were exposed to treatment one or

223
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:45,354
treatment two. V so this

224
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:49,658
is still a partially observable

225
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:53,182
dynamical model, but then it gets

226
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,678
moved very neatly into the control

227
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:59,158
theoretic and the policy selectionist

228
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:02,002
inference space by just saying, yeah,

229
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,954
those slowly changing factors that

230
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,940
influence how the hidden states change,

231
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,234
we control those, or we have some

232
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:11,460
ability to influence there.

233
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,620
Okay.

234
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,586
Yeah. So this could be a cue towards the

235
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:23,046
Bulls difference, which is, like, the

236
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,962
functions GNF are not necessarily

237
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,458
the same as those used to define the

238
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,442
generative process. If they said not

239
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:31,946
necessarily the same as those used to

240
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:34,234
define the generative process, bold, G,

241
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,606
and F, then it would be unambiguous.

242
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:40,090
But it's a little ambiguous.

243
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,446
We do not need to explicitly write down

244
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:48,842
the dynamics of action in the generative

245
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:49,520
model.

246
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,996
Okay. They emerge

247
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,536
from the choices made for terms in

248
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,090
equation 8.1.

249
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,586
We start with a simple sort of

250
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:12,126
generative model. So G,

251
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:14,074
which is the function that's generating

252
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:17,600
the data, is going to be x

253
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,200
F.

254
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,634
The function of how X changes through

255
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:28,930
time is a function of

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,810
X and V, the slower changing causes,

257
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,140
and it's a difference between those two.

258
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,914
The hidden state represents the expected

259
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,718
value for the data. Or another way to

260
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,654
say that would be equation three says

261
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,942
that the expected value for the data are

262
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:48,106
the hidden state, but those are the

263
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,970
same, and it's a point attractor.

264
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,706
Or in the Bayesian mechanics, we could

265
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:58,986
say it's mode matching by

266
00:14:59,008 --> 00:14:59,930
attractor.

267
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,200
Yeah.

268
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,684
Yes. The the attractor here is the mode

269
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:14,470
tracking that is being referred to here.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,388
When there's a difference between the

271
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:18,804
hidden state and the hidden cause, V,

272
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,564
then it moves towards it.

273
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,724
So it's just moving towards a single

274
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,136
fixed point attractor. Now the

275
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:29,960
generative process is defined,

276
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,200
so it looks almost identical,

277
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,690
except V's are replaced with use.

278
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,360
And this differential tracker,

279
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,932
this kind of PID control motif, is

280
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,260
replaced with action.

281
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,364
It's an expression of the equilibrium

282
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:55,596
point hypothesis, which treats motor

283
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:57,936
control as enacted by reflex arcs that

284
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,920
draw limbs towards equilibrium points

285
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,160
set by descending motor signals.

286
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,156
And then also this is related to the

287
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,470
skilled performance live stream 23.

288
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,532
The scheme does not require

289
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:20,216
specification of inverse models that

290
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:22,872
are widely used in other formulations of

291
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:23,930
motor control.

292
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,360
8.5 makes a slightly more sophisticated

293
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,140
model that's based around not just

294
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,856
position, because, of course, you can't

295
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,956
just pick up your finger and move it to

296
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:42,492
a different position. Really, the action

297
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:45,376
affordances are in the space of changes

298
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:47,664
in velocity, which is to say,

299
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,432
acceleration. So this is kind of a

300
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,704
classical mechanical perspective on

301
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:55,300
motor control, and it also points

302
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,636
towards generalized coordinates of

303
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:01,536
motion and that kind of PID

304
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:06,252
control and the Bayesian mechanics

305
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,610
and so on.

306
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,290
Okay, now we get to 8.3.

307
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,636
Continuous time formulations are well

308
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,780
suited to characterization of movements.

309
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,108
Well, certain kinds of movements on a

310
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:26,030
chessboard, maybe not,

311
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,924
but some kinds of movements, sure.

312
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:32,512
Eric? Yeah,

313
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:37,890
I like to point out with equation 8.5

314
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,832
just above that where he's got the

315
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:46,450
they've got this spring mass.

316
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,564
So that

317
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:55,488
system oscillates forever, right? It's

318
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:59,144
got a spring and a mass, and there's no

319
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,730
dissipation of energy.

320
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,370
So it's a step, I guess, better than

321
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,480
more advanced than equation

322
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,024
8.3, in which you have instantaneous

323
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:13,804
acceleration. So they recognize, okay,

324
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,632
you can have instantaneous acceleration,

325
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:19,724
but there's no damper here.

326
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:23,436
So normally the

327
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,660
true equilibrium point control

328
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,732
formulation is viewed as a spring mass

329
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,630
damper system. And,

330
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,708
um, that way, if you if you

331
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,028
remember from physics class, you know,

332
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:41,140
depending upon your setting, your your

333
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,924
mass, the spring tension and the amount

334
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:46,324
of damping you can get over damping or

335
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:47,828
under damping, and then you can get kind

336
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,370
of an optimal settling to the or

337
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,072
approach of the set point with maybe

338
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:56,152
just a little bit of overshoot or no

339
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:57,848
overshoot. But if you don't have a

340
00:18:57,854 --> 00:19:00,696
damper in there, then it never settles

341
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,510
in at the equilibrium point.

342
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,860
So just to carry this a bit further,

343
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,968
I would have to disagree with this

344
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:13,344
statement that continuous time

345
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,184
formulations are well suited to

346
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,930
characterization of movements, because

347
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,692
that's assuming that the equilibrium

348
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:22,144
point control model is a good

349
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:24,384
characterization of movement. I worked

350
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:26,116
on this in grad school for about two

351
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,572
years. When I first got to grad school,

352
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,412
we worked on the Ilium point

353
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:35,060
control model. I worked in the BT lab

354
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,180
at MIT. We had an apparatus that

355
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,896
mimicked an apparatus that was used in

356
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:44,264
monkeys. We had one that we used on

357
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:47,784
ourselves as human subjects, which would

358
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,876
allow you to move your arm, and then it

359
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,668
would kind of give you a little jolt, a

360
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:56,172
little disruption to measure the amount

361
00:19:56,226 --> 00:20:00,312
of stiffness in. Your movement

362
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:04,416
as you're moving your arm as

363
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,944
a way of trying to deconstruct or work

364
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:08,860
back the parameters of the equilibrium

365
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,416
point control model for

366
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:15,430
movement. And it's attractive because,

367
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,204
as they say in the chapter, well,

368
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:20,772
you don't have to have any very

369
00:20:20,826 --> 00:20:24,336
sophisticated knowledge of motor

370
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:27,684
planning or inverse model of

371
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:31,336
your plant. The system, in order to all

372
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:32,568
you do is you say, well, this is where I

373
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:35,240
want the arm to go. And passively,

374
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,148
it takes care of itself, perhaps through

375
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,128
a feedback loop, through the spinal

376
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:44,604
cord, which I guess is what, 8.1 has.

377
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:46,892
It's interesting that there's a paper

378
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:51,364
from 2000 and 911 and Feldman

379
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:55,312
that is reviewing this, but our

380
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,136
conclusion was pretty much that

381
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:00,668
equilibrium point control for motor

382
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:04,112
control, it really is not a good model.

383
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,764
It doesn't work. In order

384
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,316
to make it work, you have to have all

385
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,104
kinds of play, all kinds of shenanigans,

386
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:14,576
like, well, you not just have a fixed

387
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,376
set point, you might overshoot and then

388
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:18,104
you bring your set point back and you

389
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,876
actually have to control the stiffness

390
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,792
during movement in order to account for

391
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:26,228
observed data. But still it falls

392
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,900
short because many, if not

393
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,776
most human movements or any motor

394
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,736
movements are ballistic.

395
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:40,172
So it's not that you set

396
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:42,828
some conditions and then your spinal

397
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:46,256
cord and motors and muscles act

398
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:49,360
to fulfill those conditions that you set

399
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,756
once from the top, from your brain.

400
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:56,196
What really happens is your

401
00:21:56,298 --> 00:22:00,196
descending signals anticipate a

402
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,596
whole trajectory or a whole plan in

403
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:04,624
advance of how we're going to accelerate

404
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,764
and then we're going to have to

405
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:09,990
decelerate. And so

406
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,888
the motor planning kind of knows what

407
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:14,356
your plant is going to do. It doesn't

408
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:15,768
wait for the plant to do something and

409
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:17,976
then have to respond to that in kind of

410
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:21,160
a passive way at the lower levels.

411
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,416
So it's just like if you play the piano,

412
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:25,020
you're not waiting for your finger to

413
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,310
say, am I far enough down on the key?

414
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,476
You learn how hard you have to press it

415
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:33,200
and when you start to release before

416
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,640
anything happens. Our movements are very

417
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,496
fast. There's really no

418
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:42,956
getting around having to model a plant

419
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,216
and doing this sort of inverse modeling

420
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:48,708
that they're concerned about in

421
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:51,264
order to account for how any creature

422
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:54,228
really moves or anything above an

423
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:56,308
insect, and probably an insect too, is

424
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,820
undoubtedly it's a motor plant.

425
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,200
I really find that this chapter,

426
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,510
I don't think it advances a cause of

427
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,540
active inference.

428
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,256
It doesn't really fit with how motor

429
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,516
control really has to work and doesn't

430
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,728
add anything to the theory of it. I

431
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:25,216
mean, it's using an old theory that

432
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:29,520
doesn't work. Thanks for all those

433
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,720
points. That's my statement.

434
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,100
That's it. That's the tweet.

435
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,604
Well, one live stream other than

436
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:44,628
49, which has just been like, amazing

437
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,756
from the physics angle. We're preparing

438
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:50,472
also for 50, which is using it's also

439
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:53,850
by Feldman, Barrett and others.

440
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,636
And it's specifically on interoceptive

441
00:23:57,668 --> 00:24:00,076
reflexes. So less exploring like the

442
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,652
spinal reflex arc and more on the

443
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:05,660
vasopressive interception.

444
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,708
But using those kinds of still

445
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:10,700
classical,

446
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,604
very differential,

447
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:21,120
equation based equilibria

448
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,332
control and

449
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:28,704
showing that those types of formalisms

450
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:31,984
can recapitulate like allostatic

451
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:32,820
behavior,

452
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,616
it's always difficult to know. Like, is

453
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:41,656
that a very narrow and fragile range of

454
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:44,836
parameter space? Is this a descriptive

455
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:47,480
model that's making unique predictions?

456
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,470
Let's look at figure eight. One,

457
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,350
because it's speaking to the

458
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,870
generative model, generative process

459
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,280
distinction that was mentioned earlier,

460
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,496
and it was addressed in a question. How

461
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:09,164
is this representation of the reflux arc

462
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:10,864
similar or different to what was being

463
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:14,628
used in figure five or in chapter five?

464
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,116
So in chapter five, here was the

465
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:21,584
summary statistic or summary graphical

466
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:24,500
abstract. There was a lot more focus on

467
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,816
this kind of like policy selection and

468
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:32,010
so on. But we we did have

469
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,330
this kind of a reflex arc, y,

470
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,390
E and so on. Okay, so now

471
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:56,910
we're in 8.1 f

472
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,660
is the action selection component.

473
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,492
So here is that simple attractor being

474
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:10,352
shown where it just

475
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:13,010
X is going to be converging to V,

476
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,936
and this is the change in external

477
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:24,550
states.

478
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,456
So here we have Mu of X in

479
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:54,610
an equation. In the lower one,

480
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,356
is this one referring to this or is that

481
00:26:58,378 --> 00:26:59,780
kind of bleeding out from the bottom

482
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,216
panel? Because here's

483
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,350
U of X, and here's Mu of X.

484
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,536
Here it looks like Mu of X is a

485
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,600
prediction modulator on a differential.

486
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,244
So it's like if the observation is

487
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:26,564
where you want to be, then there

488
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:29,524
shouldn't be any action. But as the

489
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:32,148
observation diverges from where you want

490
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:35,788
to be, you have a precision modulated

491
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:36,840
action.

492
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,694
Is that active inference or

493
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,122
is that just a

494
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:52,130
notation,

495
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,180
a different notational representation of

496
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,786
classical equilibrium point motor

497
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:05,910
control theory?

498
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,306
Do those models integrate sensory

499
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:14,680
and action together?

500
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,780
I mean, in one sense they definitely do.

501
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,534
Nobody was ever generating reflex arc

502
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:26,390
models without some sensory feedback

503
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,458
variable. So that's an open

504
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,834
important question. Is this didactic

505
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:36,094
with respect to active inference now

506
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,302
just kind of saying, yeah, one special

507
00:28:38,356 --> 00:28:41,394
case of active inference is the

508
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:43,646
traditionally understood and limited

509
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:46,094
equilibrium point model of motor

510
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,634
control, or is

511
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:52,870
it like, this is our new way of doing

512
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,280
motor point control?

513
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:05,974
Okay, just kind of continuing

514
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:06,620
on.

515
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,904
All right. Precision, attention and

516
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:16,080
sensory attenuation.

517
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,784
So here's another curious note.

518
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:26,096
So earlier we discussed whether motor

519
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,736
control was or wasn't a natural setting

520
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,988
for continuous models. In the box

521
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:33,680
81, they write, we address this the

522
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,996
importance of precision in chapter

523
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:36,788
seven, but it's worth recapping its role

524
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:38,984
in continuous time systems. In many

525
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:42,024
ways, this concept of precision is more

526
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:45,164
naturally addressed in this setting as

527
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:47,020
the Pi variable appears a direct

528
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,420
consequence of LaPlace approximation.

529
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,496
Okay, but can't you do a LaPlace

530
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:56,416
approximation in discrete systems as

531
00:29:56,438 --> 00:30:00,124
well? LaPlace approximation is just mode

532
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,576
determination followed by the

533
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:06,016
parameterization of a parabola to

534
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:08,812
create like a gaussian or at least a

535
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:14,980
concave optimizable

536
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,256
and two parametered approximation

537
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:23,316
to an arbitrary distribution. I don't

538
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:26,628
exactly see or is it referring

539
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:29,224
to the LaPlace approximation is itself a

540
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:32,776
continuous function, but you could

541
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,556
apply a LaPlace approximation to a

542
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:36,590
categorical distribution as well.

543
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,644
So in what ways is precision more

544
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:46,872
naturally addressed in a continuous

545
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:47,550
model?

546
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,164
Is it that precision is a continuous

547
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:56,144
variable? Like precision isn't an

548
00:30:56,182 --> 00:31:01,120
integer valued variable

549
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,116
so we can just leave that

550
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:12,260
one. Okay, so we

551
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,676
went into 83 dynamical systems, kind of

552
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:17,544
looked at the spinal cord again, but it

553
00:31:17,582 --> 00:31:19,624
may or may not just be a sort of like

554
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:23,828
trivialized or didactic representation

555
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:28,472
of extremely traditional representations

556
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:32,092
of motor control. Then box

557
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:34,632
one, precision attenuation attention,

558
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,876
sensory attenuation all. Right, now we

559
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:39,980
get into the lockvoltera dynamics.

560
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,396
So what are some formal

561
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:46,464
and qualitative implications of the use

562
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:49,852
of lock of voltera dynamics and Lorenz

563
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:53,488
systems? So I think there's

564
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:56,244
a few interesting angles that us here

565
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:00,224
now but others just more broadly

566
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:03,348
may be interested in. So one is lock of

567
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,628
voltera ties in of course with ecology

568
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:10,184
and population ecologies. And so that

569
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:12,504
is also very interesting to consider in

570
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:15,592
terms of winnerless competitions and

571
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:18,308
neural dynamics. And that is basically

572
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:21,484
the analogy which is like just like even

573
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,772
if you have a negative edge between the

574
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:27,752
predator and the prey for any persistent

575
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:30,596
which is to say oscillatory or manifold

576
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,824
attracting population, at some

577
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:36,720
point you have to let the prey regrow.

578
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,108
So the analogy in neuroscience that's

579
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,428
fleshed out in SPM is like if you have a

580
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:45,440
brain region even with a unilaterally

581
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,740
negative influence on another region,

582
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,604
at some point it has to let off the

583
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:54,896
brake cyclically. So lock of volteris

584
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:56,724
summarizes these kinds of winnerless

585
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:59,064
dynamics that can give oscillation and

586
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,972
time structure including with complex

587
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:05,204
dynamics and recurrent dynamics, limit

588
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,332
attractors. All these kinds of dynamical

589
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:13,470
processes can arise from a pretty simple

590
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,116
starting point. And here

591
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:22,800
we see manifolds and

592
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,888
limits on the projection because it's a

593
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:27,116
three dimensional space plant,

594
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:29,856
herbivore carnivore or that could be the

595
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:33,404
blood oxygenation of three

596
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:36,724
brain regions in SPM and this is their

597
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:39,056
neural trace or their inferred

598
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:40,564
activities. And so then you can find

599
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,304
like manifolds of lower dimensional

600
00:33:42,352 --> 00:33:45,924
activity. And then also one kind

601
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:50,040
of related note is the Voltaire series

602
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,444
and this is a pretty nice just technical

603
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:57,684
note which is Taylor series does

604
00:33:57,822 --> 00:34:01,672
expansion of arbitrary

605
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:05,212
functions from a starting point and

606
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:09,096
the voltera series is able to include

607
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:12,512
like a window of inputs also known as

608
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:16,796
the memory effect. And so it's discussed

609
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,832
in SPM. It has a continuous time

610
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:24,692
and a discrete time variant and it

611
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:28,196
is just a kind of kernel estimator that

612
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,320
can be used for dynamical processes,

613
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,436
input output dynamical processes with

614
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:36,136
memory. So it's kind of

615
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,344
a classic in that area. And I think even

616
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:42,168
in some live stream, maybe 45,

617
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:45,476
I asked Friston about the Lockable Terra

618
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:49,356
models and about why do

619
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,836
we move away from them or something like

620
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:53,996
that. But that'd be a good answer to

621
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:59,340
kind of come back to. All right, so now

622
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,964
those kinds of lockable terror dynamics

623
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,680
are going to be applied,

624
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,476
monochromatically as ever, to active

625
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:11,568
inference. And that was one question,

626
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:14,096
which is it didn't finish writing. How

627
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:17,124
is the Lockable Terra model being used

628
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:19,460
in the case of handwriting?

629
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,368
So I think it's in the Friston and

630
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:32,276
Herrero's paper, which I just brought

631
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:33,812
in, but I didn't really investigate

632
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:34,680
deeply.

633
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,854
The left, there's two different

634
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,146
applications here. Left eye

635
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,750
blink, conditioning.

636
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,142
So here it looks like a condition

637
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:56,370
stimulus, unconditioned stimulus,

638
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,114
where there's like where

639
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,970
something happens and you blink.

640
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,988
As we've mentioned previously, it's a

641
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:11,300
little bit difficult to tell exactly

642
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,524
what these expectations are of or

643
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:17,190
anything like that, but this is like

644
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,820
some kind of stimulus response.

645
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,968
Blink once if no, twice if yes, once if

646
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,896
by land, twice if by sea. And then on

647
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:30,520
the right side, sequential peaks using

648
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,336
an attracting point, but selecting the

649
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,316
specific attractor on the basis of which

650
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:37,276
population a lockable terrace system is

651
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:39,356
currently highest. This leads to

652
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:40,860
sequential visiting of each points,

653
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,696
giving rise to a type of handwriting.

654
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:44,716
So this is kind of interesting, and I

655
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:47,312
know for Yaakob and Ali also, with our

656
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:50,924
mode tracking path matching discussion,

657
00:36:50,972 --> 00:36:54,850
Bayesian physics. So it's like

658
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,316
I I must it's

659
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:03,284
Bart Simpson at the chalkboard. This is

660
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:04,964
I must rewrite the sentence. I must

661
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:06,644
rewrite the sentence. I must. So your

662
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,908
expectations are that you're going to be

663
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:11,796
writing this sentence and then depending

664
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:15,432
on which of those expectations are on

665
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:20,152
top, that is going to set the

666
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,840
motor imperative.

667
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,936
So it'd be like if you were writing the

668
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,508
letter D. And it'd be like well, it's

669
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:30,044
like first there's like an arc down into

670
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,644
the right, and then there's an arc down

671
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,288
into the left, and then it's a straight

672
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:34,988
line up. And then it's an arc down to

673
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:36,176
the right, and then it's an arc down to

674
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:37,632
left, and then it's a straight line up.

675
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,240
And so here, it's kind of like doing

676
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,836
this writing as it's

677
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,880
picking a mode, pursuing the mode,

678
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,116
and I think it's fair to say,

679
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:53,236
Yakavarli, please add any more if you

680
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:57,110
feel like it. But like, this is like

681
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,204
shaking off the slumber of

682
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:03,732
the classical physics and still having

683
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:07,136
1ft in both worlds. And the three faces

684
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:10,884
of Bayesian mechanics are a much more

685
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:21,670
advanced way to discuss us. This issued

686
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,818
what do you think? I was just going to

687
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:35,802
say that this well,

688
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:37,974
not the case with writing specifically,

689
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:41,866
but the case of motor motor

690
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:45,834
control was discussed in Thomas

691
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:49,386
Parr's lecture at the CPC

692
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:51,486
2022, which I don't know if it was

693
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:54,500
recorded, actually, I think it was,

694
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,540
but I don't know if it's public yet.

695
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,274
But it's interesting that this

696
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:05,058
example is in the continuous time

697
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:08,246
chapter because you could think of

698
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,102
it as a nested generative model with

699
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:16,034
both discrete and continuous factors.

700
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:18,842
Like if you partition it into three

701
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:22,682
decisions, like first straight line up,

702
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,094
then an arc down, then a second arc

703
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:28,534
down. Those are three discrete decisions

704
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:32,366
that are at the top of the

705
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:36,400
hierarchical generative model with the

706
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,200
finer grain motor control below.

707
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,742
Thanks. Also just here's, that classic

708
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:52,174
three faces figure mode

709
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:55,826
tracking. This can be seen as using a

710
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:58,614
lock of Ultera pseudo random number

711
00:39:58,652 --> 00:40:01,782
generator to spit out higher

712
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:05,490
level predictions about which mode

713
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,774
should be pursued. Then as to the

714
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:12,330
dynamics of how that mode is approached,

715
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,740
one can either use the equilibrium point

716
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,314
methods discussed in this chapter or the

717
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,666
more advanced Bayesian physics methods

718
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,666
to describe that in terms of gauge

719
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:27,120
theory and so on. Is that fair to say?

720
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,998
This it Jakub. Thank you, Ali, for

721
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:45,726
sending it. It's not

722
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:47,266
the same. It's not the same one. But it

723
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:51,766
looks like a lot of the slides are the

724
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:53,974
same. I think the thing that I was

725
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:58,086
referring to I'm just trying to

726
00:40:58,108 --> 00:40:59,430
find the slide.

727
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,026
Oh, yeah. I think it might be minute 41.

728
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:06,940
Okay.

729
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,870
I really can't wait till there's some

730
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,840
open source webcam software to do

731
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,726
isocate analysis and pupil

732
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:35,060
diameter. I don't think it would be that

733
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,818
intractable. Maybe you'd have to be kind

734
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:40,326
of close, or you'd have to use a 4K

735
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:43,734
camera or something. But is there any

736
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:45,574
software like that available? I've never

737
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:49,720
come across it just like

738
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,058
move the mouse to where I'm looking and

739
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:55,930
then click when I blink twice.

740
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,366
Isn't that kind of like that does exist,

741
00:42:01,558 --> 00:42:03,466
but what is it called? Or where is it

742
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:04,300
being used?

743
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,320
I know it's being used for

744
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,582
people with physical impairments who

745
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:15,440
can't control the computer.

746
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,020
Yeah. Otherwise, yes.

747
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,014
I haven't seen an analysis

748
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:29,358
of pupil dilation, but eye tracking

749
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:32,386
is definitely a thing. Okay, maybe we

750
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:35,126
can explore it. All right, so, yeah,

751
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:37,430
the blinking example was a puff of air.

752
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,526
So it was just like a beep and then a

753
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:43,786
puff of air. And so then they

754
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:45,770
learned to preempt the air puff.

755
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,594
Okay. Learning incontinence models eight

756
00:42:51,632 --> 00:43:00,074
two continuous

757
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,046
time domain accumulating evidence. This

758
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:03,950
works if we treat data in a series of

759
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,370
small time intervals. Oh, no,

760
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,010
don't discretize.

761
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,660
This relates, I think, to some of the

762
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,062
finer points on which Stochastic

763
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:20,850
calculus is used, like the Edo calculus

764
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,950
in the Bayesian mechanics.

765
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,022
We won't go into it unless anybody

766
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:30,134
really wants to say more, but this looks

767
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:32,214
like important just to learn about the

768
00:43:32,252 --> 00:43:34,070
integrals and the gradients.

769
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,818
P OMDP has largely superseded the use of

770
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:42,250
the generalized Lotka volterra systems

771
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,130
in active inference applications.

772
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,834
That was kind of, I think, related to

773
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:49,626
asking Friston about why things moved

774
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:50,906
away from the lockable Terra

775
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:51,790
formulations.

776
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,682
Lorenz system, also explored in

777
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:01,710
Stochastic Chaos Markov blankets

778
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,300
Livestream 32.

779
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,062
It's it's almost. It's dealt with as

780
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,934
minimally as you could possibly deal

781
00:44:12,972 --> 00:44:15,894
with the Lorenz system in 87.

782
00:44:16,012 --> 00:44:19,750
Okay. 84 generalized synchrony.

783
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,374
So multi agent inference starts coming

784
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,674
into play as well as agent environment

785
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:26,018
synchronization. And we actually like,

786
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:27,718
talked a little bit about the birdsong

787
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:31,402
in the previous hour. Now the Run system

788
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:34,858
comes back and yes, it's dealt with like

789
00:44:34,944 --> 00:44:39,066
sort of in the 2015 Frith and Friston

790
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:41,786
paper, active inference communication

791
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:44,926
and hermeneutics. And that's where the

792
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,006
synchronization manifold is kind of

793
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:49,940
displayed. And then more recently in

794
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,580
live stream 32.

795
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,386
And this one has a dot three. I think

796
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:00,178
this might be the only dot three as of

797
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:03,746
this point. I think Connor

798
00:45:03,778 --> 00:45:06,070
Hines could only come at a later date.

799
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,630
Yeah, so these are good discussions

800
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,566
on Lorenz attractor a couple Lorenz

801
00:45:14,598 --> 00:45:15,450
systems.

802
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,258
This is kind of very similar, if not

803
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:25,158
identical to the birdsong

804
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:27,486
synchronization manifold in first and

805
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:30,666
fifth 2015. Birds, birds,

806
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:31,470
birds.

807
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,314
Bird synchronization isn't real then

808
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:41,410
hybrid discrete models,

809
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,946
hybrid mixed models, not that kind

810
00:45:48,968 --> 00:45:51,734
of mixed model allow inferences about

811
00:45:51,772 --> 00:45:53,602
sequential action plans and translations

812
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,154
of those decisions into movements

813
00:45:55,202 --> 00:45:56,840
through a continuous model.

814
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,630
So in that respect,

815
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,366
it's extremely linked to Livestream.

816
00:46:04,418 --> 00:46:06,314
46 active inference models do not

817
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:08,714
contradict folk psychology, which is all

818
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:11,366
about that continuous time motor,

819
00:46:11,398 --> 00:46:14,378
active inference, discrete state space

820
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:17,514
decision active inference, mai and dai

821
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,850
and using those motor and decision

822
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,710
active inference models,

823
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,086
while lower level model in the dashed

824
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:32,226
box is the same form as the other

825
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,090
models.

826
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,522
In other words, it's continuous because

827
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:43,574
we have V instead of Pi for

828
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:46,950
the causal factors and F instead

829
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,102
of B and G instead

830
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:54,380
of A and

831
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,380
ETA instead of G.

832
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:08,442
Is it some

833
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:10,518
mapping between well, in this case, I

834
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:11,806
think just looking at it a little more

835
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:16,270
narrowly, how outcomes

836
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,040
map to slower causes of the world.

837
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,922
So here this is a discrete model up top

838
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,826
with the G. Oh, yeah, that was one

839
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:31,060
erotic that we found. Free floating G.

840
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,162
Can't live with it, can't live without

841
00:47:34,216 --> 00:47:36,198
it, but it should be connected to the

842
00:47:36,204 --> 00:47:40,418
pi. Of course there's

843
00:47:40,434 --> 00:47:44,054
a discrete time model on top and then it

844
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:47,510
is kind of cascading its outcomes

845
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,946
down to

846
00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:55,170
these continuous time models.

847
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,818
So one could think about this like the

848
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:01,878
Lock of Ultera handwriting example kind

849
00:48:01,884 --> 00:48:03,798
of could it's not the exact structure of

850
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:07,080
this, but it's related. Okay,

851
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,726
this is something I know Jakub has

852
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:14,190
thought about how discrete

853
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,490
and continuous models interface

854
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,306
because we've talked about how the

855
00:48:21,328 --> 00:48:22,746
temperature could be continuous and the

856
00:48:22,768 --> 00:48:24,298
thermometer could be continuous, but

857
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:26,106
then the internal generative model could

858
00:48:26,128 --> 00:48:29,934
be like, is it hot or not? So the

859
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:34,030
question of how to move

860
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,662
from generative models within

861
00:48:37,716 --> 00:48:39,778
and between different parts of the

862
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,906
model, where are what kinds of

863
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:43,378
transitions between continuous and

864
00:48:43,384 --> 00:48:45,060
discrete state spaces possible?

865
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:53,030
Okay, here's a continuous isocate

866
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:57,960
ocular motor paradigm where the

867
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,810
continuous lines are still confusing,

868
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,310
but at least they are justified.

869
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,106
83 combining categorical and

870
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:14,778
continuous generative models. Outside of

871
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,186
active inference has primarily been

872
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,110
framed through the lens of clustering.

873
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,966
The aim is to assign data points into a

874
00:49:21,988 --> 00:49:23,310
discrete cluster.

875
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,926
I wasn't exactly sure about that. I

876
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:31,150
think clustering is one discretization

877
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,914
clustering and thresholding is one

878
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:34,386
discretization approach that's been

879
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:38,642
used. Also, just binning seems

880
00:49:38,696 --> 00:49:40,370
like a simpler method.

881
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,062
How do you take a continuous

882
00:49:44,126 --> 00:49:45,926
distribution of one through ten and make

883
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:48,774
it categorical? Just bin it one through

884
00:49:48,812 --> 00:49:50,726
ten. Or you could cluster and do

885
00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:52,454
thresholds. So then you could have

886
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:56,634
cluster one with 9.7 to 9.9 and then 9.7

887
00:49:56,672 --> 00:50:02,074
to 9.5 and

888
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:07,738
then 86. There's a big table here's.

889
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,902
The songbirds this

890
00:50:11,956 --> 00:50:14,062
author Isamura, I believe, is the one

891
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:18,014
who will join for

892
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:21,358
51 in November, and I think that'll

893
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:23,426
be like our last probably one of our

894
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:25,940
last paper streams for the year.

895
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,066
We have just this last discussion with

896
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:33,746
Dalton next week and then interception,

897
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:35,426
and then the canonical neural networks

898
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:38,326
perform active inference papers. But

899
00:50:38,348 --> 00:50:40,038
Isomer has worked with Par and Frisk and

900
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:42,546
others. Ocular, motor reflex, eye

901
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:45,174
pursuit, psychosis illusion, circade

902
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:47,574
action, observation, attention, hybrid,

903
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:50,010
and self organization models.

904
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,040
Well, with four minutes left,

905
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,030
kind of an interesting chapter,

906
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,072
but I can only know it how I'm seeing

907
00:51:12,146 --> 00:51:14,784
it, and I have serious questions about

908
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,210
what it does in the book.

909
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,880
Eric.

910
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,968
One thing I was puzzled by, maybe you

911
00:51:23,974 --> 00:51:26,784
guys can help me out with the bird song

912
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:31,024
example is, were they implying that bird

913
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:34,836
starts singing, another bird picks it

914
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,700
up synchronizes using these dynamics,

915
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,496
and the proof of that is that

916
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,016
some other bird will just step in and

917
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:45,416
take over and the first bird can stop.

918
00:51:45,598 --> 00:51:47,384
I don't believe I've ever heard that

919
00:51:47,422 --> 00:51:49,412
happening. Are they suggesting that that

920
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:51,070
happens or what?

921
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,550
Okay, I agree.

922
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,928
Whether this is a bird improv

923
00:52:02,104 --> 00:52:04,536
conversation, in this case, they're

924
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:07,584
singing from the same hymn sheets. So

925
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:10,048
it's like somebody should be singing the

926
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:12,896
bird anthem, and now we're going to be

927
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:15,940
engaging in this sort of quasi dialogue

928
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,844
where we're going to be reducing our

929
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:21,684
surprise about hearing the song that we

930
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,630
expect to hear, which goes like,

931
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,110
insert your favorite song there.

932
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,312
And then the phenomena that gets

933
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:37,352
highlighted is the way in which one

934
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:40,776
bird is singing, and then as it's

935
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:43,740
singing, its precision starts to drift

936
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,232
and then it stops singing,

937
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:50,108
and then the other bird finds itself

938
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:54,432
picking up at the same point to

939
00:52:54,486 --> 00:52:58,172
reduce its surprise about that song

940
00:52:58,236 --> 00:52:59,730
being sung at the time.

941
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,896
But I think especially with with a bold

942
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:07,344
title like, laying claim to hermeneutics

943
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,420
more broadly,

944
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,984
singing from the same pre coordinated

945
00:53:16,032 --> 00:53:19,640
hymn sheet is not

946
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,620
the same thing as information updating

947
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,360
or even just pure expressivity.

948
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,204
So I think it

949
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:37,724
leaves gaping areas for people to

950
00:53:37,762 --> 00:53:41,164
actually develop because it's like,

951
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:42,976
well, we have what don't we have?

952
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:44,796
Databases of like, millions of bird

953
00:53:44,828 --> 00:53:48,480
songs and natural soundscapes.

954
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,496
So, like, we need some bird watching,

955
00:53:52,598 --> 00:53:56,752
active inference practitioners who

956
00:53:56,806 --> 00:54:00,168
want to actually develop the bird song

957
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,436
motif because otherwise it is too easy

958
00:54:02,538 --> 00:54:04,468
and ironically become singing from the

959
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,624
same hymn sheet. Oh, well, Hermeneutics

960
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:08,170
has been addressed in 2015.

961
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,530
Synchronization manifold 2015.

962
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,760
Whereas this is like a very fringe case

963
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,940
of communication that is based upon

964
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,976
most charitably, high reliability

965
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:30,220
execution of preordained performance,

966
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,776
which is a tiny edge case of

967
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:34,720
communication.

968
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,436
My understanding of bird songs is baby

969
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:44,064
birds hear what their parents sing,

970
00:54:44,182 --> 00:54:46,724
they've got some predisposition to sing

971
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:49,956
a certain kind of song, and for

972
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:52,292
most birds, there are some that are very

973
00:54:52,346 --> 00:54:55,108
adaptable. Parents, parrots, stuff like

974
00:54:55,114 --> 00:54:58,840
that. But most birds learn the accent

975
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,256
or the dialect that they are raised in,

976
00:55:03,278 --> 00:55:04,552
and that's the song that they always

977
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:08,404
sing. And there's some variation

978
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:10,296
on it. I mean, maybe they'll stop midway

979
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:13,672
through. But what are the true facts

980
00:55:13,736 --> 00:55:17,180
about what I thought to be a claim here,

981
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,772
where birds will pick up from

982
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:24,604
each other or one leaves off? Does that

983
00:55:24,642 --> 00:55:27,136
really happen? I'm not familiar with

984
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,104
that happening. I don't think I've ever

985
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:31,296
heard it happening. My impression of the

986
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:33,264
way moosebirds sing is they'll sing

987
00:55:33,302 --> 00:55:35,636
their song all the way through and there

988
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:37,604
might be a call in response, another one

989
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:41,252
might pick up, might answer.

990
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:43,092
But I don't think I have error here,

991
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:46,100
synchronizing of songs, but I might be

992
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,856
just not well enough informed about the

993
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,544
ecology of those things. Yeah, very

994
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:55,290
interesting questions.

995
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,128
And the whole area with game theory

996
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,340
of song,

997
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,100
like, it's beneficial that somebody

998
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,684
warns about the predator, but then

999
00:56:08,722 --> 00:56:10,892
you've revealed your location when you

1000
00:56:10,946 --> 00:56:12,896
sing and things like that. That's the

1001
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:17,164
kind of decision making and uncertainty

1002
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:20,508
resolution and risk evaluation

1003
00:56:20,604 --> 00:56:23,788
that I'd imagine an agent based birdsong

1004
00:56:23,804 --> 00:56:26,756
model would orient towards.

1005
00:56:26,938 --> 00:56:29,108
But those are some cool ways for us to

1006
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:31,750
go. So next week,

1007
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,464
I guess this is kind of a shorter

1008
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:36,592
chapter and it has some arcane

1009
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:39,992
symbolism, but also seemingly very

1010
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:43,748
skippable symbolism. So I'm

1011
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:45,384
glad that we could get through the whole

1012
00:56:45,422 --> 00:56:49,332
thing and we'll return to

1013
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,756
any further thoughts on eight and

1014
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:57,228
then maybe we can have more of a seven

1015
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:59,260
plus eight synthesis.

1016
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,084
Or anyone can look into any of these

1017
00:57:03,122 --> 00:57:06,396
citations key advances as we

1018
00:57:06,498 --> 00:57:10,604
head into, like, chapter nine on

1019
00:57:10,642 --> 00:57:11,870
empirical data,

1020
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,230
which is not super long,

1021
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,316
followed by ten, which is just a

1022
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:26,704
restatement. So onwards

1023
00:57:26,752 --> 00:57:29,620
we go. Thanks, y'all. Bye.

1024
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,492
Thanks,
