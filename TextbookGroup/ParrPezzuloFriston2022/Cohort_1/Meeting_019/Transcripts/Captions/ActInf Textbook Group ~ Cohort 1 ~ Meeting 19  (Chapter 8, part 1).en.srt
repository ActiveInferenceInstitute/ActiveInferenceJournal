1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,580
hello everyone

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,060
it's October 7th 2022

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,179
we are in meeting 19 for cohort one

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,440
and we're discussing chapter eight

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
so

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,300
there's a bunch of questions

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,600
and also a lot of things to talk about

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,420
let us just begin with looking at

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,160
chapter eight

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,420
so

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,199
does anybody want to uh

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,600
give any first thoughts

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,420
on active inference and continuous time

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,540
everything flows nothing stands still

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,719
Etc

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,879
yes

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,079
um

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,760
I not on that specifically okay but I

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,899
will have something to say about this

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,840
chapter I I worked on this topic

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,079
um during my my graduate time so what

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,400
should we get to about 8.3 I'll weigh in

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,380
excellent

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,220
um

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,320
any

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,860
comments like discrete continuous time I

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,479
know this is something we'll touch on

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,140
again and again

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,400
it's kind of like another low road High

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Road

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,939
duality

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,220
with continuous Indiscreet time and I

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,040
think the textbook tries to give

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,220
equal time

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,040
and highlight the hybridization of these

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,240
models

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,360
in a way where realistically in the

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,460
literature most

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,000
are pure discrete models

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,180
and continuous time models

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,420
um have been almost like domain bound

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,180
certain areas like motor reflexes where

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,560
there's more of a tradition of

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,258
continuous models

45
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,440
are heavily

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,360
represented in them whereas decision

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,920
making models

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,340
tend to use the discrete formalisms and

49
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,739
that difference between the sort of like

50
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,480
continuous time traditionally motor

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,080
Associated and discrete categorical

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,900
traditionally decision oriented

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,560
models was addressed in the

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,140
um folk psychology

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,800
paper and live stream with Ryan Smith at

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
all

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,560
okay

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,239
um also I

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,700
just started kind of an overview got up

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,620
through eight three

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,120
of

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,700
just understanding and just trying to

63
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,000
lay out chapter eight so for any chapter

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,580
everyone's always welcome

65
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,519
[Music]

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,840
to just

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,260
make summaries and and add their own

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,040
notes

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,459
so we can look at the

70
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,220
questions

71
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,440
many of which are on the earlier part of

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,200
the chapter and so maybe we can look at

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,980
the

74
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,080
earlier part of the chapter more this

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,379
week and of course then have later time

76
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,720
uh

77
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,599
okay so 8.1

78
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,760
it's a single

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,739
paragraph

80
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,599
it's a complement to chapter seven which

81
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,760
was a discrete time approach towards

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,799
generative model construction

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
the focus here is on continuous State

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,480
space models which are well suited for

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,299
physical fluctuations sensor receptors

86
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,640
and continuous motion of effectors

87
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,580
they start with the case of movement

88
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,159
control 8.2

89
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,420
so

90
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,560
let's get familiar with the notation

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,019
the states

92
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,019
hidden states are going to be X

93
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,720
the data the observables are going to be

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,159
y

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,500
and then how States evolve over time

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,918
depends on a static variable V so that

97
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,199
could be a hidden or slower changing

98
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,620
cause or factor in the environment

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,199
then we have the Omega terms associated

100
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,259
with each of the data and the hidden

101
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,060
States change Through Time

102
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,520
and that variability

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
um is like the noise and this is like

104
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,540
the signal or the flow so it's kind of

105
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,699
the lengthen decomposition or language

106
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,400
approach towards

107
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,639
dynamical systems modeling

108
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,840
um

109
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,600
one interesting thing to note is first

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,620
that this is hugely foresaged in

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,960
um SPM

112
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,460
then

113
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,820
um also that the data

114
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,000
are a function of the states at that

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,380
time

116
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,960
whereas the equation for the hidden

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,740
States is a change in Hidden States

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,520
x dot

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,100
note that action is absent from equation

120
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
8.1

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,080
this is because action is part of the

122
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,000
generative process not the generative

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,300
model

124
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,740
thought that was kind of an interesting

125
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,460
um

126
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,380
question

127
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,840
what does that mean that action is part

128
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,460
of the generative process and not the

129
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,039
generative model

130
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,800
surely action selection is part of the

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
generative

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,479
model

133
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,580
the cognitive process of policy

134
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,060
inference

135
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,580
active States

136
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,539
are part of the particular States

137
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,340
active states are blanket States

138
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,440
particular states are the generative

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,740
model

140
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,820
the generative process is referring

141
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,340
to the external States the hidden States

142
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,720
so is action part of both the generative

143
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,419
process and the generative model

144
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,919
because it kind of sits in between

145
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,919
intermediates

146
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,199
or is this referring

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,759
to the consequences

148
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,100
the generative model only deals with

149
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
those variables directly influenced by

150
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,120
States external to a Markov blanket

151
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,319
so is that saying that the generative

152
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,840
model is kind of like the complement

153
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,360
of the autonomous States action internal

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,740
States

155
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,199
or is this even more extreme

156
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,940
it's only dealing with the variables

157
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,039
directly influenced by States external

158
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,740
to a markup blanket so then it must only

159
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,360
deal with sense States

160
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,220
which is like a narrow perceptual

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,639
control reading

162
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,419
and in that situ in that sense

163
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,660
action execution

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,880
is outside of the generative model

165
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,340
because the generative model is only

166
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,900
dealing with observations

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
does anyone have thoughts on how

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
generative model action and generative

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,319
process are being used Eric

170
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,660
I wonder if you can consider your own

171
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,199
actions part of what gets observed

172
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
under that framework

173
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,240
as far as I would uh the Apologetics for

174
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,039
the narrow View

175
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,740
would be exactly that

176
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,780
which is like you have

177
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,840
um uh proprioceptors in your elbow

178
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,259
so you don't observe action but you are

179
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,360
getting continuous updating of

180
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,240
perceptions that are extremely

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,340
influenced by action

182
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,379
but the hidden state of the world is

183
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,139
actually like the angle of your elbow

184
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,319
and so you're not directly observing

185
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,599
the hidden state of the world nor how it

186
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,220
changes all you have is the

187
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,620
proprioceptors and of course you engage

188
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,679
in policies to change

189
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,659
your proprioceptors bring them towards

190
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,740
alignment which is what we're going to

191
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,440
be discussing in the chapter

192
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,060
Ali I saw your hand race

193
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,860
uh yeah I wanted to mention exactly the

194
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,360
proprioception which you mentioned so I

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,940
lowered my hand

196
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,380
okay yeah great

197
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,300
but then um could you include your you

198
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,519
know the fact that you've got

199
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,620
signals going to your muscles your your

200
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,080
motor signals and motor neurons are in

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
there making your muscles contract can

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,040
that be part of your observation

203
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,899
to say well okay if this is happening

204
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,640
that these muscles are getting activated

205
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,200
then

206
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,180
sure enough the the arm moves an

207
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,279
appropriate perception changes so you

208
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,720
can say well from

209
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
from the outside of that box

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,480
that's all part of the generative

211
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,399
model

212
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,560
of what

213
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,260
of seeing you know but not part of

214
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,360
generating the those muscle commands

215
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,740
which is seeing what the effect of them

216
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,519
is

217
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,440
I wonder if that would be an acceptable

218
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,860
viewpoint

219
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,060
cool well we just we'll return to this

220
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,360
like where is action what is action

221
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,920
but I think it's just important to note

222
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,540
while we're early here

223
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,620
okay

224
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,760
so

225
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
continuing a little bit on

226
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,140
this part I thought was also a little

227
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,880
curious

228
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,640
impact so this is equation 8.1 we

229
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,000
mentioned equation A2 so first question

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,459
italics versus bold G and F

231
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,600
do you think that that matters

232
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,140
I don't think it matters

233
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,620
does anyone disagree

234
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,420
like do you think it's moving from like

235
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,160
a some sort from one space to another

236
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,779
space or do you think that's just the

237
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,279
typographical

238
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,939
error

239
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,320
I think it can be considered as an

240
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,800
errata

241
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,320
um one thing I did notice is that 8.3

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,140
and 8.4 the italics they call a

243
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,779
generative model an 8.4 they call a

244
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,300
generative process with without the

245
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,000
italics could that be the distinction

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,760
oh um okay eight eight point three and

247
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,720
four

248
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,920
yeah ah okay

249
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
it's a very good question well let's

250
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,359
just say italics an 8.1 and 3.

251
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
old in

252
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
8.2 and 8.4

253
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,380
um unclear if relevance difference

254
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,300
okay

255
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,839
foreign

256
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,120
question I mean if the meta model you

257
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,140
say frames it so if you consider the

258
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,120
niche to be a meta model then sure

259
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
the difference between equation one and

260
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,880
two other than the Bolding or not

261
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,180
is that V

262
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,180
the static variables have been replaced

263
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,940
with u actions

264
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,279
so this takes us from like the sort of

265
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,440
SPM

266
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,459
where you'd be like you have

267
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,320
neuroimaging data y

268
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
as a function of underlying neural

269
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,360
States X and then neural States changing

270
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,519
through time are a function of neural

271
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,540
States at that time and some conditional

272
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,980
Factor

273
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,680
that you're testing for like whether

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,940
they were exposed to treatment water

275
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,339
treatment two V

276
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,240
so this is still a um

277
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,260
partially observable dynamical model

278
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,200
but then it gets moved very neatly into

279
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,959
the control theoretic and it

280
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,079
policy selection is inference Space by

281
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,300
just saying yeah those slowly changing

282
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,980
factors that influence how the hidden

283
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,240
States change

284
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,279
we control those

285
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,740
or we have some ability to influence

286
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,899
there

287
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,380
okay

288
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,779
yeah so this could be a cue towards the

289
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,220
Bold difference which is like the

290
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,100
functions G and F

291
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,720
are not necessarily the same as those

292
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,760
used to define the generative process if

293
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
they said not necessarily the same as

294
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,940
those used to define the general process

295
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,480
bold G and F then it would be

296
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
unambiguous

297
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,839
but it's a little ambiguous

298
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,500
we do not need to explicitly write down

299
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,779
the Dynamics of action in the generative

300
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,200
model

301
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,000
okay

302
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,200
they emerge from a choices made for

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,700
terms in equation 8.1

304
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,579
we start with a simple sort of

305
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,560
generative model

306
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
so G which is the function that's

307
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,800
generating the data is going to be

308
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,339
X

309
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,939
f

310
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,740
the function of how X changes Through

311
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,660
Time

312
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,660
is a function of X and V the slower

313
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,399
change in causes

314
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,500
and it's the difference between those

315
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,740
two

316
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
the hidden State represents the expected

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,620
value for the data

318
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,300
or in other way say that would be

319
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,399
equation three says that the expected

320
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,459
value for the data are the hidden state

321
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,199
but does the same

322
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,380
and it's a point attractor

323
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,880
or in the Bayesian mechanics we could

324
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,399
say it's mode

325
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,680
matching

326
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,720
by a tractor

327
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,100
um

328
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,940
uh yeah

329
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,620
yes the attractor here is the mode

330
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,300
tracking

331
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,060
that is being referred to here

332
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,440
when there's a difference between the

333
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,959
hidden State and the hidden cos V

334
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,240
then

335
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,639
it moves towards it so it's just moving

336
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,600
towards a single fixed Point attractor

337
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,500
now the generative process is defined

338
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,220
so it looks almost identical

339
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,459
except these are replaced with u's

340
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,540
and this differential tracker

341
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,019
this kind of PID control Motif is

342
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,240
replaced with

343
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,519
action

344
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,320
it's an expression of the equilibrium

345
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,660
point hypothesis

346
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,940
which treats motor control as enacted by

347
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,980
reflex arcs that draw limbs towards

348
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,139
equilibrium points set by descending

349
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,980
motor signals

350
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,100
in uh and then also this is related to

351
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,019
the skilled performance

352
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,240
live stream 23.

353
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,320
the scheme does not require

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,980
specification of inverse models

355
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,600
that are widely used in other

356
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,519
formulations of motor control

357
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,320
8.5

358
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,300
makes a slightly more sophisticated

359
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,980
model

360
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,639
that's based around not just position

361
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,440
because of course you can't just like

362
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,300
pick up your finger and move it to a

363
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,860
different position

364
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,160
really the action affordances are in the

365
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,579
space of changes in velocity which is to

366
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,320
say acceleration

367
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,820
so this is kind of a classical

368
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,540
mechanical perspective on motor control

369
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,459
and it also points towards uh

370
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,339
generalized coordinates of motion

371
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,980
and that kind of PID control

372
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,000
and the Bayesian mechanics and so on

373
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,859
okay

374
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,899
now we get to 8.3

375
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,720
continuous time formulations are well

376
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,500
suited to characterization of movements

377
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,240
well certain kinds of movements on the

378
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,459
chess board maybe not

379
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,340
but some kinds of movements sure Eric

380
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,140
yeah I like to point out with um

381
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,360
equation

382
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,320
8.5

383
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,820
um just above that

384
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,179
where he's got the they've got this

385
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,160
um spring Mass

386
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,480
so

387
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
um

388
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,960
that um that system oscillates forever

389
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,660
right it's got a spring and a mass

390
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,919
and there's no dissipation of energy

391
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,620
so it's it's a step up I guess better

392
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,820
than

393
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,940
um in a more advanced than

394
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,520
um equation 8.3 in which you have

395
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
instantaneous acceleration so they

396
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
recognize okay you can't have

397
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,460
instantaneous acceleration but there's

398
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,380
no there's no uh damper here so normally

399
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,320
the the the the true equilibrium point

400
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,440
control formulation is is viewed as a

401
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,480
spring Mass damper system

402
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
and

403
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,160
um

404
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,320
that way if you if you remember from

405
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,900
physics class you know depending upon

406
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,780
your set your your mass the spring

407
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,179
tension and the amount of damping you

408
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,039
can get over damping or under damping

409
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,720
and then you can get kind of an optimal

410
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,679
settling to the uh or uh approach of the

411
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,720
set point with maybe just a little bit

412
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,660
of overshoot or no overshoot but if you

413
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,160
don't have a damper in there then you it

414
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
just never it never cut cells in your at

415
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,080
the equilibrium point

416
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,980
but um

417
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,460
so just to carry this a bit further um

418
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,620
I I have to would have to to disagree

419
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,320
with this statement that continuous time

420
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,120
formulations are well suited to

421
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
characterization of movements because

422
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,020
that's that's assuming that a the

423
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,539
equilibrium point control model is a

424
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,880
good characterization of movement

425
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,740
I worked on this in grad school for

426
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,360
about two years when I first got to grad

427
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,740
school we worked on

428
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,460
um

429
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,700
the equilibrium point control

430
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,360
model in I work in the BT Lab at MIT

431
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,840
and we we had an apparatus

432
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,700
um that mimicked the apparatus that was

433
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,980
used in monkeys we had one that we used

434
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,400
on ourselves as human subjects which

435
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,919
would um allow you to move your arm

436
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,020
and then it would kind of give you a

437
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,760
little jolt a little a little disruption

438
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,740
to measure the amount of stiffness and

439
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,980
in your movement as you're moving your

440
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,260
arm

441
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,660
as a way of trying to deconstruct or or

442
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,460
work back the parameters of the

443
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,980
equilibrium point control

444
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,280
uh model for for movement and it's

445
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,020
attractive because

446
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,080
um as they say in this in the chapter

447
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,940
um well you don't have to have any very

448
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,559
sophisticated

449
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,500
um knowledge of motor planning

450
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,320
or inverse model of the of your your

451
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,179
plant the system

452
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,160
in order to all you do is you say well

453
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,320
this is where I want the arm to go and

454
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,900
passively uh it takes care of itself

455
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,400
perhaps through

456
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,620
um a feedback loop in the you know

457
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,120
through the spinal cord which I guess is

458
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,000
what 8.1 has

459
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,799
um it's interesting that that there's a

460
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,080
paper from 2009 uh 11 and Feldman that

461
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,500
is you know reviewing this but um our

462
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,240
conclusion was pretty much that

463
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,520
equilibrium point control

464
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,160
for motor motor control is just it

465
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,559
really is is not a good model it doesn't

466
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,000
work

467
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,260
um

468
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,299
in order to make it work you had to have

469
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,559
all kinds of play all kinds of

470
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,620
shenanigans like well you're not just

471
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,360
have a fixed set point you might

472
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,100
overshoot and then you bring your set

473
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,780
point back and you actually have to

474
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,720
control the stiffness during movement in

475
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,520
order to account for you know observed

476
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,299
data but still it falls short because it

477
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,140
because many if not most human movements

478
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,679
or any you know motor movements um are

479
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,880
ballistic

480
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,260
so it's not that you

481
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,539
set some conditions and then your your

482
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,860
spinal cord and motor and muscles act to

483
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,380
fulfill those conditions that you sat

484
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,960
once from the top from your brain

485
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,539
what really happens is

486
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,480
you're you're descending signals

487
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,580
anticipate

488
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,760
a whole trajectory or a whole plan in

489
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,620
advance of how we're going to accelerate

490
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,880
and then we're going to have to

491
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,740
decelerate

492
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,760
um

493
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,179
and so it's it's the motor planning kind

494
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,740
of knows what what your plant is going

495
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,360
to do it doesn't wait for the plant to

496
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,460
do something and then have to respond to

497
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,159
that in kind of a passive way at the

498
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,720
lower levels

499
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,860
um so it's just like you know if you

500
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,179
play the piano you're not waiting for

501
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,520
your finger to say am I far enough down

502
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,539
on the key

503
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,880
you you kind of you learn how hard you

504
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,440
have to press in and when you when you

505
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,600
start to the release before anything

506
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,419
happens I mean it's our movements are

507
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,620
very very fast

508
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,799
and and um so there's really no getting

509
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,320
around having to model the plant and

510
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,640
doing doing this sort of inverse

511
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
modeling that they're they're concerned

512
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
about

513
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,220
um in in order to account for how how

514
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,280
any creature really moves or anything

515
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
you know above an insect and probably an

516
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,760
insect who's

517
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,720
um undoubtedly of it's a motor plan so

518
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
um so I really find that this this

519
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,679
chapter

520
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:05,700
um is

521
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,100
is is really not

522
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,840
um I don't think it advances the cause

523
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,220
of

524
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,220
um active inference it doesn't really to

525
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,140
me um

526
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,700
it doesn't really fit with with with

527
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,460
with with how about a control really has

528
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,039
to work and doesn't add anything to to

529
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
the theory of it I mean it's using an

530
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,620
old theory that doesn't work

531
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,500
thanks for all those points

532
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
that's my statement

533
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,559
that's it that's the tweet

534
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,400
um well one uh live stream that other

535
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,159
than 49 which has just been like

536
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,440
amazing from the physics angle we're

537
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,799
preparing also for 50. which is using

538
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,600
it's also by

539
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,260
um

540
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,720
felden Barrett and others

541
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,720
and it's specifically on interceptive

542
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,240
reflexes so less exploring like the

543
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,760
spinal reflex arc and more on the

544
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,240
vasopressive interception

545
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,100
but using

546
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,320
those kinds of still classical

547
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,120
very

548
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,780
um

549
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,059
differential equation based

550
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:24,059
equilibria control

551
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,960
and showing that those types of

552
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,900
formalisms can

553
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,580
recapitulate like allostatic Behavior

554
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,640
it's always difficult to know like is

555
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,700
that a very narrow and fragile range of

556
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,440
parameter space

557
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
is this a descriptive model that's

558
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,080
making unique predictions

559
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,140
let's let's look at figure eight one

560
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,440
because it's speaking to um

561
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,900
the

562
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,480
generative model generative process

563
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
distinction that was mentioned earlier

564
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,179
and it was addressed in a question

565
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,700
how is this representation of the reflex

566
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,679
arc similar or different to what was

567
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,260
being used in figure five

568
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,340
or in chapter five so in chapter five

569
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,400
here was the summary statistic

570
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,100
or summary graphical abstract there was

571
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,279
a lot more focus on this kind of like

572
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,539
um policy selection and so on but we we

573
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,580
um did have

574
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,460
this kind of a reflex arc

575
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,960
why

576
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,279
e

577
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,559
and so on okay

578
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,940
so now

579
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,200
we're in 8.1

580
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,480
f

581
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,539
is the action selection

582
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,260
component

583
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
so here is that simple attractor being

584
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,980
shown

585
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,720
where

586
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,480
it's just X is going to be converging to

587
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,659
V

588
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,880
and this is the change in

589
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,299
external States

590
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,939
so here we have mu of x

591
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,100
in an equation

592
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,159
in the lower one

593
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,440
is this one referring to this or is that

594
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,880
kind of bleeding out from the bottom

595
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,240
panel

596
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,260
because here's U of X and here's you

597
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,980
have mu of x

598
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,480
here it looks like mu of X is a

599
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,059
prediction modulator

600
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,440
on a differential

601
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,600
so it's like if the observation is where

602
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,179
you want to be then there shouldn't be

603
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,679
any action

604
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,740
but as the observation diverges from

605
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,299
where you want to be

606
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,340
you have a Precision modulated action

607
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,340
is that active inference

608
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,340
or is that just

609
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,020
a notation

610
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,340
um a different notational representation

611
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,120
of

612
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,740
classical equilibrium point motor

613
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,580
control theory

614
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,340
do those models integrate

615
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,919
sensory and action

616
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,260
together

617
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,980
I mean in one sense they definitely do

618
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,620
nobody was ever generating reflex arc

619
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,020
models without some

620
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,059
sensory feedback variable

621
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,860
so that's open important question how is

622
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,919
this is this didactic with respect to

623
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,200
active inference now just kind of saying

624
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,059
yeah one special case of active

625
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,980
inference is

626
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,140
um the traditionally understood and

627
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,080
limited equilibrium point model of motor

628
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,379
control

629
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,740
or is it like this is our new way of

630
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,059
doing Motor Point control

631
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,500
okay just kind of

632
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,240
continuing on

633
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,100
all right Precision attention and

634
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,580
sensory attenuation

635
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,580
so here's another

636
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,539
um

637
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,299
curious note so earlier we we uh

638
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,179
discussed whether motor control was or

639
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,820
wasn't a natural setting for continuous

640
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,140
models

641
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,179
in the Box it won they write we

642
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,320
addressed this the importance of

643
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,880
precision in chapter seven but it's

644
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,440
worth recapping its role in continuous

645
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,140
time systems in many ways this concept

646
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,399
of precision

647
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,320
is more naturally addressed in this

648
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,760
setting

649
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,860
as the pi variable appears a direct

650
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,460
consequence of Laplace approximation

651
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,200
okay

652
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,380
but can't you do a LaPlace approximation

653
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,480
in discrete systems as well

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,059
LaPlace approximation is just mode

655
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,760
determination followed by the

656
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,520
parameterization of a parabola

657
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,000
to create like a gaussian or at least a

658
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,520
con cave

659
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,559
uh

660
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,260
optimizable

661
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,000
and

662
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,940
two parameter approximation to an

663
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,860
arbitrary distribution

664
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,740
I don't exactly see

665
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,419
or is it referring to the LaPlace

666
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,760
approximation is itself a continuous

667
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,159
function

668
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,539
but you could apply a LaPlace

669
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,100
approximation to a categorical

670
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,178
distribution as well

671
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,860
so in what ways is precision more

672
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,779
naturally addressed

673
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,220
in a continuous model

674
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,220
is it that Precision is a continuous

675
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,539
variable

676
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,240
like Precision isn't an integer valued

677
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,720
variable

678
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,080
so

679
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,279
we can just leave that one

680
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,260
okay but so we went into eight three

681
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,240
dynamical systems kind of looked at the

682
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,860
spinal cord again

683
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,500
but it may or may not just be a sort of

684
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,700
like trivialized or didactic

685
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,480
representation of extremely traditional

686
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,380
representations of motor control

687
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,679
then box one Precision attenuation

688
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,419
attention sensory attenuation all right

689
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:38,880
now we get into the lot kevaltera

690
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,980
Dynamics

691
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,380
so

692
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,299
what are some formal and qualitative

693
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,220
implications of the use of Latka

694
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,520
Volterra Dynamics and Lorenz systems

695
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,360
so I think there's a few interesting

696
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,659
angles that that us here now but others

697
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,520
just more

698
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,039
um broadly may be interested in

699
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,100
so one is lockabletera ties in of course

700
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,720
with ecology

701
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,299
and population ecologies

702
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:12,000
and so that is also very interesting to

703
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,159
consider in terms of like winnerless

704
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,820
competitions and neurodynamics and that

705
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,520
is basically the analogy which is like

706
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,440
just like even if you have a Negative

707
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,279
Edge between the predator and the prey

708
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,679
for any persistent which is to say

709
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,320
oscillatory or manifold attracting

710
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,179
population

711
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,580
at some point like you have to let the

712
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,500
prey regrow

713
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,080
so the analogy in Neuroscience that's

714
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,440
fleshed out in SPM is like if you have a

715
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
brain region even with a unilaterally

716
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,260
negative influence on another region

717
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,659
at some point it has to like let off the

718
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,640
break cyclically

719
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,100
so lockabletera summarizes these kinds

720
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,960
of like winnerless dynamics that can

721
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,140
give oscillation and time structure

722
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,179
including with like complex Dynamics and

723
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,179
recurrent Dynamics limit attractors all

724
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,520
these like kinds of dynamical processes

725
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,659
can arise from a pretty

726
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,820
simple

727
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,919
starting point

728
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,600
and uh here we see

729
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,080
manifolds and like limits on the

730
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,860
projection because it's a

731
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,600
three-dimensional space plant herbivore

732
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,539
carnivore or that could be the um blood

733
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,340
oxygenation

734
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,480
of three brain regions in SPM and this

735
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,120
is their neural trace or their inferred

736
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,740
activities and so then you can find like

737
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,559
manifolds of lower dimensional activity

738
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,919
and then also one um kind of related

739
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:47,700
note

740
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,760
is the Volterra series

741
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,279
and this is a pretty nice just technical

742
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,820
note which is Taylor series

743
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,519
does expansion

744
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,840
of

745
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,659
arbitrary functions from a starting

746
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:04,860
point

747
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,280
and the Volterra series is able to

748
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,119
include like a window of inputs also

749
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,820
known as the memory effect

750
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,719
and so it's discussed in

751
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,300
um SPM it has a continuous time and a

752
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,760
discrete time variant

753
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,219
and it is just a kind of Kernel

754
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,899
estimator

755
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,239
that can be used for dynamical processes

756
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,460
input output dynamical processes with

757
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,879
memory

758
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,139
so it's kind of a classic in that area

759
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,619
and I think even in some live stream

760
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,699
maybe 45 I asked Tristan about the

761
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,980
lockable terror models and about like

762
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,239
why

763
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,239
like where did we move away from them or

764
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,580
something like that but that'd be a good

765
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,580
answer to kind of come back to

766
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,440
all right so

767
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,320
um now those kinds of lockable Terror

768
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,500
Dynamics are going to be applied

769
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,660
um

770
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,680
monochromatically as ever

771
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,960
to active inference

772
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
and that was one question which is uh it

773
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,400
didn't finish writing how is the

774
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,180
lockableterra model being used in the

775
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,259
case of handwriting

776
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,859
foreign

777
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,380
and herrera's paper

778
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,940
which I just brought in but I didn't

779
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,060
really investigate deeply

780
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,180
um

781
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,960
the left

782
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,300
there's two different applications here

783
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,740
left

784
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,419
eye blink conditioning

785
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,300
so here it looks like a conditioned

786
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,560
stimulus unconditioned stimulus

787
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,260
where there's like

788
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,660
where something happens and you blink

789
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,900
as we've mentioned previously like it's

790
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,400
a little bit difficult to tell exactly

791
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,560
what these expectations are of or

792
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,880
anything like that

793
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,839
but

794
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,359
this is like

795
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,300
some kind of stimulus response

796
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,900
blink blink once if no Twice of yes once

797
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,359
if I land twice if I see

798
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,099
and then on the right side

799
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,380
sequential Peaks using an attracting

800
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,280
point

801
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,619
but selecting the specific attractor on

802
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,119
the basis of which population a

803
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,579
lockabletera system is currently highest

804
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,320
this leads to sequential visiting of

805
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,880
each points giving rise to a type of

806
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,680
handwriting so this is kind of

807
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,960
interesting and I I know for Jacob and

808
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,320
Ali also with our mode tracking path

809
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,160
matching discussion Bayesian physics

810
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,280
um so it's like

811
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,640
um I um I must

812
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,820
it's Bart Simpson at the chalkboard

813
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,859
this is I must rewrite the sentence I

814
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,720
must rewrite the sentence I must so your

815
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,920
expectations are that you're going to be

816
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,420
writing this sentence

817
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,220
and then

818
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,280
depending on which of those expectations

819
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,740
are on top

820
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,619
that is going to set

821
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,780
the motor

822
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,400
imperative

823
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,960
so it'd be like if you were writing the

824
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,740
letter

825
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,660
um D and it'd be like well it's like

826
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,180
first there's like an arc down and to

827
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,680
the right and then there's an arc down

828
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,300
to the left and then it's a straight

829
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,099
line up and then it's an arc down to the

830
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,300
right and then it's an arc down to the

831
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,800
left and then it's a straight line up

832
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,859
and so here's kind of like doing this

833
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,540
writing

834
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,980
as it's

835
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,300
picking a mode pursuing the mode

836
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,940
and I think it's fair to say uh jakov

837
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,320
early please

838
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,820
add any more if you feel like it but

839
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,900
like

840
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,780
this is like

841
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,839
shaking off the slumber

842
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,420
of the classical physics and still

843
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,820
having one foot in both worlds

844
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,800
and the three faces of Bayesian

845
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,839
mechanics

846
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,240
are a much more advanced way to discuss

847
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,839
this issue

848
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,079
yeah Jacob what do you think

849
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,000
I was just going to say that

850
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,619
um

851
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:35,160
this

852
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,500
well not the case with writing

853
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,480
specifically but uh

854
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,040
the case of motor uh motor control

855
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,180
was discussed in Thomas parr's lecture

856
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,240
um at the CPC 2022 which I don't know if

857
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,880
it was recorded uh actually I think it

858
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,839
was

859
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,079
uh but I don't know if it's public yet

860
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,400
um but it's interesting that this

861
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,980
example is in the continuous Time

862
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,579
chapter because you could think of it as

863
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,500
a nested generative model with both

864
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,760
discrete and continuous uh

865
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,240
uh factors like if you partition it into

866
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,420
three decisions like uh

867
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,119
for a straight line up then an arc down

868
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,460
then a second Arc down

869
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,440
um those are three discrete decisions

870
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,859
that are at the top of the

871
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,680
of the hierarchical generative model

872
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,960
with the

873
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,000
finer grain motor control below

874
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,400
thanks also just here's that classic

875
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,020
three faces figure

876
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,680
mode tracking this can be seen as using

877
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,619
a log of ultera pseudo random number

878
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,359
generator

879
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,900
to spit out higher level predictions

880
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,560
about which mode should be pursued

881
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,040
then as to the Dynamics of how that mode

882
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,780
is approached

883
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,940
one can either use the equilibrium

884
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,380
points

885
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,920
methods discussed in this chapter or

886
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,380
the more advanced Bayesian physics

887
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,420
methods to describe that in terms of

888
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,640
gauge Theory and so on is that fair to

889
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,759
say

890
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,400
oh

891
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,119
is this it jakub thank you Ali for

892
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,480
sending it

893
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,740
uh it's it's not the same it's not the

894
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,839
same one but it looks like a lot of the

895
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,880
slides are

896
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,940
the the same I think the thing that I

897
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,400
was referring to

898
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,040
I'm just trying to find the slide

899
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,500
oh yeah I think it might be

900
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,540
minute 41 okay

901
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,900
I I really can't wait till there's some

902
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,900
open source webcam software

903
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,820
to do

904
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,260
isicade analysis and um

905
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,240
pupil diameter

906
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,320
I don't think it would be that

907
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,940
intractable maybe you'd have to be kind

908
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,320
of close or you'd have to use a 4k

909
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,839
camera or something

910
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,520
but is there any software like that

911
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,540
available I've never come across it

912
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,380
just like

913
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,119
move the mouse to where I'm looking and

914
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,619
then click when I blink twice

915
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,540
isn't that kind of like that exists that

916
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,940
does exist but it but what is it called

917
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,400
or where is it being used

918
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,740
yeah

919
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,220
I know it's being used uh for

920
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,800
um people with physical impairments who

921
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,500
can't control the computer

922
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,760
uh

923
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,359
yeah otherwise yes I don't I haven't I I

924
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,619
haven't seen I haven't seen uh like an

925
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,200
analysis of people dilation

926
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,900
but eye tracking is definitely a thing

927
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,140
okay maybe we can explore it

928
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,760
um all right so yeah the blinking

929
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,460
example was a puff of air so it was just

930
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,800
like a beep and then a puff of air

931
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,980
and so then they learn that the they

932
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,420
learn to preempt the air Puff

933
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,680
okay

934
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,839
learning in continuous models eight two

935
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,440
continuous time domain accumulating

936
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,300
evidence this works if we treat data in

937
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,359
a series of small time intervals

938
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,640
oh no don't discretize

939
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,480
um this relates I think to some of the

940
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,060
finer points on like which stochastic

941
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,579
calculus is used like the Edo calculus

942
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:24,300
in the Bayesian mechanics

943
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,160
um

944
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,020
we won't go into it unless anybody

945
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,240
really wants to say more but this looks

946
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,280
like important just to learn about the

947
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,020
integrals and the gradients

948
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,540
okay pomdp has largely superseded the

949
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,980
use of the generalized lockable

950
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,660
terrorist systems

951
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,200
inactive inference applications

952
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,880
and that was kind of I think related to

953
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,920
asking first about why things moved away

954
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,480
from the lockable terror formulations

955
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,200
Lorenz system

956
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,200
also explored in stochastic chaos Markov

957
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,118
blankets live stream 32.

958
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:11,040
it's it's almost it's dealt with as

959
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,960
minimally as you could possibly deal

960
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
with the Lorenz system

961
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,920
in eight seven okay

962
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,520
eight four generalized synchrony

963
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,440
so multi-aging inference starts coming

964
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,660
into play as well as agent environment

965
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,099
synchronization and we actually like

966
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:27,480
talked a little bit about the bird song

967
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,240
in the previous hour

968
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
um now the Run system comes back

969
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,240
and yes it's dealt with like sort of

970
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,240
in the 2015 frith and friston

971
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,060
paper active inference communication and

972
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,859
hermeneutics

973
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,660
and that's where the synchronization

974
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,359
manifold is kind of displayed and then

975
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,700
more recently in

976
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,500
um

977
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,859
live stream 32

978
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,380
is um and this one has a DOT three I

979
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,700
think this might be the only dot three

980
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,598
as of this point

981
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,460
I think Connor Hines could only come at

982
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,359
a later date yeah

983
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,240
so these are good discussions

984
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,579
on the lorenza tractor a couple Duran

985
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,119
systems

986
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,180
this is kind of um very similar if not

987
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,980
identical to the uh bird song

988
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,540
synchronization manifold in first and

989
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,819
forth 2015.

990
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,839
birds birds birds

991
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,319
um

992
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,060
bird synchronization isn't real

993
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,980
then hybrid discrete models

994
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,119
um

995
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,640
hybrid mix models

996
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,460
not that kind of mixed model

997
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,560
allow inferences about sequential action

998
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,119
plans and translations of those

999
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,680
decisions into movements through a

1000
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,540
continuous model

1001
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,040
so

1002
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,380
in that respect

1003
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,920
it's extremely linked to livestream 46

1004
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,420
active inference models do not

1005
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,819
contradict folk psychology which is all

1006
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:11,760
about that continuous time motor active

1007
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,960
inference

1008
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,300
discrete state-space decision active

1009
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,420
inference Mai and Dai and using those

1010
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,819
motor and decision active inference

1011
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,300
models

1012
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,319
while lower level model

1013
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,780
in the dashed box

1014
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,640
is the same form as the other models

1015
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,119
um in in other words it's continuous

1016
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,260
because we have V instead of Pi

1017
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,280
for the causal factors and F instead of

1018
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,720
B

1019
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,700
and G instead of a

1020
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,560
and uh

1021
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,480
ETA instead of

1022
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,020
G

1023
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,099
is it

1024
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,619
some mapping between well in this case I

1025
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,760
think just looking at it a little more

1026
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,119
narrowly how

1027
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,339
um outcomes

1028
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,900
map

1029
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,700
to slower causes of the world

1030
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,920
so here this is a discrete model up top

1031
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,500
with a G oh yeah that was one era that

1032
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,579
we found

1033
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,280
free-floating G

1034
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,040
can't live with it can't live without it

1035
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,599
but it should be connected to the pi of

1036
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,040
course

1037
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,020
um

1038
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,960
there's a discrete time model on top

1039
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,619
and then it is kind of cascading its

1040
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,060
outcomes

1041
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,839
down

1042
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,700
to these continuous time models

1043
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,859
so one could think about this like the

1044
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,440
lock of Volterra handwriting example

1045
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,359
kind of could it's not the exact

1046
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,300
structure of this but it's related

1047
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,160
okay

1048
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,540
um this is

1049
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,920
um something I know Jacob has thought

1050
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,940
about

1051
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,280
um how discrete and continuous models

1052
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,560
um interface

1053
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,540
because we've talked about how like the

1054
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,980
temperature could be continuous and the

1055
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,540
thermometer could be continuous but then

1056
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,280
the internal generative model could be

1057
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,680
like is it hot or not

1058
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,099
so another question of how to how to

1059
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,540
um

1060
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,020
move from generative models

1061
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,780
within between different parts of the

1062
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,940
model where where or what kinds of

1063
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,440
transitions between continuous and

1064
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,819
discrete State space is possible

1065
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,440
okay

1066
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,900
here's a continuous

1067
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,940
um isocate

1068
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,460
uh ocular motor paradigm

1069
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,359
where the continuous lines

1070
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,420
are still confusing but at least they

1071
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,960
are Justified

1072
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,800
eight three

1073
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,480
combining categorical and continuous

1074
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,099
generative models

1075
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,660
outside of active inference has

1076
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,099
primarily been framed to the lens of

1077
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,760
clustering

1078
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,020
the aim is to assign data points into a

1079
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,420
discrete cluster

1080
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,020
foreign

1081
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,000
sure about that I think clustering is

1082
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,099
one discretization clustering and

1083
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,660
thresholding is one discretization

1084
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,700
approach that's been used

1085
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,280
also just binning

1086
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,079
seems like a simpler method

1087
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,579
how do you say a continuous distribution

1088
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,140
of one through ten and make it

1089
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,520
categorical

1090
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,160
just bin it one through ten or you could

1091
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,599
cluster and do thresholds so then you

1092
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,740
could have

1093
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,099
um cluster one with 9.7 to 9.9 and then

1094
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,160
9.7 to 9.5

1095
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
um

1096
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:03,720
and then eight six

1097
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,380
there's a big table

1098
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,640
here's the songbirds

1099
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,980
this author isamura I believe is the one

1100
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,000
who will join

1101
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,040
per 51.

1102
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,660
in November and I think that'll be like

1103
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,880
our last probably one of our lost paper

1104
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,420
streams for the year

1105
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,460
we have some we have just this last

1106
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,619
discussion with Dalton next week

1107
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,440
and then interception and then the

1108
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,119
canonical neural networks perform active

1109
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,099

1110

1116
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,940
with four minutes left

1117
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,500
kind of an interesting chapter

1118
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,640
but I can only know it how I'm

1119
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,440
seeing it and I

1120
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,119
have serious questions about what it

1121
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,839
does in the book

1122
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,420
Eric

1123
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,819
um one thing I was puzzled by and maybe

1124
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,260
you guys can help me out with on the

1125
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,440
bird the bird song examples were they

1126
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,480
implying that um

1127
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,700
Bert starts singing

1128
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,240
another bird picks it up synchronizes

1129
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,119
using these Dynamics

1130
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:39,839
and

1131
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,180
um the proof of that is this other bird

1132
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,220
will just step in and take over and the

1133
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,599
first bird can stop

1134
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,099
I don't believe I've ever ever heard

1135
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,200
that happening are they suggesting that

1136
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,819
that happens or or what

1137
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,500
um

1138
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,819
okay I agree like whether it's a improv

1139
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,819
whether this is a bird improv

1140
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,559
conversation in this case they're

1141
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,260
singing from the same hem sheets

1142
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,020
so it's like somebody should be singing

1143
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,700
the bird anthem

1144
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,859
and now we're going to be engaging in

1145
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:16,619
this sort of Quasi dialogue

1146
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,960
where we're going to be

1147
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,119
reducing our surprise about hearing the

1148
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,339
song that we expect to hear

1149
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:25,380
which goes like you know

1150
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,839
insert your favorite song there

1151
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,460
um

1152
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,400
and then the phenomena that gets

1153
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,540
highlighted

1154
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,079
is the way in which

1155
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,780
um one bird is singing

1156
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,119
and then as it's singing its Precision

1157
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,000
starts to drift

1158
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,500
and then

1159
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,380
it stops singing and then the other bird

1160
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,300
finds itself picking up at the same

1161
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,660
point

1162
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,880
to reduce its surprise

1163
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,319
about that song being sung at the time

1164
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:02,880
but

1165
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,859
I think especially with it with a bold

1166
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:07,319
title like land claim to hermeneutics

1167
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:09,980
more broadly

1168
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,079
singing from the same

1169
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:18,480
pre-coordinated hem sheet

1170
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,440
is not the same thing as information

1171
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:28,040
updating or even just pure expressivity

1172
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,720
so I I think it

1173
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,640
it leaves

1174
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,040
gaping areas for people to actually

1175
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,020
develop

1176
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,420
because it's like well we have what

1177
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,400
don't we have databases of like millions

1178
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,200
of bird songs

1179
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,099
and natural soundscapes

1180
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,619
so like we need some bird watching

1181
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:56,460
active inference practitioners

1182
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,220
who want to actually develop

1183
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,619
the bird song Motif because otherwise it

1184
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:03,780
is too easy and ironically becomes

1185
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,119
singing from the same hymn sheet oh well

1186
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:09,420
hermeneutics has been addressed in 2015

1187
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,200
synchronization manifold 2015.

1188
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,920
um

1189
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,740
whereas this is like a very Fringe case

1190
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,260
of communication

1191
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,359
that is based upon

1192
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,040
um

1193
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,859
most charitably High reliability

1194
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:28,220
execution of

1195
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,960
pre-ordained performance

1196
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,839
which is a tiny Edge case of

1197
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,319
communication

1198
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,040
you know my understanding of bird songs

1199
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,040
is you know the the

1200
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,380
um baby birds here here the with their

1201
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,940
parents saying you know they've got some

1202
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,339
predisposition to to sing a certain kind

1203
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:51,000
of song and um for most birds you know

1204
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,980
there are some that are very adaptable

1205
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,079
you know parents parrots you know stuff

1206
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:57,660
like that but most birds

1207
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,720
um learn the accent and the or the um

1208
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,480
the dialect that they are raised in and

1209
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,540
that's the song that they always sing

1210
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,059
um and there's some variation on it I

1211
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,500
mean maybe they'll stop Midway through

1212
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,640
but what what are the true facts about

1213
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,780
I what I saw to be a claim here where

1214
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,420
birds will pick up

1215
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,599
from each other or one leaves off does

1216
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,760
that really happen I I I I'm not

1217
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,140
familiar with that happening I've never

1218
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,640
I don't think I've ever heard it

1219
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,619
happening and what my impression the way

1220
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,599
most birds sing is they'll sing their

1221
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,980
song all the way through

1222
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,020
and there might be a column response

1223
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,760
another one might

1224
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,040
might pick up uh you know might answer

1225
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,140
but I don't think I've ever here

1226
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,119
synchronizing of songs

1227
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,059
um but I might be just not well enough

1228
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:49,740
informed about the Ecology of those

1229
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,520
things

1230
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,480
yeah very interesting um

1231
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,200
questions

1232
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,280
and the whole area with game theory of

1233
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,960
song

1234
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,160
like

1235
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,559
it's beneficial that somebody warns

1236
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:09,180
about the Predator but then you've

1237
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,400
revealed your location when you sing and

1238
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,260
things like that like that's the kind of

1239
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,420
decision making

1240
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,460
and um uncertainty resolution and risk

1241
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,260
evaluation that I'd imagine

1242
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,380
in ancient-based bird song model

1243
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,200
wood oriented towards but those are some

1244
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,960
cool ways for us to go so

1245
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,640
um next week

1246
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,500
I I guess this is kind of a shorter

1247
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,400
chapter and it has some Arcane symbolism

1248
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,619
but also seemingly very skippable

1249
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:42,900
symbolism

1250
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,000
so I'm glad that we could get through

1251
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,500
the whole thing

1252
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,420
and um will return to any further

1253
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,460
thoughts on eights

1254
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,579
and then maybe we can have more of a uh

1255
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,540
seven plus eight synthesis

1256
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,300
as or anyone can look into any of these

1257
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,400
citations key advances

1258
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,339
as we head into

1259
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:10,260
um like chapter nine

1260
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,579
on empirical data

1261
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:17,520
which is not super long

1262
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,280
followed by 10

1263
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,160
which is just a restatement

1264
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,380
so

1265
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,780
um onwards we go thanks y'all bye

1266
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,859
thanks everyone
