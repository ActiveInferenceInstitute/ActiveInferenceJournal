2570	3646	1	A	0.54182	Alright, hello everyone.
3748	16750	2	A	0.99963	It is week eleven and we're in chapter five, part two of the active textbook group first cohort.
17890	29160	3	A	0.70259	We'll be now turning to some of the more direct questions on chapter five after having more of an overview last week.
30250	40540	4	A	0.95399	We'll also be concluding our regular chapter discussions for the first part of this book.
41150	66180	5	A	0.5	And in the coming two weeks, we'll be having some review and synthesis and connecting some dots, asking overarching questions, returning to questions that were based in a specific chapter and hopefully people like on their own or wherever else they're seeing as relevant or requesting new pages if they see something that they want.
67030	73666	6	A	0.99154	Providing some synthesis on this first half of the textbook, which is the epistemic half.
73768	87970	7	A	1.0	And then for people who want to continue in the textbook group, go to the onboarding page and there's two columns there's.
88130	91530	8	A	0.93118	Yes, for part two of cohort one, chapter six through ten.
91680	106270	9	A	0.87813	So check that box if you want to be included in starting in September going through chapters six through ten, which has like the recipe for active models and that's when we're going to be getting more hands on with modeling.
107570	118050	10	A	0.99998	Also, everyone is welcome to join for part one, chapters one through five, cohort two also starting in September.
119190	147606	11	A	0.99232	So it could be a fun experience just to get another coat of paint on the material, play a more active role, ask another set of questions informed by what you've seen in the first cohort so feel free to check those boxes and then also keep incubating as we head into chapter six and beyond.
147718	176150	12	A	0.99997	In the second half of the textbook, like the project ideas, several of the project ideas like related to what Mike and Noah have added, we've started to address and explore in the active block, for instance, meetings on Wednesday, especially related to cyber, physical systems, simulations, taxonomies for governance, these kinds of ideas.
176970	185720	13	A	0.71285	Brock's added some great notes about what is the ramp that gets someone to the low road or the high road.
186410	194330	14	A	0.74	And then I've recorded the first chapter and the first segments as an audiobook.
195390	215158	15	A	1.0	The first chapter doesn't have any equations so it's straightforward to read, but the subsequent chapters do have equations, which is motivating having the natural language representations of the equations.
215354	222802	16	A	0.95686	So there's still a ton of discourse questions that can be asked why things are one way, why things are a different way.
222936	227366	17	A	0.99996	If it can be placed into the equation itself, that's great.
227468	238314	18	A	0.99999	If it needs to be somewhere else, hopefully the space exists and people can request, if not, but for example, when reading the textbook, the equations can be read this way.
238432	253994	19	A	0.99982	So those are just some of the projects that people can look forward to and the affordances to continue on, which is again going to the onboarding and participating in first five chapters.
254042	258366	20	A	0.99996	Again cohort two or going to continue?
258468	279490	21	A	0.99819	On with chapters six through ten starting in September for both of these so that we can complete one pass of the book by the end of the year and also probably make a lot of progress on different project ideas and project ideas arising as we start to see and build templates for the models.
279990	287880	22	A	1.0	And also Ali has some nice interactive notebooks, so there will be a lot of great things coming together.
289790	292780	23	A	0.9993	If anyone wants to raise their hand, of course, just go for it.
294350	301840	24	A	0.99527	Otherwise we will be continuing with the questions asked about Chapter Five.
303170	312334	25	A	0.51005	Before we go to the questions, is there any general comment that somebody wants to add about Chapter Five?
312532	317220	26	A	0.91073	Their reading of it, their rereading of it, listening to the video from last week?
318710	332440	27	A	0.99958	How is chapter Five hitting them today's?
341260	345790	28	A	0.89	To kind of maybe bring that one step closer to a specific question.
347120	360000	29	A	0.99927	I'm not going to read this whole quote, but this question says in the preface they wrote in Chapter Five, we will move from formal treatments to biological implications of active inference.
361860	372260	30	A	0.99998	This AIDS in mapping the abstract computational principles of active inference to specific neural computations that can be executed by physiological substrates.
373480	379940	31	A	0.99885	This is important in forming hypotheses under this framework and ensures that these are answerable to measure data.
380090	384680	32	A	0.744	In other words, Chapter Five sets out the process theory associated with active inference.
385820	389610	33	A	0.86805	Is this how people saw chapter five?
389980	393484	34	A	0.99479	Do they feel like it did something different?
393602	406400	35	A	0.9997	Did it succeed at making the abstract computational principles linked or mapped to specific neural computations executed by physiological substrates?
424480	424892	36	A	0.85098	Yes.
424946	427812	37	B	0.99384	Eric, first of all, I have to apologize.
427896	438530	38	B	0.99602	Only watched half of last week's discussion, so I may be talking about ground that's been covered before.
440840	459450	39	B	0.81007	It just seems to me that I've seen many, many papers trying to map theories onto brain circuitry and physiology, and I'm not well enough.
460940	466036	40	B	0.99882	I'm only loosely associated with neuroscience and don't follow it very closely.
466068	469484	41	B	0.99777	So it's hard for me to cite specific instances along the way.
469522	473852	42	B	0.99	I know you mentioned no Menta, which is one of the more recent ones.
473906	478030	43	B	0.83132	It's trying to say these are what the layers are doing.
478900	501908	44	B	0.98899	So this chapter to me didn't seem any very qualitatively different from anybody else's very hand wavy way to say here's what the computations are all about and here's how they map to what brain circuitry could map to what brain circuitry might be doing.
502074	514330	45	B	0.99955	It's all quite hand wavy, I find, and I guess plausible, but it's certainly not definitive, nothing close to that.
518220	531360	46	B	0.99987	Maybe one other comment I would say is, again, in this chapter, they use this word prediction in a way that conforms to the theory.
531860	549060	47	B	0.94538	But to say that what's happening in, say, motor control, where top down signals from the cortex go down to the ganglia in the spinal cord in order to invoke motor patterns.
550520	573950	48	B	1.0	To call that a prediction is, to me, a kind of well, that's taking extreme measures to map the concepts of the theory onto what neurons are doing and if the theory works out to be very useful in some way and that's what you have to do to make that happen.
574640	592550	49	B	0.99773	Okay, I guess I can use that language, but Operaria just does not seem like the right language to use to say, yeah, we're trying to set up some motor patterns, set up some context and situations for what we want the local reflexes to be doing.
593560	597588	50	B	0.99493	But to cast that as a prediction just seems a little unnatural to me.
597754	600980	51	B	0.99911	So those are my two reactions to this chapter.
601800	604090	52	A	0.99981	Thank you.
605740	607850	53	A	0.99856	Anyone else with a raised hand?
613580	630400	54	A	0.99323	This is a really good point about what the linkage or mapping is between without going into, like, you know, is anything physical or, et cetera, like physical brains in their niche and any type of equations.
631140	635504	55	A	0.72372	Would a well fitting linear model say that the brain is a linear model?
635702	640480	56	A	0.99996	Does a well fitting Bayes graph imply that the brain is a Bayes graph?
641060	652324	57	A	0.99997	Does a well fitting Bayes graph plus a philosophical belief that we're just making a map, we're not describing the territory equate to what beyond a linear model or a verbal model.
652442	653380	58	A	0.94861	Rohan.
655260	655672	59	C	0.99534	Yeah.
655726	658170	60	C	0.87043	Building on the previous point right.
659340	677404	61	C	0.99816	I'm still unsure about what Active inference is, considering a signal, there's no effective well, there's no noise model or it doesn't specify that here's, because if you say that I'm predicting something, right.
677442	687484	62	C	0.94188	So there must be something that is substantially different, statistically different from some noise distribution that you can differentiate.
687532	688080	63	C	0.82567	Right.
688230	697220	64	C	0.7625	So it's basically trying to estimate some hidden probabilities, which is not really a signal.
698360	699428	65	C	0.99242	Does that make sense?
699514	712760	66	C	0.99966	Because even the internal states, unless they're actually instantiated prior, like when we set up the model, we say, okay, these are the only states that you can actually traverse.
715600	720620	67	C	0.98289	You still have to infer the states from your measurements of reality.
724080	725070	68	A	0.99978	Thank you.
730660	731836	69	A	0.76038	Jacob?
732028	732384	70	D	0.99908	Yeah.
732422	764068	71	D	0.99	I just want to ask if the noise isn't kind of implied in the POMDP formalism, like, I think in Figure 5.4, where it shows the direct and indirect pathways of message passing, it describes Active and the basic ganglia as a POMDP generative model.
764234	766584	72	D	0.77993	So it's partially observable.
766632	769260	73	D	0.99972	Doesn't that imply some kind of noise?
772480	778944	74	C	0.99997	My counter to this would be that is missing information that needs to be filled out.
778982	780652	75	C	0.99846	That's not really noise.
780716	781232	76	C	0.55311	Right.
781366	791730	77	C	0.65345	So noise would be something let's not use this.
793080	813924	78	C	0.91299	So we have returns of a stock, and looking at the distribution of the prior returns, we know what the spread is, and in case we want to measure whether your portfolio is substantially different from this distribution, that's where we would have some sort of, like, sharp ratio or a signal noise ratio.
814052	821630	79	C	0.99996	Noise ratio being the complete set of distributions that are possible, the set of ranges that are possible.
823680	827788	80	C	0.99996	That is not really here, because that is missing information.
827874	839436	81	C	0.99661	So we can only observe the fact that we have only partial observations does not excuse the fact that we don't have even noise models of the sensors.
839468	842230	82	C	0.99152	So how good are the sensors, for example?
843480	845990	83	C	0.99988	Do we have some idea of that?
847400	847812	84	D	0.97404	Yes.
847866	851460	85	A	0.27396	Yaku, but then I'll add a point about the Espasian terminology.
852120	852870	86	D	0.99835	Yeah.
859500	882080	87	D	0.41348	What's the practical difference between partial observation where the noise implies some kind of information that is missing, versus a distribution that's added to full observation that adds noise to the sensory processing?
885140	885890	88	D	0.91565	Great.
889220	897364	89	C	0.95279	So if I use an actual physical sensor, right, it would be something like what are the ranges of values that it can go up to?
897402	905960	90	C	0.99998	Because we've designed the sensor, so we basically know what the bias is, what the variance of the sensor is under different conditions.
907900	911716	91	C	1.0	There are actual physical processes implied in that measurement.
911828	922424	92	C	0.93686	So in the case of ultrasonic sensor, it's probably like some current value or some voltage value that's being measured by some circuitry somewhere.
922552	924430	93	C	0.99977	So there are ranges for that.
924800	927788	94	C	0.99362	So there's no missing information there.
927954	933616	95	C	0.83946	So you basically know it's already a prior in this system, right.
933638	935888	96	C	0.99994	So you know what the ranges of values are going to be.
935974	939952	97	C	1.0	And from there you need to infer the sum state in the world.
940006	942870	98	C	0.99986	So is there an obstacle in the way or is there?
946200	950692	99	A	0.99959	Okay, let me just make a comment about some basing terminology then.
950826	955844	100	A	0.85619	Jessica and Brock so let's look at figure 4.3.
955882	961224	101	A	0.99998	This is the partially observable Markov decision process that Jacob talked about.
961262	971928	102	A	0.99994	But we're going to be just talking about the perceptive part, not the action intervention into how things are changing, yet just focusing on this motif on the left, like step by step guide uses.
972104	976280	103	A	0.99765	So you mentioned about the bias related to measurements.
976360	1008490	104	A	0.99988	So if the measurables are the observable sense states, then the bias and the covariance and the variance about how the reading on the thermometer relates to the underlying variable, the hidden state, the temperature of the room, it's embodied in the a matrix because that is actually the learned or fixed variable that is playing a role of a noise model.
1009260	1020380	105	A	0.99999	Then you mentioned when talking about returns on stocks, testing whether there's like a substantial difference from some null expectation, like is there a signal that's different from the noise?
1021360	1023464	106	A	0.99999	This is like a frequentist approach.
1023592	1027820	107	A	0.99991	It's based upon determining whether there's some statistically significant level.
1027890	1040640	108	A	0.59489	Doesn't have to be, it's not the only way to do it, but one can do like a p value on whether a given signal is statistically different from given a noise model, different from noise.
1041160	1045264	109	A	1.0	And then like, the sharp ratio and other types of things are like summary statistics.
1045312	1047140	110	A	0.94302	They're like descriptive statistics.
1050520	1072536	111	A	0.43008	Noisy measurements are addressed in the context of the POMDP by having an a matrix that accommodates some of the features of denoising a signal and then precision variables and those precisions can again be learned or fixed.
1072728	1087004	112	A	0.99914	But like the functional aspects of what is being referred to as noisy measurements are accommodated within this kind of Bayesian approach.
1087052	1108792	113	A	0.99998	Which is why common filtering, generalized Bayesian filtering, why these techniques are used because we can have a Bayesian update scheme implemented with variational approaches, message passing, sampling, all these things that does denoise signal, and it does embody a noise model and a signal model.
1108926	1113400	114	A	1.0	And that's all part of the generative model of the cognitive entity.
1113820	1118910	115	A	0.90876	So it just isn't being addressed from a frequentist statistics or.
1121120	1123704	116	C	0.9931	Yeah, I shouldn't have brought up the Sharp ratio.
1123752	1125132	117	C	1.0	Maybe that's not the best.
1125266	1133664	118	C	0.99998	But the Sharp ratio is effectively some way to say that some portfolio choice is different from others.
1133782	1138800	119	C	0.77	Or in communication systems you would use something like EB over N zero.
1138950	1151024	120	C	0.81289	That's the signal to noise ratio for any sort of communication system, but they're not necessarily only frequentist.
1151072	1151284	121	C	0.87095	Right.
1151322	1155092	122	C	0.89398	So there are patient ways to estimate these things.
1155146	1163044	123	C	0.99699	In fact, that's pretty much how we do it in practice, is we don't assume that we know the complete distribution.
1163092	1166040	124	C	0.99883	We update priors in each of these cases.
1170160	1173372	125	C	0.93429	Coming back to your point that the A matrix does address this.
1173426	1182160	126	C	0.91	The A matrix would be something that you said it would denoise and filter out some stray observations.
1182580	1193430	127	C	0.62668	But okay, the question still remains is when you're saying prediction, is it prediction of the signal over here?
1194280	1197488	128	C	0.99166	As in what is the future state of the sensor?
1197664	1208536	129	C	0.83603	But I think there, it seems seem to indicate that the prediction relates to the free energy minimization itself.
1208638	1208904	130	C	0.93349	Right.
1208942	1230728	131	C	0.99977	So you choose policies that would minimize your free energy and keep yourself into some set point, which means that there should be some sort of an idea of what ranges are there for this value or how far can these go before you're not in that set point anymore?
1230904	1235472	132	C	0.9993	So even if you, if you do want to make that prediction, it's, it's not just the signal value.
1235526	1240988	133	C	0.98605	So signal values effectively through the Marco blanket, they affect some internal state.
1241174	1246196	134	C	0.97	And I'm assuming that's what we are trying to predict, that the trajectory of.
1246218	1257450	135	A	0.7	The future internal states actually the expectation that's being minimized is over outcome observations, not about internal states.
1258380	1258792	136	C	0.99894	Okay?
1258846	1259160	137	C	0.93115	Yeah.
1259230	1260090	138	C	0.84597	I'm sorry.
1262460	1278350	139	C	0.99937	Even then, the signals may have well defined precision and bias, but the entire system itself doesn't have any sort of well, it doesn't know how wrong it can go.
1278880	1280824	140	C	0.99963	It doesn't have any error estimate.
1280952	1282956	141	C	0.72327	So there's no noise model.
1283058	1298420	142	C	0.93298	As such, we would have to assume that there is some distribution of states and then then use something like lee squares or some other optimization routine to actually bring this in practice.
1300040	1300500	143	A	0.99984	Great.
1300570	1301670	144	A	0.74116	Totally possible.
1302360	1315988	145	A	0.99756	It would be interesting to sketch out a Bayes graph for what you believe a signal to noise or some type of noise model would embody and maybe we will see some analogies or some mappings.
1316164	1317880	146	A	0.99619	Jessica and then Brock.
1320620	1321332	147	E	0.56297	Hi.
1321486	1328620	148	E	1.0	I think someone like what I was going to say probably already been covered by both you and Rohan in the new comments.
1328700	1339250	149	E	0.99839	But I was going to say that with this filtering and a lot of the biases and things, I kind of made sense of it.
1341880	1344644	150	E	0.92	I think it was like chapter two or something like that.
1344842	1362410	151	E	0.74878	So the why is this quote unquote thing that we can observe from the hidden state or the process of something that we don't know for everybody.
1362860	1368900	152	E	1.0	We can see the same thing, but how we process it internally is going to vary.
1369060	1370484	153	E	0.92227	It's going to be very subjective.
1370532	1376920	154	E	0.99976	So the why is going to look different for Daniel than it's going to look for me based on all this filtering.
1377080	1392370	155	E	0.92	And so the blanket states, I imagine, sort of like what have those filters that encode the biases and other things that allow us to process things differently than our generative model.
1393780	1414520	156	E	0.8154	It's going to be updated differently, also encoded, I think in the general model will be a lot of cures and things like that that embody, I think, probably a lot of biases and things of how we understand things which also influence how we interpret what we observe.
1416400	1420504	157	E	0.4985	So for me, it's like a lot of these things are there in terms of statistics.
1420632	1431868	158	E	0.99	I don't know how much, but that's how conceptually, I understood a lot of these things.
1432034	1438000	159	E	0.6774	Basically, in the blanket days of the Marco blanket, it would have a lot of disfaltering.
1439860	1440610	160	E	0.55483	Yes.
1442040	1462040	161	E	0.99696	If you're going to try to, let's say you observe something that's different than what you predicted in your model, then you would take action and to forage and find information and to figure it out, okay, what am I missing?
1462540	1474024	162	E	1.0	Why did I make this mistake or like this error in my prediction so that I can have more information and update the model so that it aligns more closely?
1474072	1485090	163	E	0.99161	So then you will basically take action to the noise and basically get closer to the reality that's out there.
1485780	1486192	164	E	0.80499	Yeah.
1486246	1491316	165	E	1.0	I don't know if this official lightning, but that's how it kind of makes sense to me.
1491498	1493300	166	A	0.99955	Thanks, Jessica Brock.
1496280	1510000	167	F	0.99895	Yeah, I just wanted to, I guess, speak to this sensor noise model in practice.
1510080	1531664	168	F	0.99992	In reality, when we're talking about sensors, like in a physical system, like, like a digital signal processing kind of context, like, the sensors are tested under some conditions for things like jitter and spurious kind of noise conditions and stuff like that.
1531702	1544470	169	F	0.99993	But they're tested under some conditions, meaning that there's never ever going to be a time when you have an actual model.
1545160	1553530	170	F	0.98282	You're just going to have an approximation whether that's expressed in a frequentness or Bayesian way.
1553980	1566732	171	F	0.9973	There's going to be some uncertainty in the model and especially if you start connecting it up to a larger system doing the same.
1566786	1586770	172	F	0.99985	Kind of like is the jitter in that sensor the same when it's completely isolated as it is when it's on a six x nine PCB board with 12 volts on one side and an oscillator next to that.
1590020	1591430	173	F	0.9999	Is it the same thing?
1593000	1598550	174	F	0.99892	You have to do these sort of electromagnetic compatibility resonance sort of testing on it.
1601640	1617710	175	F	0.99999	In practice it's Bayesian like you're doing the same sort of bounding and belief testing and finding your errors and correcting them.
1618640	1620060	176	F	0.99992	Even in practice.
1622560	1646224	177	F	1.0	I don't see how you could possibly have, even physically a system that could exist where you had a noise model that you could write down that was actually the noise model under all conditions or yeah, it doesn't seem like a approachable.
1646352	1646932	178	F	0.56	I don't know.
1646986	1651510	179	F	0.85452	It's not even not tractable, but just a wrong thing to do.
1653340	1654600	180	A	0.84822	Thanks, Brock.
1656220	1666012	181	A	0.94076	In the case of engineering and designing models, it's up to the designer or the engineering team to understand what is adequate or not.
1666066	1672840	182	A	1.0	And for natural systems outside of their bounds, natural selection sweeps them off the table.
1673000	1694100	183	A	0.99831	So some of the adequacy questions are either based upon specified or implicit human standards or the failure to resist dissipation and therefore the failure to realize repeated measurement of oneself or from the external.
1694520	1700870	184	A	1.0	And then that system is no longer let's just continue to move through some of the questions.
1701880	1702656	185	A	0.99999	Yes, Rohan.
1702688	1703510	186	A	1.0	Go for it.
1705420	1709192	187	C	0.999	Yeah, I completely agree with what Brock said.
1709246	1709512	188	C	0.96756	Right.
1709566	1730424	189	C	0.99812	But my point was, when you say that you're predicting something, it means that you either know the quantity that you're trying to predict and it corresponds to so in this case, some action results in some reward.
1730552	1735810	190	C	0.96	I guess you could predict the reward, but without knowing how wrong you're going to be in the future.
1736180	1744096	191	C	0.55443	So where exactly any living system would have to be aware of its own bounds.
1744128	1744516	192	C	0.9939	Right?
1744618	1747732	193	C	0.7453	That's what I meant by noise model.
1747786	1762292	194	C	0.99983	So it has to know that it has to stay within some bounds and as it starts coming closer to one of the upper or lower bounds, there should be something like pulling it back down or some feedback mechanism.
1762436	1771964	195	C	0.51681	But that is not very clear from what I've read so far on active inferences, how exactly it would estimate that.
1772162	1774780	196	C	1.0	You can just say free energy minimization.
1775920	1780680	197	C	0.95789	But what is a minimum in this case that would be different for different systems?
1780760	1785344	198	C	0.47841	It should have some idea of where the surface is of whichever local surface it's lying on.
1785382	1786690	199	C	0.51567	That was my point.
1787380	1789404	200	A	0.99973	So for sure it's different for different systems.
1789452	1792710	201	A	0.65434	It's different as every single generative model is.
1793480	1797264	202	A	0.97	And then you mentioned like a pullback attractor.
1797392	1818120	203	A	0.95	And so this has been treated extensively in the context of physiological measurements and then again where those priors on the physiological measurements are, the Tolerable range are either provided by the human engineering team or through evolution by natural selection and then the quantity.
1818640	1843632	204	A	0.99992	Another related topic would be expectation maximization models, which is what is happening essentially in the dialectic between the observation and the hidden state update is an expectation maximization like process where it's like given the hyper priors or we can just simplify, given the priors on S, what are the most likely or the distribution of observables.
1843776	1850128	205	A	1.0	And then given the observables, what should be updated about the hidden state priors.
1850304	1867516	206	A	1.0	And when those are at convergence, the model is stationary and then as things change, either from the top via learning or context shift or through changed measurements, the expectation maximization algorithm is just able to track those changes.
1867618	1873340	207	A	1.0	And that can, in the context of a fixed prior, have the function of a pullback attractor.
1875120	1878476	208	A	0.72396	Okay, and that's even before getting into action specifically.
1878508	1894448	209	A	0.99725	But yes, definitely considering the role of comparing future plans of action and which plans of actions will have the least expected free energy based upon their pragmatic and Epistemic value.
1894614	1907008	210	A	0.52518	Like the Epistemic just being clarity around how it's going to be achieved and the pragmatic value being that KL divergence between the expectation slash preferences and the expected observations.
1907184	1920140	211	A	0.99068	So if we expect slash preferred to be in homeostasis, the pragmatic value is going to come or be loaded onto policies that keep us in homeostasis, even if some other one is super informative.
1920640	1926248	212	A	1.0	How that model gets tuned is quite literally the details of how the model is trained.
1926344	1926988	213	C	0.91322	Right.
1927154	1930044	214	C	0.99995	My point was that active inference doesn't help us find this.
1930082	1938770	215	C	1.0	We have to find this ourselves and then hopefully once we have instantiated these bounds, I think active inference works very well to keep it within this.
1939300	1951792	216	C	0.96339	If you can't discover this de novo, I can't have what you'd say table or asset type system, like a blank slate system, go out in the world and discover your bounds.
1951936	1953432	217	C	0.99424	That's not going to happen.
1953486	1957288	218	C	0.60694	But this kind of method is what I was making it out.
1957374	1966644	219	C	0.90717	Whereas taking something equivalent without any so deep learning is another method.
1966692	1966856	220	C	0.99948	Right?
1966878	1970172	221	C	0.99833	So you just feed it a lot of data, it doesn't have to know anything about the data.
1970226	1977468	222	C	0.99694	Eventually it forms some opinion about the data it's seen and then it's able to do some classification depending on how much data it's seen.
1977554	1980524	223	C	0.97338	So it's able to build certain amount of bounds.
1980652	1984016	224	C	0.99974	Whether that's generalizable is a different question.
1984118	1995108	225	C	0.99998	But here the learning part does not say much about how exactly it goes about discovering where its limits are.
1995194	1996356	226	C	0.99894	That's my point.
1996538	1997028	227	A	0.99996	Sure.
1997114	1997940	228	A	0.99997	Thank you.
1998090	1998900	229	A	0.9996	Eric.
2002280	2020856	230	B	1.0	I would love to dive just a little bit more into the thing you were just talking about, how expectation maximization is a mathematical formulation for how to infer belief states from observations.
2021048	2037916	231	B	0.99989	Because you basically go through this iterative process of trying to find alignment between the states of the belief and the observables and then you contract that over time between that concept and the concept of message passing.
2038108	2058344	232	B	0.98781	When I think of message passing, I think of some sort of a distributed system where you have some local computation and then it sends and you have again either synchronous or asynchronous process for communicating between these kind of different centers of belief state.
2058542	2064200	233	B	1.0	And then again, through message passing, you have often an iterative process of convergence.
2064540	2066984	234	B	0.99854	So those are not the same thing.
2067022	2078444	235	B	1.0	And I think message passing, to my understanding, would be an Em algorithm under certain types of messages and states at each of the nodes that you're sending the messages around.
2078642	2083100	236	B	0.99985	But not all message passing is going to be an Em algorithm.
2083180	2086204	237	B	1.0	And similarly, when I think of Em, I don't think about message passing.
2086252	2104940	238	B	1.0	I think about making an arrays of belief and matrices between mapping between belief and observations and then trying to compute an expectation for what my predictions would be and then making this iterative convergence.
2104960	2106692	239	B	0.98727	So I don't think of that in terms of message passing.
2106756	2112410	240	B	0.78061	So I just love to hear other people's ideas about how to tie these two ideas together.
2113740	2118760	241	A	0.99456	Yeah, Brock, if your hand is still raised.
2120160	2121996	242	A	0.99165	Okay, sorry.
2122098	2123470	243	A	0.92768	Yeah, all good.
2126800	2129090	244	A	0.99999	Does anyone have thoughts on this?
2130420	2136172	245	A	0.83515	There's a lot to say about the expectation maximization algorithms.
2136316	2141990	246	A	0.74	And just to kind of give a little context, this is the step by step paper.
2142680	2147700	247	A	0.98941	So this is the model stream one, it's four parts.
2148680	2154840	248	A	1.0	And this is like really a quite relevant figure, which is not in the textbook but helps a lot.
2154990	2160932	249	A	0.94558	Like this is the essence of the partially observable Bayesian inference.
2160996	2171916	250	A	0.68623	There's a prior D and then there's an a ambiguity matrix that is mapping in a generative capacity between hidden states s and observation measurements O.
2172018	2184624	251	A	1.0	This is the tail of two densities because O through A can give you the most likely S and S through A can give you the most likely O.
2184822	2196720	252	A	1.0	And it turns out that by alternating those procedures in a Bayesian update context, that two stroke engine is called expectation maximization.
2196880	2214440	253	A	0.99992	Again, because given expectations on the summary statistics of A distribution, the expected sensory observations can be generated and then given those observations, a likelihood function can be maximized that then updates the hidden states.
2214590	2226300	254	A	0.99993	So this motif, this kind of elbow motif is then extended into a caterpillar with this be, which is how the hidden state changes through time.
2226450	2232576	255	A	0.99998	So importantly, note what's not there, which is like the observations being chained through time.
2232758	2237216	256	A	0.50445	So it's not that the temperature reading at one moment influences the temperature reading at the next moment.
2237318	2247030	257	A	1.0	The temperature readings are continually linked, synchronously like in one time slice to their hidden states.
2247400	2260564	258	A	0.9866	So then when action gets into the picture, we've talked about like several sources that's like the equation 2.5 to equation 2.6 phase change, because action brings in several kinds of uncertainty.
2260692	2266510	259	A	1.0	First off, you're reducing your uncertainty about observations which haven't happened yet.
2266960	2271340	260	A	0.85422	You're also having the unknown consequences of your actions.
2271760	2284800	261	A	1.0	And in order to have action selection that's relevant, one has to have a preference distribution over what kinds of observations they would like to be seeing so that action can guide it in that direction.
2285700	2288352	262	A	0.96308	Okay then.
2288486	2299540	263	A	0.6957	So that's the expectation maximization two stroke engine is basically graphically proposed here.
2299610	2316350	264	A	0.7	D is just the initiating set of parameters and then in a one shot way, like you can have a folder with a thousand images and do expectation maximization on it, or you could have something that's dynamical and do that type of expectation maximization through time.
2321280	2327684	265	A	0.66417	Eric asked how is it related to message passing on graphs?
2327832	2341204	266	A	0.97285	So I'm not familiar with all the details of this model, but you basically said it, which was that certain message passing systems implement Em.
2341402	2344900	267	A	0.99995	But of course not all message passing architectures implement Em.
2344970	2347956	268	A	0.8626	So message passing is more general than Em.
2348138	2368540	269	A	0.99994	Also, Em wouldn't have to be implemented through message passing, but there's like an area of intersection where the Em algorithm can be seen as a type of message passing under certain compute rules in a factor graph.
2369120	2374060	270	A	0.78	And Em, at least from here, may be used to break cycles in a factor graph.
2375760	2383970	271	A	0.56354	So it's always like how close to the kernel and the Platonic ideal of active inference are we talking?
2384580	2392870	272	A	1.0	And then how many heuristics and just ways of connecting things are possible.
2393640	2398980	273	A	0.70521	So I will now read the chat.
2406610	2408394	274	F	0.65024	That'S from previous context.
2408522	2410000	275	A	0.99886	Okay, thank you.
2413750	2417742	276	A	1.0	The statistical Parametric mapping textbook and documentation.
2417806	2433114	277	A	0.59498	SPM has a lot on Em variational inference and a lot of the parts that bring one to understand this a lot better.
2433232	2439622	278	A	0.99608	SPM is like almost like it doesn't include action that much because it's a neuroimaging.
2439686	2446430	279	A	0.99999	So the observations are neuroimaging, sensor fusion, different error modalities, like the whole monopoly.
2447810	2472390	280	A	1.0	And then SPM started to incorporate participant actions in this partially observable metabasian way and potentially that is what led Friston and colleagues towards a grander synthesis of inference and action under a statistically principled framework.
2476090	2494762	281	A	0.99932	Let's just see if there's any other these are all important questions and there's a lot to get up to them and then there's like a lot to go from the question, but these are all important things to raise if anyone has a thought on this.
2494816	2499386	282	A	1.0	How should we think about redundancy in neural systems in the context of active inference?
2499578	2509714	283	A	0.53391	So redundancy would be like if there's something that's playing a functional role but its removal is not damaging the function of the system.
2509912	2516766	284	A	0.98944	There's ten pillars knocking out one of them, the building stays up, so there's redundancy in the pillars.
2516958	2520550	285	A	1.0	What about the cases where the same neural circuits serve multiple functions?
2522010	2540922	286	A	0.99968	So how do we deal with the fact that there's like a many to many potentially or a complex mapping between system elements and system functions where sometimes removing node one does nothing, but removing node one and two does a lot of things, but then removing one, two and three and it's going back to being fine.
2541056	2542090	287	A	0.93518	Jessica.
2544990	2551502	288	E	1.0	I guess my comment is more like a question and maybe like ask Blue about it because this is what I feel.
2551556	2555262	289	E	0.99975	But this question made me think.
2555316	2555726	290	E	0.99998	About.
2555828	2576950	291	E	0.99642	It's not only like that the brain has this redundancy of things, but it's like if you have some kind of damage to your brain, another part of your brain that maybe was not used for something would develop that capacity and so it would create that ability.
2578250	2584842	292	E	0.94008	Neuroplasticity brand new even though it was not a redundancy to begin with.
2584976	2588170	293	E	0.77976	So I guess I'm more curious to understand this.
2588320	2593660	294	E	0.82121	So other people who know more like Blue and stuff about this.
2594130	2599840	295	E	0.99497	Basically that's kind of what this question made me think about and kind of wanting to understand more.
2602050	2602558	296	A	0.99991	Nice.
2602644	2603726	297	A	0.99985	Good question.
2603828	2604094	298	A	0.70693	Yeah.
2604132	2605774	299	A	0.99716	Blue wrote, Depends on your age.
2605892	2613890	300	A	0.90297	Different neuroplasticity mechanisms are differentially available throughout life for different organisms.
2615430	2622758	301	A	0.99997	Just one thought on this would be like the same neural circuits serving multiple functions might be totally the case.
2622844	2630978	302	A	0.9992	For example, and is the function of the heart to provide one pound of weight to the torso.
2631154	2633180	303	A	0.9733	It is a function of the heart.
2633870	2638954	304	A	0.89974	So identifying what function is being modeled is what's being done here.
2638992	2641740	305	A	0.99996	So let's just go to the example of figure five three.
2642430	2657746	306	A	0.99802	This neuron modifying it like a loss of function experiment or having it injured might influence more things than just the lower motor neuron descending message.
2657928	2661330	307	A	0.99992	So that'd be a case where it serves multiple functions.
2665810	2673570	308	A	0.99861	This is just one statistical model of this function, of this circuit.
2673910	2686242	309	A	1.0	And that returns to the earliest comments of Eric with like, okay, this is like Tantalizingly seeming like it's actually going to be describing the neuroanatomy.
2686386	2691350	310	A	0.99996	But then they say things like note the absence of dot dot dot dot dot dot dot.
2691930	2698570	311	A	0.99956	Note that there's a discrepancy between, for example, the reality of the anatomy and the base graph.
2699630	2704970	312	A	0.99998	This highlights that the connections implied by message passing schemes may not manifest as single synapses.
2707910	2713394	313	A	0.99788	So, okay, there's kind of false positives and false negatives.
2713522	2716310	314	A	0.9	The Bayes graph isn't just the anatomy.
2716810	2717960	315	A	0.99963	That's fine.
2718570	2722854	316	A	1.0	The linear regression between height and weight isn't the actual relationship between height and weight.
2722982	2730566	317	A	0.64	And the structural equation model of inequality is not the generator of inequality.
2730758	2735430	318	A	0.99989	So it's totally fair and shouldn't be expected to be otherwise.
2735590	2744298	319	A	0.99057	That the Bayes graph, the best fitting Bayes graph, the most didactic bays graph, the simplest Bayes graph, none of those recapitulate the anatomy.
2744394	2750370	320	A	1.0	And the Bayes graph that recapitulates the anatomy would not necessarily even be the best fitting.
2750950	2752766	321	A	0.95043	It's map and territory.
2752958	2761574	322	A	0.54	And if somebody has a special equation to break through that blanket, everybody would love to see it.
2761772	2774482	323	A	1.0	However, sometimes it's easy to gloss over that in principle challenge of mapping formalisms to biological systems.
2774626	2780614	324	A	0.99999	Because we see the cell and then the blanket is the membrane and we see the brain and it's like vision and action.
2780662	2793390	325	A	1.0	And it seems like it maps onto the physical or the anatomical structure of the world or the causal structure of the world, and it doesn't.
2794850	2806020	326	A	0.9998	So I hope people can add more thoughts about how we consider redundancy because it's a great question, but we'll leave it there.
2808310	2812310	327	A	0.99999	How are reflexes modeled in active inference?
2813050	2817314	328	A	0.662	Would they exist in an active inference module that is distinct from proprioception?
2817442	2819830	329	A	0.86687	Would they operate on different timescales?
2820810	2850434	330	A	0.99164	If anybody wants to add some context on it, a reflex arc relating to where reflex is defined as a function that is being relayed through the spinal cord of a mammal and not passing.
2850482	2858246	331	A	0.96475	Like you could have a nerve block in the cervical vertebra and it still is able to implement that's one definition of reflex.
2858438	2869818	332	A	1.0	Often it's also used slightly more broadly to mean like stimulus action, reproducible outcomes, but not every reflex has a perfect reproducibility, et cetera, et cetera.
2869994	2871630	333	A	0.66916	So it's kind of a continuum.
2872370	2876690	334	A	1.0	Yes, it would involve proprioceptive input.
2877350	2891190	335	A	0.92214	That proprioceptive input would be combined or juxtaposed with the descending prediction, resulting in an error.
2892090	2897910	336	A	1.0	And then that directionality and magnitude of the error in this model drives the reflex.
2899450	2904940	337	A	1.0	There can also be multiple timescales, but we haven't seen any nested modeling yet.
2905790	2908700	338	A	0.99748	This is just the one layer model.
2913490	2920746	339	A	0.98	The schematic on the left in figure five, one shows that layer five of cortex projects to spinal parameter neurons.
2920778	2923150	340	A	1.0	And this can be interpreted as a prediction.
2925190	2960570	341	A	0.9997	Okay, so this is this one helpful context, and it relates to this earlier highlighted section, which is like it's the interpretation, the interpretive link between some anatomical or biological feature phenotype and some parametric resonance with a model.
2963530	2975930	342	A	1.0	The validity of that ranges from pretty clear, pretty uncontroversial, pretty useful, pretty effective, to none of the above.
2977250	2984400	343	A	0.57	And it's hard to know what given interpretive links are doing.
2985250	2997342	344	A	0.99201	Like saying that this edge on this base graph can be interpreted as a descending excitatory connection or that might be used to generate specific testable hypotheses.
2997486	3007830	345	A	0.999	Like if we measured it during a period of excitation the activity of this neuron, we expect it to be increased, whereas if it was a descending inhibitory connection, et cetera.
3009210	3027260	346	A	0.99884	That's a great example of active inference being used in in a proactive way to generate hypotheses about biological systems that are going to be, as they said in the preface, answerable to measured data.
3029570	3039550	347	A	0.99842	By grounding in a computational model that is related to the neuroanatomy but isn't trying to be like a digital twin of the neuroanatomy.
3039890	3046050	348	A	0.99997	We can generate predictions about gain, loss of function, different measurements to make if they don't already exist.
3046470	3056550	349	A	1.0	And then that can be used to increase our confidence or reliability or falsify even a specific generative model as proposed.
3058330	3074010	350	A	0.99993	So there's so much discourse like continuing to the present day and surely beyond, as like all these questions and recently posted in the Discord about active inference or free energy principle isn't falsifiable.
3074750	3078426	351	A	0.78	Now, the funny link is it's not falsifiable.
3078538	3084826	352	A	0.99999	So it's been falsified, it can't be falsified, so it's incorrect.
3085018	3087502	353	A	0.91444	That's an interesting connection that some people make.
3087636	3089626	354	A	0.96824	But a linear model cannot be falsified.
3089738	3091806	355	A	0.9	A base graph cannot be falsified.
3091998	3105670	356	A	0.9998	Once any given linear model is presented in a context with constraints for a certain data type, then it's an empirical question of its accuracy and adequacy relative to other models.
3106970	3115820	357	A	0.89531	But at the abstract level of a neural network or linear model or active inference, falsification simply doesn't apply.
3120880	3138800	358	A	0.95887	But there's a lot that could be clarified about what are the utilities and some of the pitfalls of mapping biological or cyberphysical systems to active inference models.
3140020	3152950	359	A	0.99999	If it's a purely digital system or potentially even a cyberphysical system that's been designed a really certain way, it might be compatible with activ like essentially by fiat or by design.
3154440	3161000	360	A	0.86	One could make an artificial creature like an infer ant that is implementing active inference.
3162300	3171870	361	A	1.0	One could also model an ant in the field using a linear model or a levee flight or some other model or an active inference model.
3172800	3174712	362	A	0.99989	But those are two very different settings.
3174776	3188560	363	A	1.0	One in which sort of the rabbit was placed into the hat and then we have a rabbit analyzer and the other one being like we don't know what's in the hat, but we have a rabbit analyzer that we think applies to what is in this hat.
3200840	3207744	364	A	0.99896	Chapter five includes some evidence presented on different neurotransmitters.
3207792	3223560	365	A	0.99901	So it'd be interesting to see like, what other frameworks are able to be compatible or even provide unique explanations, predictions, et cetera, related to neurochemistry.
3224160	3232540	366	A	0.9779	Have neural networks ever been used to derive unique predictions or found compatibility with neurohormones neurochemicals?
3234400	3265140	367	A	1.0	And then again, they have a final figure in chapter five that's like a graphical overview of several of the systems that are described in the chapter specifically relating to the cortical cognitive functions and then the dialectic between habit and free energy driven planning here with Dopamine as a precision modulator with extensive further modeling presented in other papers.
3265300	3278410	368	A	0.94	And this even more basal motor selection mechanism based upon reflex arcs and proprioceptive error minimization and all of that.
3282140	3289100	369	A	0.99999	We raised these questions not to offer any answers, but to highlight some of the exciting avenues of future research in theoretical neurobiology.
3289260	3303216	370	A	0.65527	So a lot of the questions that are asked here in this paragraph, but also above, at the very beginning they said we're not saying how it is, we're just giving like the current process model understanding.
3303328	3308710	371	A	1.0	And then especially at the end, they raise even more speculative questions.
3309080	3314490	372	A	0.62472	So that takes us to the end of chapter five.
3315660	3317368	373	A	0.79884	That's the first half of the book.
3317454	3320890	374	A	0.99927	That's the epistemic component of the book.
3321900	3326620	375	A	0.99989	Well, a lot of it is epistemic, but that's the first five chapters.
3329440	3338320	376	A	1.0	The second five chapters, which are longer partially because of having more figures and things like that.
3338390	3349280	377	A	0.99999	But you can see there's more pages slightly in the second part of the book, though we've also read at least some of the appendices.
3351240	3362372	378	A	0.61399	That's where we're heading, which is picking up on chapter six in just a few weeks with a recipe for designing active inference models.
3362436	3375420	379	A	0.9998	So for those who stuck with the uncertainty for the first five chapters and stay in the game, more will become clear when the recipe for the dish is seen.
3375570	3387708	380	A	1.0	And then more will be clarified when the dish is prepared, and then when you cut the vegetables, and then when you design the dish and the recipe and all of that.
3387794	3390592	381	A	1.0	And that's like a journey that we're all going to be on.
3390726	3395372	382	A	1.0	The tools are not finalized and the kitchen is not completed, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
3395516	3414730	383	A	0.99066	So it's just a call for us to go to Onboarding and indicate our interest in continuing with one or the other cohort or sharing with any colleagues who you think might like to jump in to the second cohort of part one.
3415180	3427116	384	A	1.0	And then in the coming two weeks, we'll be able to take a step back, look over the chapter questions, but also think about more general questions that we're having.
3427298	3448080	385	A	0.991	Basic questions, meso questions, advanced questions, research avenues, and also turn to the project ideas where multiple of these are already active and there's spaces for people who want to facilitate or catalyze some other direction.
3448420	3454876	386	A	0.90808	So fun meeting everyone's.
3454908	3465016	387	A	0.99414	Welcome to stay on for Tools or head up to a room above if they just want to talk to other people about anything else.
3465198	3471400	388	A	0.9924	So thanks again for joining and see you in just a few minutes for Tools.
