1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
all right hello everyone it is week

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,460
11.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,540
and we're in chapter five part two

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,780
of the active textbook group first

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,820
cohort

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,720
will be now turning to some of the more

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,779
direct questions on chapter five after

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,960
having more of a overview

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,240
last week

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
we'll also

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,300
um

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
be concluding our regular chapter

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,460
discussions

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,100
for the first part of this book

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,820
and in the coming two weeks we'll be

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,940
having some review and synthesis

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,820
and connecting some dots

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,160
asking overarching questions returning

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,660
to questions that were based in a

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,120
specific chapter and hopefully people

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,520
like on their own or wherever else

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,559
they're seeing is relevant

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,040
or requesting new pages if they see

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
something that they want

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,240
providing some synthesis on this first

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,420
half of the textbook which is the

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,420
epistemic half and then

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,500
um for people who want to continue

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,780
in the textbook group

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,080
go to the onboarding page

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,860
and there's two columns there's yes for

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,780
part two of cohort one chapter six

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,180
through ten so check that box if you

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,939
want to be included in starting in

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,860
September

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,720
going through chapters 6 through 10

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,820
which has like the recipe for active

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,560
models and that's when we're going to be

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,460
getting more Hands-On with the modeling

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,960
also everyone is welcome to join for

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,500
part one chapters one through five

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,280
cohort two also starting in September

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,380
so it could be

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,780
um a fun experience just to get another

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,860
coat of paint on the material

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,220
play more active role ask another set of

47
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,080
questions informed by what you've seen

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
in the first cohort so feel free to um

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,819
check those boxes

50
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,170
and then also

51
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,560
[Music]

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,580
um

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,580
keep incubating as we head into chapter

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,980
um six and Beyond in the second half of

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,720
the textbook

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,500
um like the project ideas several

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,260
um of the project ideas like related to

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,500
what Mike and Noah have added we've

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,280
started to address and explore in the

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,220
active block runs meetings on Wednesday

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,440
especially related to like cyber

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,860
physical systems simulations

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,480
taxonomies for governance

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,879
these kinds of ideas

65
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,000
um Brock's added some great notes about

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,060
like what what is the ramp that gets

67
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,480
someone to the low road or the high road

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,959
um and then uh I've recorded the first

69
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,099
chapter

70
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,480
and the first segments as an audiobook

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,220
the first chapter doesn't have any

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,959
equations so it's

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,239
straightforward to read but the

74
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,659
subsequent chapters do have equations

75
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,798
which is um

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,000
motivating

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,099
having the natural language

78
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,519
representations of the equations

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,739
so there's still a ton of

80
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,319
um discourse questions that can be asked

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
why things are one way why things are a

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,580
different way if it can be placed into

83
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,879
the equation itself that's great if it

84
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,680
needs to be somewhere else hopefully the

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,659
space exists and people can request if

86
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,340
not but

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,379
um for example when reading the textbook

88
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,799
the equations can be read this way so

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,260
those are just some of the projects

90
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,920
that people can look forward to and the

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,319
affordances to continue on which is

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,340
again uh going to the onboarding and

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,980
participating in first five chapters

94
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,899
again cohort two or going to continue on

95
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,779
with chapters six through ten starting

96
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,759
in September for both of these so that

97
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,400
we can like complete one pass of the

98
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,979
book by the end of the year and also

99
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,380
probably make a lot of progress on

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,360
different project ideas and project

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,020
ideas arising as we start to see and

102
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,080
build templates for the models

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,259
and also like Ali has some nice

104
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,660
interactive notebooks so there will be a

105
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,580
lot of great things um coming together

106
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,479
if anyone wants to raise their hand of

107
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,360
course just go for it

108
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,259
otherwise we will be continuing with

109
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,460
the

110
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,300
questions asked about chapter five

111
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,000
before we go to the questions is there

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
any general comment that somebody wants

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,039
to add about

114
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,340
chapter five the reading of it they're

115
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,080
rereading of it listening to the video

116
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,780
from last week

117
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,180
how is chapter five

118
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,300
um

119
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,479
hitting them today

120
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
okay

121
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,620
um to kind of maybe bring that one step

122
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,919
closer to a specific question

123
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm not going to

124
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,419
read this whole quote but this question

125
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,039
says in the preface

126
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,560
they wrote in chapter 5 we will move

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,720
from formal treatments to biological

128
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,440
implications of active inference

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,020
this AIDS in mapping the abstract

130
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,180
computational principles of active

131
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,979
inference to specific neural

132
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,380
computations that can be executed by

133
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,500
physiological substrates

134
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,660
this is important in forming hypotheses

135
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,180
under this framework and ensures that

136
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,580
these are answerable to measure data in

137
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,080
other words chapter 5 sets out the

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,880
process Theory associated with active

139
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
inference

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,020
is this how people

141
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,060
saw chapter 5

142
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,759
do they feel like it did something

143
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,280
different did it succeed

144
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
at making the abstract computational

145
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,419
principles linked or mapped to specific

146
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,759
neural computations executed by

147
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,900
physiological substrates

148
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,180
yes Eric

149
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,500
you know first of all I have to

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,780
apologize I only watched half of last

151
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,900
year's last week's discussion

152
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,099
so I may be cut talking about ground

153
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,120
that's been covered before

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,099
um it just seems to me that you know

155
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,560
I've seen many many

156
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,940
I

157
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,940
um papers

158
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,660
um trying to map theories onto brain

159
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,880
circuitry and physiology

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,860
and it's

161
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,720
I I'm not well enough

162
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
um you know I spent you know I'm only

163
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,380
loosely associated with neuroscience and

164
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,639
you know

165
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
don't follow it very closely so it's

166
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,780
hard for me to cite specific instances

167
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,460
along the way I know you mentioned

168
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,099
numanta which is um you know one of the

169
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,780
more recent ones it's

170
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,120
trying to say this is these are what the

171
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,919
layers are doing

172
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,780
um so

173
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,680
this chapter to me didn't seem

174
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,740
um any very qualitatively different from

175
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,400
anybody else's very hand-wavy way to say

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,440
here's what the computations are all

177
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,979
about and here here's how they map to uh

178
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,860
what brain circuitry could map to what

179
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,919
base circuitry might be doing it's all

180
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,460
quite hand wavy I I find and

181
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,419
um

182
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,780
I guess plausible but um

183
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,299
it's certainly not definitive nothing

184
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,599
close to that so

185
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,700
um

186
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,019
maybe one other

187
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,019
one other comment I would say is um

188
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,560
again in this chapter they use this word

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,940
prediction

190
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,839
in a way that conforms to the theory

191
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,300
but to say that you know what what's

192
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,060
happening in

193
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,019
um say

194
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,620
um motor control where top-down signals

195
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,140
from the cortex go down to the ganglia

196
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,019
in the in the spinal cord in order to

197
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,720
invoke motor patterns

198
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
um

199
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
to call that a prediction is to me a

200
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,140
kind of um well that's that's taking

201
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,440
Extreme Measures to map the concepts of

202
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,300
the theory onto

203
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,100
what neurons are doing

204
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,940
and um you know if the theory works out

205
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,680
to be

206
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,440
you know very useful in some way and

207
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,060
that's what you have to do to to make

208
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,680
that happen

209
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,160
okay I guess I can use that language but

210
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,959
it operatory it just does not seem like

211
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,300
the right language to use to say yeah

212
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,980
we're trying to to set up some motor

213
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,019
patterns set up some some context and

214
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,240
situations for what we want the you know

215
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,640
the local reflexes and and to be doing

216
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,860
um but to cast that as a prediction just

217
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,899
seems a little unnatural to me

218
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,940
so those are my two reactions to this

219
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,800
chapter

220
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,399
thank you

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,439
anyone else with a raised hand

222
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,060
this is a really

223
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,060
good point about what

224
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,660
the linkage or mapping is between

225
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,579
uh without going into like you know is

226
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,040
anything physical or Etc like

227
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,399
physical brains in their Niche and any

228
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,260
type of equations

229
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,899
would a well-fitting linear model say

230
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,700
that the brain is a linear model

231
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,160
does a well-fitting base graph imply

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,040
that the brain is a base graph

233
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
does a well-fitting base graph plus a

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,940
philosophical belief that we're just

235
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,320
making a map we're not describing the

236
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,560
territory equate to what

237
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,019
Beyond a linear model or a verbal model

238
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,019
Rohan

239
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,540
yeah building on the previous point

240
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,040
right uh

241
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,600
I am still unsure what what uh active

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,220
inference is considering a signal

243
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,620
there's no effective

244
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,839
well there's no noise model or there's

245
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,600
it it doesn't specify that here's

246
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,180
because if you if you say

247
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,459
uh that I'm predicting something right

248
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,519
so there must be something that is

249
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,500
substantially different statistically

250
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,040
different from some noise distribution

251
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,420
that you can differentiate right so

252
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,200
it's basically trying to estimate some

253
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,420
hidden probabilities which is not really

254
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,100
Sigma

255
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,339
does it make sense because yours even

256
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,320
the internal States unless they're

257
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,579
actually

258
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,899
uh instantiated prior like when we set

259
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,519
up the model we say okay these are the

260
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,720
only states that you can actually

261
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,060
Traverse

262
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,120
it does not make you still have to infer

263
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,880
the States from your measurements of

264
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,300
reality

265
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,739
thank you

266
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,820
foreign

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,440
yeah I just

268
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,220
um

269
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,220
wanted to ask if the noise isn't kind of

270
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,440
implied in

271
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,060
um the pomdp formalism

272
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,660
like uh I think in figure 5.4

273
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,680
um

274
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
where it shows the direct and invert

275
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,480
Pathways with message passing

276
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,620
um

277
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,380
it describes

278
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,100
active in the basic ganglia

279
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,839
as a umdp generative model so if it's

280
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,639
partially observable doesn't that imply

281
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,839
some kind of noise

282
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,040
uh my counter to this would be uh that

283
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,380
is missing information that needs to be

284
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,959
filled out that's not really noise rate

285
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,480
uh so noise would be something

286
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,459
like if we

287
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:10,800
uh like it so even if we let's let's not

288
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
use this right it would be some so we

289
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,620
have like returns of a stock

290
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,320
and looking at the distribution of of

291
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,480
the prior returns we know what the

292
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,300
spread is and in case we we want to

293
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
measure whether your portfolio is

294
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,380
substantially different from this

295
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,839
distribution that's where we would have

296
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,639
some sort of like sharp Ratio or a

297
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,100
signal to noise ratio noise ratio being

298
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,260
the complete set of distributions that

299
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,339
are possible

300
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,320
this set of ranges that are possible

301
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,260
uh that is not really here because it

302
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,600
that is missing information so we can

303
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,800
only observe part the fact that we have

304
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,139
only partial observations does not

305
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,300
excuse the fact that we don't have

306
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,880
uh even noise models of the sensors so

307
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,760
how good are the sensors for example

308
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,500
I do we have some idea of that

309
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,660
yes but then I'll add a point about

310
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,000
these Bayesian terminology

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,100
yeah um

312
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
yes

313
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,160
um is there is there any like what's the

314
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,740
Practical difference between partial

315
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,320
observation where there's where the

316
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,180
noise

317
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,680
implies some kind of

318
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,220
information that is missing versus like

319
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,920
a distribution that's added to full

320
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,620
observation that

321
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,699
um

322
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,500
adds noise to like the sensory

323
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
processing

324
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,380
great so it so that would be some okay

325
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,660
so if I use an actual physical sensor

326
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,620
right

327
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,560
uh it would be something like what are

328
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,240
the ranges of values that it can go up

329
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,579
to because we've designed the sensor

330
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,680
so we would we basically know what the

331
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,839
bias is what the variance of the sensor

332
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,660
is under different conditions

333
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,139
uh there are actual physical processes

334
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,079
implied in that measurement so in the

335
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,779
case of uh

336
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,399
ultrasonic sensors probably like some

337
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,860
current value or some voltage value

338
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,839
that's being measured by some circuitry

339
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,779
somewhere so there are ranges for that

340
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,820
so it there's no missing information

341
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,019
there

342
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,720
so you basically know

343
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,420
so it's already prior in this system

344
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,040
right so you know what the ranges of

345
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,899
values are going to be and from there

346
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,899
you need to infer the some state in the

347
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,639
world so is there an obstacle in the way

348
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,500
or is there yeah

349
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,540
okay let me just make a comment about

350
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,180
some basic terminology then um Jessica

351
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,019
and Brock so let's look at figure

352
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,440
4.3 this is the partially observable

353
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,839
uh Markov decision process that Jacob

354
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,759
talked about but we're going to be just

355
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,380
talking about the perceptive part not

356
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,360
the action intervention into how things

357
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,160
are changing get just focusing on this

358
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
Motif on the left like step-by-step

359
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,120
guide uses

360
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,620
so

361
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,480
um you mentioned about the the bias

362
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,579
related to measurements so if

363
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,060
the measurables are the observable sense

364
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,360
States then the bias and the covariance

365
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,860
and the variance

366
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,959
about how like the reading on the

367
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,420
thermometer relates to the underlying

368
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,000
variable the the hidden State the

369
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,519
temperature of the room it's embodied in

370
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,620
the a matrix

371
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,620
because that is actually the learned or

372
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,600
fixed variable

373
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,940
that is

374
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,199
playing a role of a noise model

375
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,779
then you mentioned when talking about

376
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,360
Returns on stocks testing whether

377
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
there's like a substantial difference

378
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
from some null expectation like is there

379
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
a signal that's different from the noise

380
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
um this is like a frequentist approach

381
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,520
it's based upon determining whether

382
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
there's some statistically significant

383
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,179
level doesn't have to be it's not the

384
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,740
only way to do it

385
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,980
um but one can do like a p-value on

386
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,559
whether a given signal is statistically

387
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,539
different from given a noise model

388
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,959
different from noise and then like the

389
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,880
sharp ratio and other types of things

390
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,740
are like summary statistics they're like

391
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,319
descriptive statistics

392
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,319
um

393
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,820
noisy measurements

394
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,700
are addressed in the context of the

395
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,799
pomdp

396
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,360
by having

397
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
an a matrix that accommodates some of

398
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,260
the features of denoising a signal

399
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,620
and then Precision variables

400
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,240
and those precisions can again be

401
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,679
learned or fixed

402
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,580
but like the functional

403
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,580
um

404
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,860
aspects of what is being referred to as

405
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,780
noisy measurements

406
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,240
are accommodated within this kind of

407
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,980
Bayesian approach which is why common

408
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,200
filtering generalized Bayesian filtering

409
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,860
why these techniques are used because we

410
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,840
can have a Bayesian update scheme

411
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,820
implemented with with variational

412
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,640
approaches message passing sampling all

413
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,900
these things

414
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,980
that does denoise signal and it does

415
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,500
embody a noise model and a signal model

416
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,539
and that's all part of the generative

417
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,840
model of the cognitive entity

418
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,720
so it just isn't being addressed from a

419
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,419
frequent to statistics or

420
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,100
um

421
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,960
yeah I shouldn't have brought up the

422
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,000
sharp ratio maybe that's not the best

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,480
but the sharp ratio is uh

424
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,179
is effectively some way to say that some

425
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,100
portfolio choice is different from

426
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,280
others or in communication systems you

427
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,500
would see use something like EB over n0

428
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,419
that's the signal noise ratio for any

429
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,520
sort of communication system

430
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,960
so yeah yeah uh but they're not

431
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,940
necessarily only frequentest right so we

432
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,000
there are patient ways to estimate these

433
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,620
things in fact that's pretty much how we

434
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,080
do it in practice because we we don't

435
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,280
assume

436
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,620
uh that we know the uh complete

437
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,200
distribution we update priors in each of

438
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,299
these cases because we have

439
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,260
yeah

440
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,120
uh

441
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,980
coming back to your point that the a

442
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,320
matrix does address this the a matrix

443
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,740
would be something that would you said

444
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,919
it would denoise and filter out some

445
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,240
stray observations but okay so our so

446
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,360
the the question Still Remains is when

447
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,240
you're saying prediction is a prediction

448
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,120
of the signal over here

449
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,760
as in what is the future state of the

450
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,720
sensor

451
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,900
but I think there it seems seemed to

452
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,240
indicate that the prediction relates to

453
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,039
relates to the free energy minimization

454
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,100
itself right so you choose policies that

455
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,140
would minimize your free energy and keep

456
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,299
yourself into some set point

457
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,940
so which means that there should be some

458
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,500
sort of uh

459
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,679
an idea of what ranges are there for

460
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,120
this value or uh how far can these go

461
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320
before

462
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,940
you know you're not in that set point

463
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,960
anymore

464
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,820
so even if you if you do want to make

465
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,919
that prediction it's a it's not just the

466
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,679
signal value so signal values

467
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,880
effectively through the Marco blanket

468
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,700
they affect some internal State and

469
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,280
we're that's what I I'm assuming that's

470
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,480
what we're trying to predict the

471
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,559
trajectory of the future internal States

472
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,740
actually the expectation that's being

473
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,140
um yeah minimized is over outcome

474
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,080
observations not about internal States

475
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,860
oh okay yeah yeah I'm sorry so uh yeah

476
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,179
so even then we we don't have so the

477
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,640
signals may have well-defined precision

478
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,140
and bias but

479
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,360
the entire system itself doesn't have

480
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,980
any sort of

481
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,840
uh

482
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,700
well it doesn't know how wrong it could

483
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,840
go

484
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,360
it doesn't have any error estimate so

485
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,400
that it's it there's no noise model as

486
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
such so we can't apply any so we would

487
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,919
have to assume that there is some

488
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,900
distribution of states and then use

489
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,120
something like least squares or some

490
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,700
other uh optimization routine to

491
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,919
actually bring this in practice

492
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,260
great totally possible um it would be

493
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,900
interesting to sketch out a Bayes graph

494
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,360
for what you believe a signal to noise

495
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,539
or some type of noise model would embody

496
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,080
and maybe we will see some analogies or

497
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,340
some mappings

498
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,600
um Jessica and then Brock

499
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,919
hi yes I'm I mean I think

500
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,100
I both you and Rohan like in the new

501
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,720
Province but

502
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,000
I was going to say that um

503
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,059
would be like the filtering and like a

504
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,860
lot of like the biases and things like

505
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,020
that kind of like made sense of it is

506
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,220
like

507
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,980
I see the because I think it was like

508
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,299
chapter two or something like that I

509
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,780
said like right like so the why is

510
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,900
this you know quote-unquote

511
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,500
um you know uh like a fat thing like you

512
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
know that we can observe from the hidden

513
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,580
state or like the process of something

514
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,179
that we don't know and so for everybody

515
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,780
like we can see the same thing but how

516
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,360
we process it internally is going to

517
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,460
vary like it's gonna be very subjective

518
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,100
so the why is gonna look different for

519
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,559
Daniel then it's gonna look for me based

520
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,200
on all this filtering and so the black

521
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,520
Estates

522
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,620
I imagine sort of like one half like

523
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,159
those filters that encode the biases and

524
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,559
all the things that allow us to

525
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,620
process things differently and and so

526
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,900
like then I generated model

527
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,820
and it would like it's gonna be updated

528
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,919
like differently all right also like

529
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,659
encoded I think in the general model

530
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,000
would be a lot of uh like you reset and

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,100
things like that that embody I think

532
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,320
probably like a lot of biases and like

533
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,080
things of how we understand things which

534
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,820
also influence how we

535
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,940
interpret what we observe

536
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,039
and so for so for me it's like a lot of

537
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,480
these things are there like in terms of

538
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,900
like statistics I don't know um much but

539
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,779
that's how like I you know conceptually

540
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,600
I um

541
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,120
but like you know understood like a lot

542
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,799
of these things so like basically like

543
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,299
in the blanket stage of the Marco

544
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,500
blanket

545
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,059
it would have a ladder like this

546
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,820
filtering you know and

547
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,740
yes like

548
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,100
um like if you're going to try to you

549
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,720
know let's say Like You observe

550
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,480
something that's different than what you

551
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,799
predicted in your model then you would

552
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,559
take action and to forage and like find

553
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,539
information

554
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,419
and to figure it out okay like what am I

555
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,419
missing like why did I make this mistake

556
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,159
or like this error I in my prediction

557
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,539
and so that I can like have more

558
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,460
information and update the model so that

559
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,860
it aligns more closely so then you would

560
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,159
basically take action to the noise and

561
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,700
basically get closer to

562
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,340
um like quote unquote the reality that's

563
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,419
out there

564
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,419
that yeah I don't know if it's official

565
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,220
lighting but that's how like it kind of

566
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,539
makes sense to me

567
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,039
thanks Jessica Brock

568
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,960
um yeah I just

569
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,880
uh

570
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,380
wanted to I guess speak to this like

571
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:09,360
uh sensor noise model I don't like in

572
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,940
practice in reality like when you're

573
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,320
talking about sensors like in a physical

574
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,679
system like like a digital signal

575
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,440
processing kind of context like

576
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,779
the sensors are tested under some

577
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:25,080
conditions for things like you know

578
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,120
Jitter and

579
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,960
um spurious kind of uh noise conditions

580
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,820
and stuff like that but they're tested

581
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,700
under some conditions

582
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,140
meaning that there's never ever going to

583
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,240
be a time when you have an actual model

584
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,919
you're just going to have an

585
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,080
approximation whether that's expressed

586
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,779
in a frequentis or Bayesian

587
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:52,620
um

588
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,500
way like there's going to be some

589
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,020
uncertainty in the model

590
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,659
and especially if you start connecting

591
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,279
it up to

592
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,860
a larger system

593
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,340
um doing the same kind of like is the

594
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,000
Jitter in that sensor the same when you

595
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,460
know when it's completely isolated as it

596
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,240
is when it's on a you know six by nine

597
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,299
PCB board with you know

598
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:22,080
um

599
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,620
12 volts on one side and a oscillator

600
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,620
next to that that's you know like

601
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,860
are those now is it the same thing you

602
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,640
know

603
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,260
um you have to do these sort of

604
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,480
electromagnetic compatibility you know

605
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,460
resonance sort of testing on it like

606
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,240
there's just that it's it's uh in

607
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
practice it's Bayesian like you're doing

608
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
the same sort of

609
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,500
um bounding and you know belief

610
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,559
um testing and you know Finding Your

611
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,020
errors and correcting them

612
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,880
um even in practice

613
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,200
[Music]

614
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
um

615
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,880
I don't see how you could possibly have

616
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,760
like even like physically a system like

617
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,279
that could exist where you had a noise

618
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,559
model that you could write down that was

619
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,659
actually the noise model

620
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,340
um under all conditions or

621
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,100
yeah it's um

622
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,200
it doesn't seem like a

623
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,659
approachable I don't know it's not even

624
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,520
not tractable

625
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,539
which is the wrong thing to do I don't

626
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,760
thanks Brock

627
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,700
um in the case of engineering and

628
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,700
designing models it's up to the designer

629
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,580
or the engineering team to understand

630
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,500
like what is adequate or not and for

631
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,480
natural systems

632
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
outside of their bounds

633
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,260
natural selection sweeps them off the

634
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,980
table

635
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,460
so some of the adequacy questions are

636
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,520
either based upon

637
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,140
specified or implicit human standards or

638
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,539
the failure to resist

639
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,919
dissipation

640
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,020
and therefore the failure to realize

641
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,700
repeated measurements

642
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,640
of oneself or from the external

643
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,820
and then that system is no longer

644
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,919
let's just continue to move through some

645
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
of the questions

646
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,080
um yes go for it

647
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,559
uh yeah I I completely agree with what

648
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,760
Brock said right but my my point was

649
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,399
when when you say that you're predicting

650
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,380
something it means that

651
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,860
uh you either know the quantity that

652
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,960
you're trying to predict

653
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,860
and or and it corresponds to so in this

654
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,799
case like some action results in some

655
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,260
reward I guess you could predict the

656
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,299
reward but without knowing how wrong

657
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,220
you're going to be in the future

658
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,480
so

659
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,360
where exactly immigrant is so that any

660
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,279
living system would have to have be

661
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,620
aware of its own bounds right that's

662
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,039
that's what I meant by noise models so

663
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,020
it has to know that it has to stay

664
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,419
within some bounds and as it starts

665
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,299
coming closer to one of the upper lower

666
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,220
bounds there should be some something

667
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,580
like pulling it back down

668
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,460
or some feedback mechanism but that is

669
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,100
not very clear from the from what I've

670
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,020
read so far on active inference system

671
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,700
what

672
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,039
how exactly it would estimate that is

673
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,659
you can just save free energy

674
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,520
minimization

675
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
uh but what is a minimum in this case

676
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,140
that would be different for different

677
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,240
systems so it should have some idea of

678
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,100
where the surfaces of whichever local

679
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
surface it's lying on that that was my

680
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,399
point

681
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,960
so for sure it's different for different

682
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,179
systems it's different as every single

683
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,760
generative model is

684
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,620
um and then you mentioned like

685
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,260
um a pullback attractor and so this has

686
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,960
been treated extensively in the context

687
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,179
of physiological measurements and then

688
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,919
again wear those priors on the

689
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,480
physiological measurements are the

690
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,299
tolerable range are either provided by

691
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,179
the human engineering team or through

692
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,299
evolution by natural selection and then

693
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,039
um yeah

694
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,460
the quantity like another related topic

695
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,279
would be expectation maximization models

696
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,500
which is what is happening essentially

697
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,860
in the dialectic between the observation

698
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,320
and the hidden State update

699
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,480
is an expectation maximization like

700
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,760
process where it's like given the hyper

701
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,899
priors

702
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,640
or we can just simplify just given the

703
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,700
priors on S what are the most likely or

704
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,340
the distribution of observables and then

705
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,860
given the observables what should be

706
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,860
updated about the hidden State priors

707
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,679
and when those are at conversions the

708
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,320
model is stationary and then as things

709
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,899
change either from the top via learning

710
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,480
or context shift or through changed

711
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,100
measurements

712
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,159
the expectation maximization algorithm

713
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,980
is just able to track those changes and

714
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,399
that can in the context of a fixed prior

715
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,360
have the function of a pullback

716
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,840
attractor

717
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,100
um okay and that's even before getting

718
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,919
into action specifically but yes

719
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,019
definitely considering like the role of

720
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:25,080
comparing future plans of action

721
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,539
and which plans of actions will have the

722
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,299
least expected free energy based upon

723
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,340
their

724
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,100
um pragmatic and epistemic value like

725
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,860
which the epistemic just being Clarity

726
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,600
around how it's going to be achieved and

727
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,279
the pragmatic value being that KL

728
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,500
Divergence between the expectations

729
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,140
preferences and the expected

730
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,279
observations

731
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,380
so if we expect slash prefer to be in

732
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,120
homeostasis

733
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,120
the pragmatic value is going to come or

734
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,820
be loaded onto policies that keep us in

735
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,159
homeostasis even if some other one is

736
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,659
super informative

737
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,820
how that model gets tuned is quite

738
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,440
literally the details of how the model

739
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,460
is

740
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,640
trained right my point was that active

741
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,260
inference doesn't help us find this we

742
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,240
have to find this ourselves and then

743
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,340
hopefully once we have instantiated

744
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,080
these bounds I think active inference

745
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,960
works very well to keep it within this

746
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,779
right if you can't discover this you

747
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,679
know right like I can't have like a uh

748
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,539
what you'd say double or rasa type

749
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,640
system like a blank slave system God in

750
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,559
the world and discover your bounds

751
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,080
that's not going to happen but this kind

752
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,779
of method is what what I was uh making

753
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,480
it out whereas

754
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,580
taking some something equivalent without

755
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,600
any so deep learning is another

756
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,059
uh method right so you just feed it a

757
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,380
lot of data it doesn't have to know

758
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,940
anything about the data eventually it

759
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,919
forms some opinion about the data it's

760
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,360
seen and then it's able to do some

761
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,700
classification or depending on how much

762
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,860
data it's seen so it's able to build

763
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,700
certain amount of bounds whether that's

764
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,960
generalizable is a different question

765
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,980
but

766
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,519
uh here there's the learning part

767
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,340
does not say much about how exactly it

768
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,799
goes about discovering

769
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,779
where its limits are that that's my

770
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:16,500
point

771
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,120
sure thank you

772
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,479
um Eric

773
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,760
um you know I would I would love to to

774
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,700
dive this a little bit more into

775
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,140
um the thing you were just talking about

776
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,279
how expectation maximization might is a

777
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,620
is a mathematical

778
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,059
formulation for how to infer belief

779
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,620
States from observations because you uh

780
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,960
basically go through this iterative

781
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,120
process of trying to find alignment

782
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,460
between the states of the belief and the

783
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,140
observables and then you can track that

784
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,279
over time

785
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,640
between that concept and the concept of

786
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,140
message passing

787
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,120
when I think of message passing I think

788
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,519
of some sort of a distributed system

789
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,320
where you have some local computation

790
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
and it sends you know and you have again

791
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,119
either synchronous or Acres asynchronous

792
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,619
process for

793
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,280
communicating between these kind of

794
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,960
different centers of

795
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,480
cut of belief state

796
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,239
and then again through message passing

797
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,339
you have often an iterative process of

798
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:24,540
convergence

799
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,418
so um those are not the same thing and I

800
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,760
think you know message passing to my

801
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,480
understanding would be an em algorithm

802
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,339
under certain types of messages and

803
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,960
States at each of the nodes that you're

804
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,659
sending the messages around but not all

805
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,359
message passing is going to be any em

806
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,520
algorithm and similarly when I think of

807
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,379
em I don't think about message passing I

808
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,260
think about making an arrays of you know

809
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,760
of um

810
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,399
belief and matrices between you know

811
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,379
mapping between belief and observations

812
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,180
and then

813
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,420
um trying to compute an expectation for

814
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,460
you know for for what my predictions

815
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,500
would be and then making this iterative

816
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,760
conversion so I don't think of that in

817
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,560
terms of message passing so I'd like to

818
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,180
I just love to hear other people's ideas

819
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,460
about how to tie these two

820
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,680
um ideas together

821
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,060
yeah

822
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,980
um Brock

823
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,160
if your hand is still raced or

824
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,660
okay nope so sorry yeah okay all good

825
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,779
um

826
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,480
does anyone have thoughts on this

827
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,540
there's a lot to say about the uh

828
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,720
expectation maximization algorithms and

829
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,099
like just to kind of give a little

830
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,339
context this is the step-by-step

831
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,720
um paper

832
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,619
so this is the model stream one it's

833
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,359
four parts

834
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,820
um and this is like really a quite

835
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,560
relevant figure which is not in the

836
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,460
textbook

837
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,000
but helps a lot like this is the essence

838
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,300
of the partially observable Bayesian

839
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,119
inference there's a prior D and then

840
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,300
there's an a ambiguity Matrix that is

841
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,119
mapping in a generative capacity between

842
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,859
hidden States s and observation

843
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,200
measurements o this is The Tail of Two

844
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,440
densities because o

845
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,280
through a can give you the most likely s

846
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,520
an S through a can give you the most

847
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,839
likely o

848
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,540
and it turns out that by alternating

849
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,400
those procedures

850
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,119
in a Bayesian update context

851
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,160
that two-stroke engine is called

852
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,940
expectation maximization again because

853
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,440
given expectations on the summary

854
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,660
statistics of a distribution the

855
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,579
expected sensory observations can be

856
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,820
generated and then given those

857
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,760
observations a likelihood function can

858
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,760
be maximized that then updates the

859
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,940
hidden States so this Motif this kind of

860
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,560
elbow motif

861
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,460
is then extended into a caterpillar with

862
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,720
this B

863
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,579
which is how the hidden State changes

864
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,540
their time

865
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,700
so importantly like note what's not

866
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,560
there which is like the observations

867
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,960
being chained Through Time

868
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,460
so it's not that the temperature reading

869
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,960
at one moment influences the temperature

870
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,700
reading at the next moment the

871
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,380
temperature readings are continually

872
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,880
linked

873
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,200
um synchronously like in one time slice

874
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,420
to their hidden States

875
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,359
so then when action gets into the

876
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,079
picture

877
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,940
we've talked about like several sources

878
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,920
that's like the equation 2.5 to equation

879
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,460
2.6 phase change because action brings

880
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,099
in several kinds of uncertainty first

881
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,320
off you're reducing your uncertainty

882
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,359
about observations which haven't

883
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,980
happened yet

884
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,500
you're also having the unknown

885
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,839
consequences of your actions

886
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,000
and in order to have action selection

887
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,640
that's relevance one has to have a

888
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,680
preference distribution

889
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,260
over what kinds of observations they

890
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,820
would like to be seeing so that action

891
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,640
can guide it in that direction

892
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,380
okay

893
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,560
um then so that's the the expectation

894
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,200
maximization two-stroke engine

895
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,700
is basically graphically

896
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,520
um proposed here D is just the

897
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,160
initiating set of parameters

898
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,619
and then in a One-Shot way like you can

899
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,540
have a a folder with a thousand images

900
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,599
and do expectation maximization on it

901
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,400
or you could have something that's

902
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
dynamical and do that type of

903
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,950
expectation maximization Through Time

904
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,320
[Music]

905
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
um

906
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,339
Eric asked how is it related to

907
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,380
message passing

908
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,040
on graphs so I'm not familiar with all

909
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,400
the details of this model but you

910
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,460
basically said it which was that like

911
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,460
certain message passing systems

912
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,500
Implement em

913
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,540
but of course not all message patching

914
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,460
architectures Implement DM so message

915
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,020
passing is more General than em also em

916
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,420
wouldn't have to be implemented through

917
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,280
message passing so there's kind of but

918
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,220
there's like an area of intersection

919
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,180
where the EM algorithm can be seen as a

920
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,460
type of message passing

921
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,839
under certain compute rules in a factor

922
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,160
graph

923
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,099
and EM at least from here may be used to

924
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,599
break Cycles in a factor graph

925
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,740
so it's always like

926
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,099
how close to the kernel and like the

927
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,320
platonic ideal of active inference are

928
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,520
we talking

929
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,119
and then how many heuristics

930
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,339
and just

931
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,640
ways of connecting things are possible

932
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,480
so I

933
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,618
I will now read the chat

934
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,000
that's from previous context okay okay

935
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,099
thank you

936
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,780
um

937
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,720
like the statistical parametric mapping

938
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,079
textbook and documentation SPM

939
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,960
has a lot on em

940
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,000
variational inference

941
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,339
and a lot of the parts that bring one

942
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,099
to understand this

943
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,579
a lot better SPM is like almost like it

944
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,460
doesn't include action that much because

945
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,500
it's a neuroimaging so the observations

946
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,200
are neuroimaging Sensor Fusion different

947
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,760
error modalities like the whole panopoly

948
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,859
and then SPM started to incorporate

949
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:54,480
participant actions

950
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,599
in this partially observable metabasian

951
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,040
way and potentially that is what led

952
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,680
Tristan colleagues towards a grander

953
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,880
synthesis of inference and action

954
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
under a statistically principled

955
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,000
framework

956
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,339
let's just see if there's any other

957
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,619
these are all you know

958
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,300
important questions and like there's a

959
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,680
lot to get up to them and then there's

960
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,200
like a lot to go from the question but

961
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,319
these are all important things to raise

962
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,220
okay

963
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,700
[Music]

964
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
um

965
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
if anyone has a thought on this how

966
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,720
should we think about redundancy in

967
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,460
neural systems in the context of active

968
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,780
inference

969
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,760
so redundancy would be like if there's

970
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,900
something that's playing a functional

971
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,480
role but it's removal

972
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,140
is not damaging the function of the

973
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,079
system yeah there's 10 pillars knocking

974
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,780
out one of them the building stays up

975
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,000
so there's redundancy in the pillars

976
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,500
what about the cases where the same

977
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,700
neural circuits serves multiple

978
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,920
functions

979
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,260
so how do we deal with the fact that

980
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,880
there's like a many-to-many potentially

981
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,700
or a complex mapping between system

982
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,300
elements and system functions

983
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,280
where sometimes removing Node 1 does

984
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,680
nothing but removing node one and two

985
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,119
there's a lot of things but then

986
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,619
removing one two and three and it's

987
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:23,480
going back to being fine Jessica

988
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,599
and maybe like ask blue about it because

989
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,339
this is what I feel but

990
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:35,760
it this question made me think about

991
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,560
like it's not only like that the brain

992
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,619
has like this redundancy things but

993
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,380
it like would like to say like if you

994
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,060
have some kind of damage to your brain

995
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,460
like another part of your brain that

996
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,380
maybe you was not

997
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,020
use for something would develop that

998
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,339
capacity

999
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,040
and so it would create that you know

1000
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,540
ability

1001
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,200
and so neuroplasticity like

1002
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,420
brand new even though it was not a

1003
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,119
redundancy to begin with so I guess I'm

1004
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,760
more Curious to understand this and so

1005
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,220
other people who know more like blue and

1006
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,480
stuff um

1007
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,540
about this and basically that's kind of

1008
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,000
what this question made me think about

1009
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,440
and kind of wanting to understand more

1010
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,780
that's good question yeah blue wrote

1011
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,900
depends on your age yeah like difference

1012
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,800
neuroplasticity mechanisms are

1013
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,560
differentially available throughout life

1014
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,740
for different organisms

1015
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,400
um

1016
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,520
Just one thought on this would be like

1017
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,380
the same neural circuit serving multiple

1018
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,200
functions might be totally the case for

1019
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,160
example

1020
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,400
um and one like is the function of a

1021
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,099
heart to provide one pound of weight to

1022
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,859
the Torso it is a function of the heart

1023
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:55,980
is at one you know so identifying what

1024
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,260
function is being modeled is what's

1025
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,060
being done here so let's just go to like

1026
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,280
the example of figure five three

1027
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,960
this

1028
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,300
neuron

1029
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,339
modifying it like a loss of function

1030
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:11,819
experiments or having it injured might

1031
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:15,060
influence more things than just

1032
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,220
the lower motor neuron descending

1033
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,000
message

1034
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
so that'd be a case where like it serves

1035
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,200
multiple functions

1036
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,259
um

1037
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,280
this is just one statistical model

1038
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,020
of

1039
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,960
this function of this circuit

1040
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,140
and that returns to to the earliest

1041
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,380
comments of Eric with like okay this is

1042
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,500
like tantalizingly seeming like it's

1043
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,119
actually going to be describing the

1044
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,640
neural Anatomy but then they say things

1045
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,960
like note the absence of dot dot dot dot

1046
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,520
note that there's a discrepancy between

1047
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,140
for example

1048
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,119
the reality of the anatomy

1049
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,700
and the base graph

1050
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,020
this highlights that the connections

1051
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,880
implied by message passing schemes may

1052
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,560
not manifest as single synapses

1053
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,359
so

1054
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,859
okay

1055
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,240
there's kind of false positives and

1056
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,940
false negatives the Bayes graph isn't

1057
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,800
just the anatomy

1058
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,720
that's fine

1059
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
the linear regression between height and

1060
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,720
weight isn't the actual relationship

1061
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,760
between height and weight and the

1062
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,400
structural equation model of

1063
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,520
inequality is not the generator of

1064
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,780
inequality

1065
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,599
so it's totally fair and shouldn't be

1066
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,420
expected to be otherwise that the base

1067
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,819
graph the best fitting base graph the

1068
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,500
most didactic phase graph the simplest

1069
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,700
phase graph

1070
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,160
none of those recapitulate the anatomy

1071
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,079
and the base graph that recapitulates

1072
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,960
the anatomy would not necessarily even

1073
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,000
be the best fitting

1074
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,980
its map and territory

1075
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,980
and if somebody has a a special equation

1076
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,839
to break through that

1077
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,400
blanket

1078
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,740
everybody would love to see it

1079
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,359
however

1080
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,960
sometimes it's easy to gloss over

1081
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,520
that

1082
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,160
in principle challenge

1083
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,560
of mapping formalisms to biological

1084
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,920
systems because we see the cell and then

1085
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,599
the blanket is the membrane and we see

1086
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,339
the brain and it's like vision and

1087
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:24,420
action and it seems like it maps on to

1088
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,640
the physical or the anatomical structure

1089
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,440
of the world or the causal structure of

1090
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,819
the world

1091
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:31,920
and um

1092
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,859
it doesn't

1093
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,720
so I hope people can add more thoughts

1094
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,819
about like how we consider redundancy

1095
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,020
because it's a great

1096
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,420
question

1097
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,540
um

1098
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,720
but we'll leave it there

1099
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,859
um how are

1100
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:53,160
reflexes modeled in active inference

1101
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,839
would they exist in an active inference

1102
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,160
module that is distinct from

1103
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,619
proprioception but they operate on

1104
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,079
different time scales

1105
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,880
um if anybody wants to add like some

1106
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,740
some context on it

1107
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,799
um

1108
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,980
a reflex arc

1109
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,440
relating to

1110
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,819
um where reflex is defined as

1111
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,819
um a function that is being relayed

1112
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,980
through the spinal cord of a mammal

1113
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,440
and not passing like you could have a

1114
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,319
nerve block in the cervical vertebra and

1115
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,420
it still is able to like Implement like

1116
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,400
that's one definition of reflex

1117
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,680
often it's also used slightly more

1118
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,720
broadly to mean like

1119
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,660
um stimulus action reproducible outcomes

1120
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,940
but not every reflex has a perfect

1121
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,339
reproducibility et cetera et cetera so

1122
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,079
it's kind of a Continuum

1123
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,200
um yes it would involve proprioceptive

1124
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,359
input

1125
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,059
that proprioceptive input

1126
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:03,540
would be combined or

1127
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,300
um

1128
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,319
juxtaposed with the descending

1129
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,300
prediction

1130
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,119
resulting in an error

1131
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,339
and then that directionality and

1132
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:15,780
magnitude of the error in this model

1133
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,500
drives the reflex

1134
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,660
there can also be multiple time scales

1135
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,300
but we haven't seen any nested modeling

1136
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,800
yet

1137
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,440
this is just the one layer model

1138
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,700
the schematic on the left in figure five

1139
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,540
one

1140
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,420
shows that layer 5 of Cortex projects to

1141
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,400
spinal pyramidal neurons and this can be

1142
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,780
interpreted as a prediction

1143
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,480
okay so this is this one

1144
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,599
um

1145
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,339
okay helpful um context

1146
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:59,280
and and it um relates to this earlier

1147
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,380
highlighted section

1148
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,280
which is like

1149
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,660
it's the interpretation

1150
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,579
the interpretive link

1151
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:13,079
between some anatomical or biological

1152
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,000
feature phenotype

1153
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,960
and some parametric

1154
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,220
resonance with a model

1155
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,760
the validity of that ranges from

1156
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,200
pretty clear

1157
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,359
pretty uncontroversial pretty useful

1158
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:33,180
pretty effective

1159
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,619
to

1160
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,319
none of the above

1161
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,859
and it's hard to know like what given

1162
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,200
interpretive links

1163
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,240
are doing

1164
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,640
like saying that this Edge on this base

1165
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,220
graph can be interpreted as a descending

1166
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,720
excitatory connection

1167
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,839
or that might be used to generate

1168
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:58,140
specific testable hypotheses like if we

1169
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,540
measure it during a period of excitation

1170
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,520
the activity of this neuron we expect it

1171
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,740
to be increased whereas if it was a

1172
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,140
descending inhibitory connection

1173
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,339
Etc

1174
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,180
um

1175
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,420
that's a great example of active

1176
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,660
inference being used in a proactive way

1177
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,520
to generate hypotheses about biological

1178
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,579
systems that are going to be as they

1179
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:23,220
said in the preface

1180
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:23,520
[Music]

1181
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,079
um

1182
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,180
answerable to measured data

1183
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,339
by grounding in

1184
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,319
the computational model

1185
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,599
that is related to the neural Anatomy

1186
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:37,920
but isn't trying to be like a digital

1187
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,900
twin of the neuroanatomy

1188
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,480
we can generate predictions about gain

1189
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,220
loss of function different measurements

1190
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,500
to make if they don't already exist

1191
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,780
and then that can be used to increase

1192
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,740
our confidence or reliability or falsify

1193
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,800
even a specific generative model as

1194
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,319
proposed

1195
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,220
so there's so much discourse like

1196
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,140
continuing to the present day and surely

1197
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,420
Beyond as like all these questions and

1198
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,700
recently posted in the Discord about

1199
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,619
like

1200
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,059
active inference or free energy

1201
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,880
principle isn't falsifiable

1202
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,520
now the funny link is it's not

1203
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,420
falsifiable so it's been falsified

1204
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,400
it can't be falsified

1205
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,079
so it's incorrect

1206
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,640
that's an interesting connection that

1207
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,619
some people make but a linear model

1208
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,900
cannot be falsified a base graph cannot

1209
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,020
be falsified once any given linear model

1210
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,579
is presented

1211
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,460
in a context with constraints for a

1212
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,660
certain data type

1213
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,359
then it's an empirical question of its

1214
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,760
accuracy and adequacy relative to other

1215
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,040
models

1216
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,200
but at the abstract level of a neural

1217
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,359
network or linear model or active

1218
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,500
inference

1219
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,359
falsification

1220
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,500
simply doesn't apply

1221
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,700
but there's a lot that could be

1222
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,800
clarified

1223
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,760
um

1224
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,880
about like what are the utilities and

1225
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,380
some of the pitfalls

1226
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,640
of mapping

1227
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,280
biological or cyber physical systems to

1228
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,040
active inference models

1229
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,960
if it's a purely digital system or

1230
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,640
potentially even a cyber physical system

1231
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,200
that's been designed a really certain

1232
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,460
way

1233
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,940
it might be compatible with actinth

1234
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,500
like essentially by Fiat or by Design

1235
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,480
one could make an artificial creature

1236
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,400
like an infra ant

1237
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,240
that is implementing active inference

1238
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,720
one could also model an ant in the field

1239
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,319
using a linear model or a levy flight or

1240
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,180
some other model or an active inference

1241
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,859
model

1242
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:54,059
but those are two very different

1243
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:56,460
settings one in which sort of the rabbit

1244
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,380
was placed into the Hat

1245
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,540
and then we have a rabbit analyzer

1246
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,819
and the other one being like

1247
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,980
we don't know what's in the Hat but we

1248
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,900
have a rapid analyzer that we think

1249
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,099
applies to what is in this hat

1250
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,380
um

1251
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,680
chapter five includes some

1252
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,839
um evidence presented on different

1253
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,280
neurotransmitters so

1254
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,859
um it'd be interesting to see like

1255
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,380
what other Frameworks

1256
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,260
are able to be compatible

1257
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,059
or even provide unique explanations

1258
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:41,220
predictions Etc

1259
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,160
related to neurochemistry

1260
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,839
have neural networks ever been used to

1261
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,300
derive unique predictions or found

1262
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,579
compatibility with neural hormones

1263
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,579
neurochemicals

1264
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:54,480
um

1265
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,700
and then again they have a final figure

1266
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,980
in chapter five that's like a graphical

1267
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,960
overview of several of the systems that

1268
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,880
are described in the chapter

1269
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,740
specifically relating to like the

1270
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,660
cortical

1271
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,819
cognitive functions

1272
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:10,619
and then

1273
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:14,760
the dialectic between habit and

1274
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,400
free energy driven planning

1275
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,720
here

1276
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,640
with dopamine as a Precision modulator

1277
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,460
with like extensive further modeling

1278
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,119
presented in other papers and this like

1279
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,220
even more basal

1280
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,460
motor selection mechanism based upon

1281
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,760
reflex arcs and proprioceptive error

1282
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,079
minimization

1283
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,040
and all of that

1284
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,079
um

1285
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,799
we raise these questions not to offer

1286
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:45,119
any answers but to highlight some of the

1287
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,400
exciting Avenues of future research and

1288
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,319
theoretical neurobiology

1289
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,920
so a lot of the questions that are asked

1290
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,599
um

1291
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:58,559
here in this paragraph but also above at

1292
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,880
the very beginning they said we're not

1293
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,200
saying how it is we're just giving like

1294
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,940
the current process model understanding

1295
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,940
and then especially at the end

1296
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,040
they raise even more speculative

1297
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,119
questions

1298
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,160
so

1299
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,859
um that takes us to the end of chapter

1300
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,660
five

1301
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,760
that's the first half of the book that's

1302
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,839
the uh epistemic component of the book

1303
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,260
well a lot of it is epistemic but that's

1304
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,900
the first five chapters

1305
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,280
um

1306
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,000
the second five chapters

1307
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,640
which are longer

1308
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,559
partially because of having more figures

1309
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,240
and things like that but you can see

1310
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,520
there's more pages

1311
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,140
um slightly in the second

1312
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,540
part of the book though we've also read

1313
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,040
the um

1314
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,960
at least some of the appendices

1315
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,000
that's where we're heading which is

1316
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,640
picking up on uh

1317
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,240
chapter six in just a few weeks with a

1318
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,859
recipe for Designing active Emperors

1319
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,460
models so for those who stuck with the

1320
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,380
uncertainty

1321
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,900
for the first five chapters and stay in

1322
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,760
the game

1323
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,740
more will become clear when the recipe

1324
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,980
for the dish is seen and then more will

1325
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,299
be

1326
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:21,480
clarified when the dish is prepared and

1327
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,920
then when

1328
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,960
you cut the vegetables and then when you

1329
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,299
design the dish in the recipe and all of

1330
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:29,099
that and that's like a journey that

1331
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,440
we're all going to be on the tools are

1332
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,180
not finalized in the kitchen is not

1333
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,380
completed Etc et cetera et cetera so

1334
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,960
it's just a call for us to go to

1335
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,720
onboarding

1336
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,480
and indicate our interest in continuing

1337
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,000
with one or the other uh cohort

1338
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,240
or sharing with any colleagues who you

1339
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,160
think might like to jump in to the

1340
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,200
second cohort of part one

1341
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,740
and then in the coming two weeks

1342
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,920
we'll be able to take a step back

1343
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,380
look over the chapter questions but also

1344
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,359
think about more general questions that

1345
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:08,660
we're having basic questions

1346
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,640
miso questions Advanced questions

1347
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,059
research Avenues and also turn to the

1348
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:16,799
project ideas

1349
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,260
where multiple of these are already

1350
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,440
active and there's spaces for people who

1351
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,760
want to

1352
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,880
facilitate or catalyze some other

1353
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,500
direction

1354
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,720
so

1355
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,160
fun meeting

1356
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,400
