For people who want to continue in the textbook group, go to the onboarding page. Starting in September, we'll be getting more hands on with modeling.	We are now in chapter five of the active textbook group first cohort	Active Textbook Group
303170	971928	05:03	 Chapter Five sets out the process theory associated with active inference. It seems to me that many, many papers trying to map theories onto brain circuitry and physiology. It's all quite hand wavy, I find, and I guess plausible, but it's certainly not definitive.	Chapter Five moves from formal treatments to biological implications of active inference	Applying Active Inference to the Brain

The question still remains is when you're saying prediction, is it prediction of the signal over here?	So you mentioned about the bias related to measurements. Then you mentioned when talking about returns on stocks	Bayesian statistics

How we process it internally is going be very subjective. In the blanket days of the Marco blanket, it would have a lot of disfaltering.	Jessica and then Brock. Hi. Thanks for joining us	Neuroscience: The Why of Probability
1496280	1818120	24:56	In practice it's Bayesian like you're doing the same sort of bounding and belief testing and finding your errors and correcting them. Any living system would have to be aware of its own bounds. For natural systems outside of their bounds, natural selection sweeps them off the table.	Rohan: I wanted to speak to this sensor noise model in practice	Bayesian inference on sensor noise
1818640	1998900	30:18	Another related topic would be expectation maximization models. How that model gets tuned is quite literally the details of how the model is trained. We have to find this ourselves. Once we have instantiated these bounds, I think active inference works very well to keep it within this.	Another related topic would be expectation maximization models	Expectation Maximization Algorithms
2002280	2123470	33:22	Expectation maximization is a mathematical formulation for how to infer belief states from observations. Through message passing, you have often an iterative process of convergence. So I just love to hear other people's ideas about how to tie these two ideas together.	Brock: Expectation maximization is a mathematical formulation for infer belief from observations	Expected-maximization and message passing
2126800	2494762	35:26	The expectation maximization two stroke engine is basically graphically proposed. Eric asked how is it related to message passing on graphs. How close to the kernel and the Platonic ideal of active inference are we talking? And then how many heuristics and ways of connecting things are possible.	The expectation maximization algorithm is based on partially observable Bayesian inference	Expectation maximization 2-step engine
2494816	2806020	41:34	How should we think about redundancy in neural systems in the context of active inference? What about the cases where the same neural circuits serve multiple functions?	How should we think about redundancy in neural systems in the context of active inference	Bayes and Sequential redundancy in neural systems
2808310	3471400	46:48	How are reflexes modeled in active inference? Would they exist in an active inference module that is distinct from proprioception. Would they operate on different timescales? There's a lot that could be clarified about what are the utilities and pitfalls of mapping biological or cyberphysical systems to active inference models.	How are reflexes modeled in active inference? Would they exist in an active	Active Inference 6, Proprioception
