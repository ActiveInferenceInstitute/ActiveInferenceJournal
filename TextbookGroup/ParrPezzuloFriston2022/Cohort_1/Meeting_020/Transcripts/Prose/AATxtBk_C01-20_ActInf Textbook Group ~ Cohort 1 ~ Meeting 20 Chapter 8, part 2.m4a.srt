00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,442
You. Hello everyone. It's october 14,

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:14,294
2022. We're in meeting

3
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:16,986
20. We're in our second discussion of

4
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:20,774
chapter eight. We have a few topics

5
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:24,090
and points in chapter eight and then

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,050
maybe we can preview some

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,458
chapter nine and have a lot of

8
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,146
space for any other foster questions

9
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:38,046
people are having so we can jump

10
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:43,954
to the questions and look at the written

11
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,550
chapter eight questions. Or does anyone

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,846
want to suggest a point for us

13
00:00:49,868 --> 00:01:00,612
to go to last

14
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,476
time? We know that some of the areas we

15
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:06,960
wanted to pick up on involved

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,976
learning and hierarchical modeling and

17
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,400
hybrid modeling.

18
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,312
One question that came up, I think here,

19
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:43,360
but maybe we can revisit is the birdsong

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,944
model is widely

21
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,412
pointed at as an example of how

22
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,448
communication is modeled in active

23
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:54,028
inference or for active inference

24
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:57,252
entities. However, it's quite literally

25
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:59,624
singing from the same hymn sheet. And

26
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:03,592
the turn taking is based upon a

27
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:07,848
joint expectation of that song

28
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,870
being sung that way.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,564
And then the actions that the birds can

30
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:16,748
take, the kind of turn taking that they

31
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:21,308
enact is again

32
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:22,944
related to whether it's like, well,

33
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,544
somebody has to say it is it going to be

34
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:27,296
me or is it going to be them? So how do

35
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,800
you think we would broaden that scope

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,108
of communication to account for

37
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:38,804
situations where there

38
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:41,540
isn't a prescripted song?

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,176
How do other frameworks for

40
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:51,268
communication cybernetic

41
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:54,970
ish or otherwise deal with

42
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,800
the semantics of conversation,

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,140
improvisation,

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,660
open endedness in conversation?

45
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,694
Actually, I had somewhat

46
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:19,846
more general question about the bird

47
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,898
songs and its relation to these

48
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,026
particular systems that they've

49
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:29,600
developed in the textbook. You see,

50
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,518
some researchers believe that I'm sure

51
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:36,894
you're much qualified to

52
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:41,218
talk about this than me, but there

53
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:44,820
are lots of research going around about

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,330
the territorialization function of

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,966
birdsong. So if

56
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:59,142
we take a bird song as its

57
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,230
territorializing mechanism,

58
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,654
at least one of its territorializing

59
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:10,330
mechanism, can we somehow

60
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,158
put the dynamic I mean,

61
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:17,626
the dynamic boundary of the markup

62
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:22,462
blanket, I think would be affected from

63
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:26,366
this point of view. And then I'm not

64
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:28,802
sure how that would translate into this

65
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:33,374
specific model if we take that dynamic

66
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,810
nature of the markup blanket boundary.

67
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,714
Yeah, I guess I would just build on that

68
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:47,286
and say that communication serves a

69
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:51,014
purpose. And so I think a

70
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:53,334
model should incorporate what that

71
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:56,426
purpose is and how it's served by the

72
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:57,866
communication. And then whether it

73
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:00,826
happens to be syncing up with some

74
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:04,346
predefined pattern or whatever is a

75
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:06,250
follow on consideration.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,896
The generative model in the singing from

77
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,544
the same hymn sheet is very much

78
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,980
like the sheet music example provided

79
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,680
in the textbook.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,420
There's a known sheet music script

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,572
such that even when there's like an

82
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:33,230
error in the playing of the music,

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,610
still the sheet music can be heard.

84
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,520
So just coarsely

85
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,760
what generative models?

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,556
I think it's pretty straightforward to

87
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,876
see how a generative model could have

88
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,724
the notation or the sheet music and then

89
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,556
use the sheet music as its prior to kind

90
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:59,300
of converge reality.

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,944
To what extent is communication that

92
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:07,924
way? Is it totally

93
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:09,572
disparate and differently structured?

94
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,252
Or is it a little bit like a hybrid?

95
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:13,316
Like you're doing inference on the sheet

96
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,804
music that they're about to say and then

97
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,356
you use your inference about what

98
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,116
they're about to say to converge what

99
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,110
they do say?

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,556
Well, you asked a good question, which

101
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:25,932
is, well, what are some alternative

102
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:30,848
frameworks? And I

103
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:32,544
know, I know some or should know some,

104
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,336
and they're not clean to mind. What

105
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,816
comes to mind most immediately in this

106
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,564
example is a phase lock loop in

107
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:41,140
electronics which is simply a way of

108
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,912
synchronizing one circuit's oscillation

109
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:48,176
with another. And this is like a phase

110
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,352
lock loop with a bigger vocabulary. So

111
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,244
figure out where we are in the pattern

112
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:58,570
and then synchronize with it.

113
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,116
But the question of what other

114
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,380
frameworks?

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,150
I mean, there's this whole field of

116
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,760
conversation analysis.

117
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,328
Which. The field is actually called

118
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:26,464
CA conversation analysis. And they have

119
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:30,404
identified patterns of how

120
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:34,070
people communicate through certain

121
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,580
structure of I guess we call them

122
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,048
rhetorical devices for achieving the

123
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,896
purpose of the conversation. So the

124
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,648
purpose of the communication is kind of

125
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,284
bedrock. And there are multiple

126
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,624
purposes, some of which are

127
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:54,190
instrumental, some are which are social.

128
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,800
And then they have identified patterns

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,124
for the way human conversation tends to

130
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:06,200
proceed which are culturally influenced.

131
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,896
There's some cross cultural aspects,

132
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,424
but then there are certain different

133
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:10,736
cultures that have different takes on

134
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,072
it. So they identify things like, okay,

135
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,716
now we're in the conversation opening

136
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:18,276
phase. Now we're in a phase of where

137
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,276
we're exchanging information and we have

138
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:23,590
turntaking. Now we have notions of

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,744
epistemic leadership or epistemic

140
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,852
authority. Who's the person who's

141
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,596
asking? Who's the person who's answering

142
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:35,656
or taking those roles in the

143
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,736
conversation? And there are certain

144
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,930
rhetorical stances that are taken.

145
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,990
That's a pretty well worked out,

146
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,030
I guess, even formalized system because

147
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,940
there are well identified patterns.

148
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,816
It's not strictly worked out because it

149
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,556
seems like every domain a conversation

150
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:03,072
analyst goes to and every every group

151
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,730
has their own kind of flavor of it. But

152
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,064
it does have this aspect of

153
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:13,104
synchronizing with respect to the

154
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,296
underlying known patterns of each of the

155
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:16,880
parties in the conversation.

156
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,160
Bird Song is also ollie, please.

157
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,054
Sorry. Adding to what Eric just

158
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:44,560
mentioned that reminded me of

159
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,690
a mechanism on a much smaller scale,

160
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,940
namely the scale of cells and so on,

161
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,654
and particularly the model proposed

162
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:03,174
by Stuart Kaufman because he

163
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:06,786
talks about the pluripotent,

164
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,462
potent nature of cells and how they

165
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,846
communicate with each other in the

166
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,462
context of phenomena of induction,

167
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:15,050
biological induction.

168
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,198
I mean, in the embryological development

169
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:23,798
stage of the cells, almost all cells are

170
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,606
pluripotent and they're capable of

171
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:29,166
becoming any of the different types of

172
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,834
cells which characterize the adult

173
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,760
individual. So that also,

174
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,970
from Kaufman's model perspective,

175
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,550
these kind of inductive signals,

176
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,094
or so to speak, communicative signals

177
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:51,366
between cells can act as a kind of

178
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:55,494
nonspecific stimulus which switch a cell

179
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,926
among a variety of internally available

180
00:10:58,028 --> 00:10:59,160
stable states.

181
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,746
Or let's put it this way the

182
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,066
basic idea in this model is that the

183
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,706
regulatory genes within a cell form a

184
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:16,270
complex network in which genes

185
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,582
interacting by their products can turn

186
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,440
one another on or off.

187
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,474
These patterns exhibit the kind of

188
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,802
homeostatic stability associated with

189
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,302
attractors of the systems.

190
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:38,942
So I think that translates

191
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:42,006
perfectly into this scale as well. This

192
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:42,680
is small.

193
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,466
Yeah. The mapping

194
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:51,262
of communication as generalized

195
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,426
synchrony may be compatible with a

196
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:58,250
variety of communication mechanisms.

197
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,666
And so it abstracts us from the

198
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:06,240
media of communication per se

199
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,126
because we can talk about the

200
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:11,086
informational synchronizations between,

201
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,126
for example, the two internal states of

202
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:18,094
the two entities or multilateral

203
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:20,078
synchronizations with environmental

204
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:23,330
states or so on. Um,

205
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,586
like thinking about the Bayesian

206
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,270
mechanics, Bayesian physics,

207
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,510
the synchronizing metronomes.

208
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,638
They don't have a hymn sheet, they don't

209
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:44,890
have sheet music. Their embodiment

210
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:52,250
and coupling enables

211
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,490
synchronization.

212
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,206
One thing I might note, I think you

213
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:01,886
asked a good question here, which is how

214
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,240
would you translate something like

215
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,314
conversation analysis or human

216
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:10,894
conversation into an active inference

217
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:17,426
model? That kind

218
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:21,270
of reminds me that the continuous valued

219
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,510
models because they're limited

220
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,314
by what you can do in these differential

221
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,554
equations, they seem to be fairly

222
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,474
simple. Whereas if I were to do

223
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,282
something like thinking about human

224
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,814
conversation in terms of active

225
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:39,146
inference, I would want something more a

226
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,050
very highly high dimensional or

227
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,060
multistate type of system where I can

228
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,110
have more complex patterns

229
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,374
and they may not make these loops,

230
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:59,346
these voltera loops. Is that what they

231
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:01,698
call voltera? Is that right? Or is this

232
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:06,194
Lawrence something? That dynamics and

233
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:09,846
the Lawrence yeah, so they may

234
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,782
not make those continuous loops, but

235
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:16,274
you'd still get good structured patterns

236
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,410
out of discrete systems.

237
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,538
So I'd kind of be curious and I think

238
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:25,500
this chapter would be cool if it had

239
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,146
something about communication and

240
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,226
synchrony, pattern synchrony, but in

241
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,766
terms of discrete valued active

242
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:34,878
inference models instead of the

243
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:38,240
continuous valued ones. Yeah,

244
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,006
very interesting. That's what I was

245
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,830
wondering. Which is why is communication

246
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,466
continuous time models are argued to be

247
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:53,906
a natural fit for motor control? Are

248
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:57,822
communication situations naturally

249
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:02,246
fit for one or the other? Seems like no,

250
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:05,526
you could imagine it either way. And

251
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:09,094
then also the synchronization means

252
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,594
the internal state of one creature

253
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:12,434
should come to resolve the resemble

254
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:13,814
internal state of another. A primitive

255
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:17,434
kind of theory of mind, I think. Not as

256
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:21,254
a fatal

257
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:24,974
critique, but these examples put

258
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:27,982
the rabbit in the hat a little bit too

259
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:31,214
keenly. Like the planning example we

260
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,566
explored wasn't truly planning. It was

261
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:38,322
like a parameterized subspace where

262
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:42,510
single step optimization emulated

263
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,466
planning. Now, one could argue that they

264
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,666
believe that that's actually like a

265
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:47,726
better approach than true explicit

266
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:50,006
planning, but that's not what was on the

267
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:53,574
COVID And then similarly, theory of

268
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:56,406
mind, though qualitatively, may be a

269
00:15:56,428 --> 00:16:00,150
framing for communication. We're talking

270
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,694
still about the birdsong where they have

271
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,006
the same shared a prior regenerative

272
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:08,314
model. So this doesn't in

273
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:10,954
other words, theory of mind is

274
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,846
axiomatically and implicitly embedded

275
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:17,066
within this model, rather than active

276
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:20,314
inference being used as in a priori

277
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:23,950
first principles to generate some

278
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,320
realized computational theory of mind.

279
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,266
I feel like, yeah, it's like another

280
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,678
aspect of the continuous valued

281
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,266
formulations is there's really not that

282
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,726
many degrees of freedom, but when you're

283
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,454
communicating anything other than a

284
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:43,446
fixed song, there's a lot of degrees of

285
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,426
freedom. And that's why we have symbol

286
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,862
systems. But symbol systems is where you

287
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,414
would use a discrete model framework for

288
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:53,160
not a continuous value to win.

289
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,980
Okay, let's talk about hybrid

290
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,420
models, discrete and continuous models

291
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,424
and learning and updating. So these are

292
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:13,170
two features. Chapter eight is

293
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,160
within a continuous time framework,

294
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,150
just like chapter seven, layered in

295
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,124
these kind of patterns or archetypes of

296
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:30,496
discrete time models in chapter

297
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,610
eight, analogously, the most

298
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,496
kernel continuous time formalism is

299
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,944
introduced with movement control and

300
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:42,968
then we're going to see some kind of

301
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:47,420
extensions or patterns

302
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,664
like design patterns that include

303
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:51,870
continuous time.

304
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,400
This is the message passing.

305
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,076
Okay, so missing line here, but we

306
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:13,532
have here, this top

307
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,440
half is like the bottom of figure 4.3,

308
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,464
or the top, I guess, discrete time. So

309
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:22,684
we have B matrix as a transition matrix.

310
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:26,210
We have discrete time and we have

311
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,164
discrete time. T plus one, t minus one.

312
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:35,636
But within each time point we

313
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:39,304
see the continuous time e whatever

314
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:43,672
we want to call this motif where

315
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,888
the B transition matrix in discrete time

316
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:51,320
is functionally substituted

317
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,932
with a derivative map such

318
00:18:55,986 --> 00:19:00,632
that rather than actually retro

319
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:04,512
or forecasting state values through

320
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:07,548
time. This is much more like a Taylor

321
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,304
Series approximation, where

322
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:13,250
extrapolation from the present,

323
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,024
under the auspices of slower changing

324
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,848
causes v, which play a functional role

325
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:22,144
of policies, higher derivatives

326
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,936
capture more and more variance further

327
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,950
and further from the origin.

328
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,570
What is the Ita doing?

329
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,080
It's playing some functional role to g

330
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,846
again, allowing for a line here in the

331
00:19:55,868 --> 00:20:00,034
sense that it is selecting

332
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:03,706
policy, but it's not policy that's being

333
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:05,274
selected or discussed this way, but

334
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,962
these slower changing factors that

335
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,220
influence how the derivatives are made.

336
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,670
But is EDA a free energy variable?

337
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,400
Let's just ask,

338
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,794
okay, what do people

339
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,294
think about this type of hybrid

340
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:46,442
modeling? How does

341
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,880
this align with

342
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,226
the previous decades of analog digital

343
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,310
signals engineering and the interfaces,

344
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,826
the digitalization of analog noise and

345
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:05,460
signals and so on?

346
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,214
Well, I'll lay off one thought,

347
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:16,680
if it's all right.

348
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,134
So one

349
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:28,278
of the things that active inference lets

350
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:31,930
you do is look at a past trajectory

351
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,266
and figure out how to interpret it in

352
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:40,894
terms of your variable, your state

353
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:45,690
variables. So essentially,

354
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,306
you look for the probability

355
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:53,342
distribution over variables

356
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:55,954
that optimizes the free energy and that

357
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,740
allows you to look back in time and

358
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,290
reinterpret evidence because

359
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,426
you get something new. And in light of

360
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,266
new evidence and in some of the earlier

361
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:10,822
chapters, they had this kind of example

362
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:15,046
and they had the example of a

363
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:17,686
dynamic programming kind of a model for

364
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,846
this. So I would expect that to be the

365
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:24,226
case also in communication systems.

366
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:25,722
And I guess I'm going back again to

367
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,566
communication where to some extent

368
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,766
you're able to reinterpret what you

369
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:34,286
thought you heard before. It's kind

370
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:36,910
of rare in language, but it happens.

371
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,310
There are garden path sentences,

372
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,966
but usually most communication

373
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,406
systems try to be relatively

374
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:50,222
hierarchical in that once you interpret

375
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,866
your continuous value signal, then you

376
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,546
don't leave a lot of ambiguity. You kind

377
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,106
of fix on that and then you have to deal

378
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,486
with it later and sometimes you go back

379
00:22:58,508 --> 00:23:01,606
and do repair. So I'm wondering if this

380
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,926
figure 8.6, if that allows that kind of

381
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:07,378
dynamics where you're

382
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:08,438
kind of tracking something at the

383
00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:10,086
continuous value level, you're tracking

384
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:12,842
a signal. Why? Effectively by making

385
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,946
predictions of what you're going to

386
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:17,946
hear, what you observe and then

387
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:21,680
is that able in this framework to go and

388
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,480
influence the symbol level,

389
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,594
the S variables above

390
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,966
and how far back in time is it able to

391
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,980
do that? Nice.

392
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,834
That makes me think about phonemes down

393
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:41,010
here and audio.

394
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,546
And then here are the spellings.

395
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:49,190
So in a language or someone is speaking

396
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,706
unclearly or you're not super familiar

397
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:51,750
with a language,

398
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,954
then you really are like doing inference

399
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:01,734
on the whole time series. It's like

400
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:05,390
that kind of retrocasting

401
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,362
which can include even revisionism and

402
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:10,230
delusions and false memories and all of

403
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,234
that. Now casting including the tension

404
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:16,414
between representing things quote as

405
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:19,822
they are versus like having

406
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,834
delusions in the presence and then

407
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:24,366
anticipation, which of course hasn't

408
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:27,438
even happened unless you have a vision

409
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:31,042
of time as something

410
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:35,954
that always was or however. So it's

411
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:39,782
really interesting that although this

412
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:43,174
time T is an index, we are doing

413
00:24:43,212 --> 00:24:46,006
inference across these and maybe it

414
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:49,002
would speak to some measure of

415
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:53,050
information processing and

416
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,050
memory and anticipation.

417
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:04,110
The extent to which meaning

418
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,374
is able to be the

419
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,566
closer meaning is to a critical point.

420
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,726
Like the more this graph structure if

421
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:16,290
someone says but I was just kidding,

422
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,786
you would want that to apply to

423
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:21,826
be like oh, I didn't know I was in

424
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:23,826
Apprentices. And now that they were just

425
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:25,060
kidding about that.

426
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,990
So it's actually like delineating those

427
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,118
structural markers and then

428
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:39,020
reinterpreting meaning is

429
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,330
perhaps moving towards the kind of

430
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,490
linguistic modeling.

431
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,720
So yeah, to come back to it.

432
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,486
So this could be a waveform. The

433
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:57,726
observables down here could be just a

434
00:25:57,748 --> 00:26:00,634
Fourier analysis or a pure auditory

435
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:01,710
waveform.

436
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,336
Yeah, I think phonemes is that's what

437
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:13,490
comes to mind? Also.

438
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,110
Okay. Ocular motor tasks.

439
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:32,558
So selecting a target location and using

440
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:35,962
motor behavior functionally eyes to fove

441
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,650
eight the target.

442
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,500
Figure 87. Okay, so figure eight seven

443
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,680
is a hybrid or mixed generative model.

444
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,426
Higher level is this is kind of like the

445
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,918
decision making motor active inference

446
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:55,930
fusion.

447
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,230
Here we have a little bit of the italics

448
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,290
and bold,

449
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,186
which we could dive into, but don't need

450
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,300
to do so at this moment.

451
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,894
So my recollection for last week was

452
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:22,994
that that corresponded to generative

453
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,926
model versus process model. You think

454
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,318
that might map again here? I know you

455
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:30,620
didn't want to dive into it.

456
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,694
I believe it does. Let's just remind

457
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:34,426
ourselves where it came up earlier in

458
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,346
the chapter. Yeah, it was always the

459
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:40,394
very beginning right here with

460
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:44,042
italics versus process in bold

461
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,710
model in italics.

462
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,054
So 87. So now

463
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:56,446
here the discrete

464
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:58,450
model is on a time period of 200

465
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,014
milliseconds. Continuous model operates

466
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:05,534
continuously. I think this speaks

467
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:09,458
to how biological knowledge

468
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,678
can be encoded in the model

469
00:28:12,764 --> 00:28:16,402
structure. I mean, a more comprehensive

470
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,226
approach would have done parameter

471
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:19,786
sweeps for what the optimal number of

472
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,802
milliseconds is to do a discrete model

473
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:24,762
on. However, one could say,

474
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,686
like, well, the physiology that we're

475
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,026
interested in is accomplished with a

476
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:33,914
gamma EEG cycle. The gamma EEG

477
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,958
cycle is this many milliseconds. So

478
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:40,718
we're just going to treat that

479
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,966
as like a discrete rhythm. Like, one can

480
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,146
imagine if the discrete time were one

481
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:49,566
millisecond here, you would be losing

482
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:51,906
computational advantage and you'd be

483
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:55,634
kind of like overslicing. Because if

484
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:58,162
eye movement does happen on a timescale

485
00:28:58,226 --> 00:29:01,190
of hundreds of milliseconds,

486
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,038
discretizing to one millisecond is going

487
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:07,222
to be too fine, and discretizing to 1

488
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:09,894
second is not going to enable multiple

489
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,170
actions to be taken within that frame.

490
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,906
So timescale and spatial scale of a

491
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,570
system might be able to be encoded

492
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,350
at the phase of its construction or

493
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,750
structure learning more generally.

494
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,840
Okay,

495
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,594
doubtsian mixture model and

496
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:43,906
the hierarchical. Yeah, sorry, before we

497
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:47,890
move on, just about the isochods,

498
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,366
I don't understand what is gained by an

499
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:54,166
active inference model for this. I mean,

500
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:55,858
why not just say you got a controller

501
00:29:55,954 --> 00:29:58,006
and it's a control loop and that's good

502
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:58,600
enough?

503
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,484
Yes. In live

504
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:10,484
stream number 50, which we're just

505
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:13,184
preparing for, it's like very classical

506
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,560
cybernetic control loop,

507
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,756
homeostatic dynamics. And it's

508
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:24,408
interesting to ask

509
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,596
again, what makes the model active

510
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:30,044
inference? One could

511
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:33,276
say that there's a Markov blanket, but

512
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,740
between every one of these variables,

513
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,776
it is a model of action and perception,

514
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:40,736
like so many other models of action and

515
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:44,604
perception. So what is being shown

516
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:48,736
here is it that the

517
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:52,420
single imperative that energy based

518
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,228
imperatives just

519
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,900
speaking narrowly here, energy based

520
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,644
imperatives can mediate decision

521
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:07,972
making in discrete continuous hybrid

522
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:08,920
models,

523
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,774
and that it's possible to have a

524
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:26,730
categorical decision making model in

525
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,246
feedback with a continuous ocular motor

526
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:30,860
model.

527
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,072
At the very least, it places this type

528
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:46,376
of model within

529
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:50,276
the domain and grammar of active

530
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,640
inference modeling.

531
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,346
Data clustering. We may have touched

532
00:32:14,378 --> 00:32:17,510
upon also hierarchical Gaussian filter

533
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,210
that I know some people have worked

534
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,900
on.

535
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,462
Okay, let's look at some of the summary

536
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,790
advances in continuous time models.

537
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,894
Synthetic birdsong. We talked about

538
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:34,520
this.

539
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:44,686
Ocular motor delays conditioned

540
00:32:44,718 --> 00:32:48,550
reflex. Okay, so this is in the chapter.

541
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,206
This is in the chapter. I don't know

542
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:52,950
about this exact paper, perhaps, but

543
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,774
Ocular motor is in the chapter and

544
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,906
smooth eye pursuits, conditioned

545
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:01,066
reflexes, that is in this chapter. The

546
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:02,458
blank, the conditioned and the

547
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:07,370
unconditioned stimuli building

548
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,526
on the songbird model. But the songbird

549
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:10,940
model was in 2015.

550
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,386
False inference from suboptimal prior

551
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:21,906
beliefs. Can prior beliefs

552
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,190
be suboptimal?

553
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,322
Sorry. Actually, Friston has talked

554
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:33,420
about bird songs before 2015 in

555
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,554
one of his papers, I think from 2013 or

556
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:40,670
twelve. Yeah, it's from 2013,

557
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,782
which is co authored with his son,

558
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:50,850
I guess. Dominic A. Friston 2015

559
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,300
paper was not the first paper.

560
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,466
The name of the paper is the Free Energy

561
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,866
Formulation of Music Generation and

562
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:02,580
Perception. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.

563
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,470
Wow. Yeah, good find reminder.

564
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,200
Interesting.

565
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,406
Looks very much like the textbook, you

566
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:15,866
know, opening quotes. I can

567
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,500
see how this is related to your

568
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,260
researching too.

569
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,714
Okay. Maybe even 2009.

570
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,680
Birdsong chaotic Attractors. Wow.

571
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,294
It's ten plus years on the

572
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:37,870
birdsong paradigm.

573
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,534
Okay, so deviations

574
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,250
in perception,

575
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,894
more eye movement. It's kind of fun.

576
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:56,214
Like how we've talked about babbling and

577
00:34:56,252 --> 00:34:58,534
that across different domains like

578
00:34:58,572 --> 00:35:02,066
cicading. Now there's the Ocular motor

579
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:04,086
cicade, but are there other kinds of

580
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,270
cicadings?

581
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,222
For example, I think that knowledge

582
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:15,494
management niches facilitate semantic

583
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,702
cicading. Yes. Enabled by visual

584
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,466
cicading as well because you have to be

585
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:21,166
like looking around on the page, but

586
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,600
it's just like what was chapter four?

587
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,286
Okay, that's what we were talking about,

588
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:29,326
chapter four. What's notation? I think

589
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:32,242
it's just sort of like the analog to

590
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,860
scanning around a little. Bit,

591
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,206
but just have in conversational analysis

592
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:40,654
that's a very important topic is topic

593
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:41,300
control.

594
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,522
If you look at any, most conversations

595
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:52,866
have multiple threads going. So it's

596
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:56,566
like a fugue in Bach. Okay, which voice

597
00:35:56,598 --> 00:36:00,186
is this? Every note is in a voice and

598
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,554
the voice has got some topic and they

599
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:03,530
intertwine.

600
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,490
In Godel, usherbach,

601
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,620
prelude, ant fugue.

602
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,628
Nice. This is very interesting and I

603
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:22,916
think it starts to plant

604
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,560
some seeds towards, again,

605
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,116
semantic circading, computational

606
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,240
conversation analysis and generation

607
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,092
adaptive knowledge environments like

608
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:39,960
visual accessibility is one topic.

609
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,812
If somebody has a visual difference,

610
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,876
then making sure that they can see it is

611
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,240
the enabling system. But let's just

612
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,024
assume that we're within a space where

613
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:51,040
we can talk about what is being seen.

614
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,816
So then how does someone get a

615
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,472
clear picture of what we're talking

616
00:36:57,526 --> 00:37:00,544
about? That would be through some sort

617
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:04,500
of circade where you would recognize

618
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,916
more uncertainty at the periphery and

619
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:11,332
the phobia in this case is paying

620
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,876
attention to the conversation. And

621
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,588
that's why with a language we're

622
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:17,256
unfamiliar with, we get a little bit

623
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,020
lost because our cicade, we're too slow,

624
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,828
we don't have the fluency to circade.

625
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:24,876
And so the video is moving too fast to

626
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,956
track. So we're just kind of like

627
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,572
randomly listening and trying to

628
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:32,044
compute. But what if

629
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:35,608
somebody were on a guided cicade journey

630
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:39,216
through their semantic landscape. I

631
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:40,416
mean, just to take this a little bit

632
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:44,128
further, this is also maybe

633
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:47,292
it's a critical element of cognitive

634
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,580
architecture, which is the ability to

635
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,036
topic switch. And in psychology and

636
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:55,728
cognitive science, there's this notion

637
00:37:55,744 --> 00:37:57,236
of executive control. And one of the

638
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:59,556
fundamentals of executive control is to

639
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,596
be able to topic switch. So you're on

640
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:05,076
some task, you get an interrupt, you

641
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:06,936
have to put that on a stack, deal with

642
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,544
your interrupt. Then when you're done,

643
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:11,496
maybe the interrupt is a goal, it could

644
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,144
be a sub goal, it could be some other

645
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:14,408
topic that comes in, something you have

646
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:15,816
to deal with. Then when you're done,

647
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,272
you have to be able to pull that back,

648
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:19,964
push that back off the stack and get

649
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:21,916
back to where you were. So all that

650
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:23,772
context switching is really I mean,

651
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:25,436
there's measures of how people do this

652
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,600
and there's debates about whether people

653
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,996
can multitask or not, whether they're

654
00:38:30,028 --> 00:38:32,076
actually really multitasking or they're

655
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:35,996
just multithreading, but they're

656
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:37,612
dividing the amount of computational

657
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:39,948
process by the number of processes you

658
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:41,364
have going. So you're actually not doing

659
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,456
multiple things at once as effectively

660
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,510
as if you just stuck with one.

661
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,692
And then it's like, do we have that

662
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,720
intel hyperthreading capacity?

663
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,960
Is it a virtualized hyper thread?

664
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,784
On one thread? Are there actually

665
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:03,240
different threads?

666
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,460
Yeah, I mean the conversation analysis,

667
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,776
other than us being right in the thick

668
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,500
of it and it being highly engaging,

669
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,704
support an area. Let's just continue

670
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,500
through this cases here. Action

671
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,600
observation. Okay. Mirror neurons.

672
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,056
This may be very much related to the

673
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:36,576
birdsong singing from the same hymn

674
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,676
sheet or whatever and then doing the

675
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:41,700
same dance. Attention.

676
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,930
This is a super fascinating area and

677
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,544
I think a lot of notebooks and

678
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:55,204
applications like just taking

679
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:58,044
a trace of somebody's browsing on

680
00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:01,756
Wikipedia or across websites and

681
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:04,076
then reconstructing components of their

682
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:05,564
generative model based upon their

683
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:08,770
salience revealed choice is a huge area.

684
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,084
And then doing again, that with Ocular

685
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:12,640
motor, with Webcams,

686
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,680
and doing it with semantic landscapes,

687
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,100
hybrid modeling, self organization,

688
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,324
arguably with some pretty interesting

689
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:31,476
advances in the last several months and

690
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:35,732
days from Fields, Levin and others on

691
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:39,444
the And Forestaged earlier,

692
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,524
but on the morphogenesis as Bayesian

693
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,440
inference.

694
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,014
Okay, in our last few

695
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:54,446
minutes here, let's just look ahead to

696
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:55,966
nine because I think this is setting us

697
00:40:55,988 --> 00:40:56,720
up well.

698
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,800
Okay,

699
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,438
model based data analysis or databased

700
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:14,340
modeling, or however we want to say this

701
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:19,602
is about parameterizing structured

702
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,150
models with observations.

703
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,850
So rather than just by fiat dictate

704
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,278
saying this is the structure of the

705
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:30,874
model and it spits out observations like

706
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:33,354
so and so. We want to be able to

707
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:35,898
actually run it backwards, not as a

708
00:41:35,904 --> 00:41:37,414
generative model, but as a recognition

709
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:40,250
model, so to speak, in this expectation

710
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,370
maximization framework and parameterize

711
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,942
our generative model from sparse or

712
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:49,342
dense observations. And that's also

713
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:52,962
called parametric empirical base because

714
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:55,522
you're parameterizing the prior based

715
00:41:55,576 --> 00:41:59,330
upon the mean invariance and patterns of

716
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,980
some empirical data.

717
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,310
Okay? The metabasian approach,

718
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,110
base theorem.

719
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,906
This may even be something that could be

720
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:20,214
introduced earlier, even though it's

721
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:21,690
also meta.

722
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,174
This is like the map territory fallacy,

723
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:30,750
fallacy graphical abstract,

724
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,278
which is we're making a map here's us in

725
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:36,718
the bigger box, even though there's a

726
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:40,046
dashed box even beyond us. We're making

727
00:42:40,148 --> 00:42:43,890
a map of a cognitive entity

728
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,422
in its map making of its generative

729
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:51,570
process. And that was the subject also

730
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,898
of some very rich discussion several

731
00:42:54,914 --> 00:42:57,430
days ago with Yaakov and Dali and Dalton

732
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,400
Ali, anything to add on this?

733
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,220
No, nothing much. But.

734
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,702
One general comment I wanted to make

735
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:17,480
about chapter nine is that,

736
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,250
you see, because of my project

737
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,474
that I've been working on for the past

738
00:43:24,512 --> 00:43:26,906
several months, this chapter nine has

739
00:43:26,928 --> 00:43:29,466
been quite helpful in developing some of

740
00:43:29,488 --> 00:43:33,274
my ideas around how

741
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:38,974
to exactly model my music

742
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:41,578
emotional recognition system that I've

743
00:43:41,594 --> 00:43:44,382
been working on. But I wanted to point

744
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:47,700
out one small caveat here,

745
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,514
which is that you see, at least

746
00:43:52,552 --> 00:43:56,530
in my opinion, chapter nine, or this

747
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,750
so called model based data analysis,

748
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:06,150
is not conducive to generate

749
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:12,470
on every model that's been described

750
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,566
throughout the book. It's just focused

751
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:20,394
on some specific kinds of models. So it

752
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:24,014
might not be generalizable to every

753
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,202
kind of model that we've seen throughout

754
00:44:26,346 --> 00:44:28,030
all the previous chapters.

755
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,570
Good point. Some models

756
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,258
might be just plug and play, so to

757
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:39,538
speak, and other ones might take a

758
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:42,930
little bit more work to get to use

759
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,890
empirically.

760
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,874
Okay, let's just continued in our last

761
00:44:47,912 --> 00:44:50,258
minutes to scan through so metabasian

762
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,214
process. We're drawing inferences about

763
00:44:52,252 --> 00:44:53,560
an inferential process.

764
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,586
It's a key point. And that's

765
00:44:59,618 --> 00:45:01,658
the two levels of mapping. It's like the

766
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:09,846
map of the map variational,

767
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:14,990
LaPlace variational, bayes factorized

768
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,794
models for computational simplicity

769
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:22,286
and interpretability based upon the

770
00:45:22,308 --> 00:45:24,926
sparsity of coupling of variables in a

771
00:45:24,948 --> 00:45:29,298
Bayes graph. And LaPlace using

772
00:45:29,464 --> 00:45:33,570
a parabolic approximator of

773
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,810
the mode and a variance to ensure

774
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,290
a simple optimizable heuristic.

775
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,686
Not that it perfectly recapitulates

776
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:47,378
capitulates the shape of the posterior,

777
00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:49,906
which doesn't have to be inverted

778
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:53,530
quadratic, but the LaPlace approximation

779
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,394
is smoothly optimizable for both the

780
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:59,626
mode and the variance. And here's where

781
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:01,206
they mentioned that's the parametric

782
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:03,622
empirical Bayesian approach and

783
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:06,286
basically LaPlace approximation can be

784
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:11,134
thought of as making a commitment to the

785
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:14,974
quadratic form. So choosing the family

786
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,706
that your prior is going to be of and

787
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:22,530
then bootstrapping your initial prior

788
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,998
with your observed data bootstrapping

789
00:46:26,014 --> 00:46:28,578
not in the resampling sense, but in the

790
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:30,580
starting oneself out sense.

791
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:37,430
This was explored more in

792
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,200
other works,

793
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,626
but you have some likelihood function of

794
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:47,900
all the parameters l of data and

795
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:56,250
optimizing action involves

796
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:01,230
computing beliefs about policy such

797
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,222
that policies are proportionally taking

798
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:09,010
up slices of the pie monotonically

799
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,514
with respect to their free energy. And

800
00:47:12,552 --> 00:47:15,214
then there's a precision on action

801
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:17,458
parameter where you can turn it all the

802
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:18,934
way down to sort of like don't know,

803
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,826
don't care, where even large differences

804
00:47:21,858 --> 00:47:24,662
in free energy between policies get

805
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,070
equilibrated out. That's like hot

806
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,058
decision making. And then absolute zero

807
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:33,366
decision making would be a policy that's

808
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:37,018
even 51% more likely would

809
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,066
be always selected. So the

810
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:42,954
variation of free energy, expected free

811
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:46,526
energy, it's a bound on surprise due to

812
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:48,574
Jensen's inequality and evidence lower

813
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:49,966
bound. And all this other work in

814
00:47:49,988 --> 00:47:54,138
variational inference. And then that pi

815
00:47:54,234 --> 00:47:57,986
slicing can be tuned up or down with

816
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:01,854
a shaky hand parameter. Soft max

817
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:03,170
temperature parameter.

818
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,126
If the soft max is one, the pie is

819
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:15,138
undistorted. If the soft max

820
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:18,882
is large, you have a relentless

821
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:22,150
bias for better policies.

822
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,260
Or it can be less than one.

823
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,498
Here's some technical details of the

824
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:30,890
LaPlace approximation.

825
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,000
Parametric empirical base,

826
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,030
generalized linear modeling,

827
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,990
hashtag SPM.

828
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,254
Here's recipe. So this is kind of like

829
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,954
chapter six, but now it's model based

830
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,180
data analysis. Collect behavioral data.

831
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,706
Maybe the data has already been

832
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:56,286
collected. Maybe there's some data sets

833
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,098
that we already can use. Formulate a

834
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,946
POMDP. I wonder if this is as chapter

835
00:49:02,978 --> 00:49:06,086
six, not as chapter seven. It could be

836
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:07,778
chapter seven as well. If it's discrete

837
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:08,360
time,

838
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,506
specify likelihood, perhaps we can,

839
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:19,030
in the coming weeks, check out SPM

840
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,650
Mdpvx,

841
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,210
and they mention the scripts,

842
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:31,806
data. This is nice. This will

843
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:34,686
be fun. Chapter seven. I mean, it is the

844
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:38,740
correct if they're using this type four.

845
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,260
Chapter seven. Chapter four.

846
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,754
So this looks pretty

847
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,074
cool, pretty interesting. We could walk

848
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,930
through some examples.

849
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,840
False inference,

850
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,040
computational pathology.

851
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,548
So it kind of ends like chapter eight

852
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:10,308
with a table of references and a

853
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:13,860
summary. So it's a pretty short chapter

854
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,252
and has

855
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:22,824
some formalisms, but it's only

856
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:27,690
from page 179 of the PDF to

857
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,960
196, so it's less than 20 pages.

858
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,036
The next chapter, I think, is the

859
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:39,068
longest chapter in the book. Which one

860
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:42,110
is chapter ten? Chapter ten, 197.

861
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,400
Yeah. That one's over 30 pages.

862
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,210
Yeah,

863
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,230
but it ends on a high note.

864
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,180
All right, well,

865
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:06,638
interesting conversations.

866
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,340
Thanks for this. We will come

867
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,080
back to chapter nine,

868
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,600
look through it, and then peep into ten,

869
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,990
go through ten, and really solidify our

870
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,574
understanding of the map

871
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:27,930
and I guess indirectly of the territory.

872
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,370
And then for those who want to join,

873
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,278
we'll probably continue the discussion

874
00:51:34,374 --> 00:51:37,210
and especially start looking towards

875
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,514
those project ideas again. Like we

876
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,034
talked just a little earlier about

877
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:46,006
making a dot

878
00:51:46,038 --> 00:51:48,650
zero sessions for the textbook.

879
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,494
It so I have to apologize.

880
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,398
I'm traveling for a few weeks, so I'm

881
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:57,650
going to miss the next several sessions.

882
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,474
It's all good. Thank you, Eric. Any

883
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:02,834
other comments people want to make or

884
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:04,370
I'll close the recording.

885
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,330
Okay, thank you.
