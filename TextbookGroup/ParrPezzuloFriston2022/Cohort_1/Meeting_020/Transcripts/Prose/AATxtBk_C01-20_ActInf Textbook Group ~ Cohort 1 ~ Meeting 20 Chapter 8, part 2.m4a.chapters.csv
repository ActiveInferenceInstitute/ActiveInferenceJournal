90	71400	00:00	It's october 14, 2022. We're in our second discussion of chapter eight. Some of the areas we wanted to pick up on involved learning and hierarchical modeling and hybrid modeling. Maybe we can preview some chapter nine.	We're in our second discussion of chapter eight	Foster 8
96020	578560	01:36	How do other frameworks for communication cybernetic ish or otherwise deal with the semantics of conversation, improvisation, open endedness in conversation? To what extent is communication that way? Is it totally disparate and differently structured?	The birdsong model is widely pointed at as an example of how communication is modeled	Inclusion in Communication: The Birdsong Model
578930	774490	09:38	The mapping of communication as generalized synchrony may be compatible with a variety of communication mechanisms. The basic idea in this model is that the regulatory genes within a cell form a complex network. Their embodiment and coupling enables synchronization.	Stuart Kaufman proposes generalized synchrony model for communicating between cells	Immunity 6, Communication between cells
777490	1013160	12:57	How would you translate something like conversation analysis or human conversation into an active inference model? Why is communication continuous time models argued to be a natural fit for motor control? Are communication situations naturally fit for one or the other?	How would you translate conversation analysis into an active inference model	Inference models for communication and cognition
1018080	1210220	16:58	 chapter eight is within a continuous time framework, just like chapter seven. Within each time point we see the continuous time motif where the B transition matrix in discrete time is functionally substituted with a derivative map. Higher derivatives capture more and more variance further and further from the origin.	Chapter eight talks about discrete and continuous models and learning and updating	Learning and updating with discrete and continuous time models
1212910	1665710	20:12	But is EDA a free energy variable? Let's just ask, okay, what do people think about this type of hybrid modeling? How does this align with the previous decades of analog digital signals engineering. Reinterpreting meaning is perhaps moving towards the kind of linguistic modeling.	Active inference allows you to look back in time and reinterpret evidence	Inference and the hybrid model
1669490	1768750	27:49	So now here the discrete model is on a time period of 200 milliseconds. Continuous model operates continuously. I think this speaks to how biological knowledge can be encoded in the model structure.	This speaks to how biological knowledge can be encoded in model structure	In the case of neural networks, discrete and continuous models
1771090	2442440	29:31	We look at some of the summary advances in continuous time models. In conversational analysis that's a very important topic is topic control. It starts to plant some seeds towards, again, semantic circading and computational conversation analysis.	Dominic A. Friston developed an active inference model for conversational analysis	Active Inference in Cognition
2448510	2683890	40:48	 chapter nine is not conducive to generating on every model that's been described throughout the book. It's just focused on some specific kinds of models. Some models might be just plug and play, and other ones might take a little bit more work to get to use empirically.	Model based data analysis is about parameterizing structured models with observations	Post-9: Model-based data analysis
2685910	3131330	44:45	Eric: Let's scan through so metabasian process. This is kind of like chapter six, but now it's model based data analysis. Collect behavioral data. Formulate a POMDP. And then for those who want to join, we'll probably continue the discussion.	LaPlace approximation for optimizing policies involves computing beliefs about policy	Bayesian Inferring the Taxonomy
