1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,720
hello everyone it's October 14 2022

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,680
we're in

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,320
meeting 20. we're in our second

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,900
discussion of Chapter eight we have a

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,859
few

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,000
topics and points in chapter eight and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
then maybe we can

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,439
preview some chapter nine and have a lot

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,480
of space for any other thoughts or

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
questions people are having so

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,020
we can jump to the questions and look at

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,860
the um

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,260
written chapter 8 questions or does

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,480
anyone want to

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,339
suggest a point for us to go to

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,300
last time we know that some of the areas

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,080
we wanted to pick up on

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,180
involved learning and hierarchical

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,040
modeling and hybrid modeling

20
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,939
one question that came up I think

21
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,540
here but maybe we can revisit is the

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,860
Birdsong model

23
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,320
is widely pointed at as an example of

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,500
how communication is modeled in active

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
inference or for active inference

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,560
entities

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,720
however it's quite literally singing

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,060
from the same hymn sheet and the turn

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,079
taking is based upon uh joint

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,300
expectation of that song being sung that

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,919
way

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,680
and then the actions that the birds can

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,620
take the kind of turn taking that they

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,660
enact

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,819
is

36
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,860
against related to whether it's like

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,480
well somebody has to say it is it going

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
to be me or is it going to be that

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,640
so how do you think we would broaden

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,459
that scope

41
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,160
of communication to account for

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,879
situations

43
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,040
where there isn't a pre-scripted song

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,220
how do other Frameworks for

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,819
communication

46
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,700
cybernetic ish or otherwise

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,680
deal with

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,739
the semantics of conversation

49
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,440
improvisation

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,300
open-endedness in conversation

51
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,739
uh actually I had a

52
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,260
somewhat more general question about uh

53
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,640
the bird songs and its relation to uh

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,099
this particular systems that they've

55
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,900
developed in the textbook uh you see

56
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,420
some researchers believe that I'm sure

57
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,440
you're much uh qualified to talk about

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,459
uh this than me but

59
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,560
there are lots of research going going

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,540
around about the territorialization uh

61
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,739
function of bird songs so if we take

62
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,780
that as uh if we take a birth song as uh

63
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,239
as its territorializing mechanism at

64
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,760
least one of uh it's territorializing

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,260
mechanism uh can we

66
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,239
somehow

67
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,440
put the dynamic I mean the dynamic

68
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,620
boundary of the markup blanket uh I

69
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,800
think would be affected uh from this

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,500
point of view and then

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,900
I'm not sure how that would translate

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,479
into this specific model if we take that

73
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
Dynamic nature of the mark of blanket

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
boundary

75
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,860
yeah I guess I would just build on that

76
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,340
and say that um the communication serves

77
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,620
a purpose and so

78
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,100
um I think a model shouldn't incorporate

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,080
what that purpose is

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,940
and how it's served by the communication

81
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,040
and then whether it happens to be you

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
know syncing up with some predefined

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,500
pattern or or whatever is is a is a

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,940
follow-on consideration

85
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,979
the generative model in the singing from

86
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,540
the same hymn sheet

87
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,419
is like is very much like the sheet

88
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,100
music example

89
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,940
provided in the textbook

90
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,960
there's a known sheet music script

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,199
such that even when there's like a error

92
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,020
in the playing of the music

93
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,160
still the sheet music can be heard

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,960
so

95
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,039
just coarsely

96
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,479
what generative models

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,259
um I think it's pretty straightforward

98
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,600
to see how a generative model could have

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
the notation or the sheet music

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,220
and then use the sheet music as its

101
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,060
prior

102
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,039
to kind of converge reality

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,199
to what extent is communication that way

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,060
is it totally disparate and differently

105
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,800
structured or is it a little bit like a

106
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
hybrid like you're doing inference on

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,639
the sheet music that they're about to

108
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,979
say and then you use your inference

109
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,539
about what they're about to say to

110
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,680
converge what they do say

111
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,780
well you ask a good question which is

112
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,979
well what are some alternative

113
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,699
Frameworks and um

114
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,340
I I know I I know I know some or should

115
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,720
know some and I they're not coming to

116
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,120
mind what comes to mind uh most

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
immediately in this example is a phase

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
lock loop in electronics which is simply

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,880
a way of synchronizing one circuit's

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,199
oscillation with another

121
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,720
and um this is like a phase lock loop

122
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
with a bigger vocabulary

123
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,940
so figure out where we are in the in the

124
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,620
pattern and then

125
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,840
um

126
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,759
synchronize with it

127
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
and um

128
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,860
but to the answer the question of what

129
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,600
other Frameworks

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,660
um

131
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,440
I mean there's

132
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
this whole field of

133
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,960
um conversation analysis

134
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
um which

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,880
um well it feels actually called CA

136
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,520
conversation analysis and they have

137
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,060
identified patterns of

138
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,979
um how people communicate

139
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,720
through a certain

140
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,580
structure of I guess we call them

141
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,099
rhetorical devices for achieving the

142
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,259
purpose of the conversation so the

143
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,060
purpose of the purpose

144
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,220
of the communication is kind of Bedrock

145
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,000
but um and there are multiple purposes

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,680
some of which are instrumental some are

147
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,819
which are you know social

148
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,240
um

149
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,759
and then they have identified patterns

150
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,099
for the way human conversation tends to

151
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,120
proceed which are culturally influenced

152
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
you know there's some cross-cultural

153
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
aspects but then there's certain

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,259
different cultures that have different

155
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,660
takes on it so they identify things like

156
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,220
okay now we're in the conversation

157
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,160
opening phase now we're in a phase of

158
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,259
turn where we're exchanging information

159
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,020
and we have turn taking now we have

160
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,000
Notions of

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,780
um epistemic leadership or epistemic

162
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,220
authority

163
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,840
um you know who's who's the person who's

164
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,580
asking who's the person who's answering

165
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,760
or taking those uh those roles in the

166
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,620
conversation and and there's certain

167
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,320
rhetorical stances that are taken then

168
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,419
we have so

169
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,440
um that's a pretty well worked out

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,779
um I I don't I guess even formalized

171
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,760
system because they you know there's

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
just there are um you know well

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,000
identified patterns um it's it's not

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,220
strictly worked out because it seems

175
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,019
like every domain a conversation analyst

176
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,600
goes to and every every group has their

177
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,240
own kind of flavor of it but it is kind

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
of um

179
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,200
uh it it does have this aspect of

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
synchronizing

181
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,399
with respect to the underlying known

182
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,260
patterns of each of the parties in a

183
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,620
conversation

184
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,200
the bird song is also oh Ali please

185
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,220
uh sorry adding to what Eric just

186
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,980
mentioned uh that reminds me reminded me

187
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,360
of the uh a much mechanism on a much

188
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,940
much smaller scale

189
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,660
namely the scale of cells and so on uh

190
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,800
and uh particularly the model proposed

191
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,040
by Stuart Kaufman because

192
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,260
um he talks about the

193
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,600
pluripotent nature of cells and how they

194
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
communicate with each other uh in the

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
context of phenomena of induction

196
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,420
biological induction and uh I mean uh in

197
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,940
the embryological development stage of

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,779
the cells uh almost all cells are

199
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,640
pluripotent and they're capable of

200
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,160
becoming any of the different types of

201
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
cells which characterize the adult

202
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,899
individual so

203
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,459
um that also the the uh from Kaufman's

204
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,459
model perspective

205
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:46,200
uh these kind of uh inductive signals or

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,180
so to speak communicative signals

207
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,480
between cells can act as a kind of

208
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,459
non-specific stimulus

209
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,760
which switches cell among a variety of

210
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,480
internally available stable States uh so

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,700
uh I mean a cell

212
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,600
or let's put it this way the basic idea

213
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,820
in this model is that the regulatory

214
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,160
genes within a cell form a complex

215
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,120
Network in which genes uh interacting by

216
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,760
their products can turn one another on

217
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,700
or off you see so uh yeah these patterns

218
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,760
exhibit the kind of homeostatic

219
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,300
stability associated with attractors of

220
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,000
the systems so uh I think that

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,579
translates perfectly into this scale as

222
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,540
well this is small

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,800
yeah the

224
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,399
the mapping of communication as

225
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,800
generalized synchrony

226
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,380
may be compatible with a variety of

227
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,860
communication mechanisms

228
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,140
and so it abstracts us from the media

229
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,600
of communication per se

230
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,339
because we can talk about the

231
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,560
informational synchronizations

232
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,620
between for example the two internal

233
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,019
states of the two entities

234
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,200
or multilateral synchronizations with

235
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,100
environmental States or so on

236
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,220
um

237
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,440
like thinking about

238
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,760
um the basic mechanics Bayesian physics

239
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,899
the synchronizing metronomes

240
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,700
they don't have a hem sheet they don't

241
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,320
have sheet music

242
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,480
their embodiments

243
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,500
and coupling

244
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,060
um

245
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,339
enables

246
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,240
synchronization

247
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,519
now one thing I might know you know you

248
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,019
I think you asked a good question here

249
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,700
which is you know how would you transfer

250
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,880
translate something like um

251
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,399
um conversation analysis

252
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,380
you know a human conversation into an

253
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,839
active inference model so

254
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,579
um but that that um

255
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,339
kind of reminds me that the continuous

256
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:21,720
valued

257
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,940
um models

258
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,339
because they're limited by these by what

259
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,300
you can do in these differential

260
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,560
equations

261
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,079
they seem to be fairly simple

262
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,940
whereas if I were to do something like

263
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,100
thinking about human conversation in

264
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,740
terms of active inference I would want

265
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,380
more something more a very highly High

266
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,300
dimensional or multi-state type of

267
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,820
system where I can

268
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,959
um

269
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,139
have more complex

270
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,800
um patterns

271
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,459
and they may not make these you know

272
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,339
Loops these Volterra Loops or something

273
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,620
called Volterra is that right or is this

274
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,060
is Lawrence

275
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,979
something Dynamics yeah

276
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,980
yeah so it may not make those continuous

277
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,320
Loops but I that you'd still get

278
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,220
um

279
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,560
um you know good structured patterns out

280
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,360
of discrete

281
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,880
um systems so I've I'd kind of be

282
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
curious I think this chapter would be

283
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,540
because if it what had if it had a um uh

284
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,220
something about communication and

285
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,560
synchrony pattern synchrony but in terms

286
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,480
of discrete value

287
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,100
um active inference models as a

288
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,380
continuous valued ones

289
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,360
yeah

290
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,519
yeah very interesting like

291
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,860
that's what I was wondering which is why

292
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,620
is communication it is

293
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,480
um

294
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,519
continuous time models are argued to be

295
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,160
a natural fit for motor control

296
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,920
our communication

297
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,740
situations Naturally Fit for one or the

298
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,540
other

299
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,079
seems like I know you could imagine it

300
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,620
either way and then also like

301
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,300
um the synchronization means the

302
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
internal state of one creature should

303
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,839
come to resolve the uh resemble internal

304
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,160
states of another A Primitive kind of

305
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,260
theory of mind I think

306
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,519
um not as a um uh

307
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,440
fatal critique

308
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,980
but these examples put the rabbit in the

309
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,820
Hat

310
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,940
a little bit too keenly like the

311
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,980
planning example we explored wasn't

312
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,959
truly planning it was like a

313
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,000
parameterized

314
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,620
um Subspace

315
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,639
where single step optimization

316
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,100
emulated planning now one could argue

317
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,360
that they believe that that's actually

318
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,279
like a better approach than than true

319
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,899
explicit planning but that's not what

320
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,920
was on the um cover and then similarly

321
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,279
theory of mind though qualitatively may

322
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,339
be a framing for communication

323
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,800
we're talking still about the bird song

324
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,440
where they have the same shared a priori

325
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,180
generative model

326
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,040
so this doesn't

327
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
um in other words theory of mind is is

328
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,380
um is axiomatically and implicitly

329
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,540
embedded within this model

330
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,480
rather than active inference being used

331
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,380
as uh in a priori first principles to

332
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,199
generate some realized computational

333
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,940
theory of mind

334
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,420
I feel like yeah yeah it's like um you

335
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,760
know another aspect of this the The

336
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,500
Continuous solute formulations is

337
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,060
there's really not that many degrees of

338
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,959
freedom

339
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,000
but when you're communicating you know

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,120
anything other than a fixed song there's

341
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,579
a lot of degrees of freedom and um

342
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,620
that's why we have symbol systems but

343
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,839
simple systems is where you would use a

344
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,899
discrete model framework for not a

345
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,380
continuous value

346
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,000
okay

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
let's talk about hybrid

348
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,419
models discrete and continuous models

349
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,540
and learning and updating so these are

350
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,299
two features chapter eight

351
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,139
is

352
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,199
um

353
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,720
within a continuous time framework

354
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
just like chapter seven

355
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,400
layered in

356
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,000
these kind of patterns or archetypes of

357
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,640
discrete time models

358
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,580
in chapter 8 analogously

359
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,679
the most

360
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,500
kernel continuous time formalism is

361
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,539
introduced with movement control

362
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,539
and then we're going to see some kind of

363
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,299
extension extensions or

364
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,140
um

365
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
patterns

366
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,580
like design patterns that include

367
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,418
continuous time

368
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,959
this is the message passing

369
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,539
okay so missing line here

370
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,600
but we have

371
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,820
here this top half

372
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,000
is like the bottom of figure 4.3 or at

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,220
the top I guess discrete time

374
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,140
so we have B Matrix as a transition

375
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,840
Matrix we have discrete time

376
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,520
and we have

377
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,460
um yeah it's discrete time t plus one T

378
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,240
minus one but within each

379
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,340
time point

380
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,640
we see the continuous time you know e

381
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,919
whatever we want to call this

382
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,980
motif

383
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,260
where the B transition Matrix and

384
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,380
discrete time is

385
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,660
functionally substituted

386
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,440
with a derivative map

387
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,660
such that rather than actually uh retro

388
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,299
or forecasting

389
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,720
State values through time this is much

390
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
more like a Taylor series approximation

391
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,160
where extrapolation from the presence

392
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
under the auspices of slower changing

393
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,080
causes V which play a functional role of

394
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,059
policies

395
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,160
higher derivatives capture more and more

396
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,039
variants further and further from

397
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,879
the origin

398
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,399
what is the ETA

399
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,160
doing

400
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,620
it's playing some functional role to G

401
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,380
again allowing for a line here

402
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,240
in the sense that it is

403
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,740
selecting policy

404
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,480
but it's not it's not policy that's

405
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
being selected or discussed this way but

406
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,980
these slower changing factors that

407
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,780
influence how the derivatives are made

408
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,580
but is

409
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,260
you know a free energy variable

410
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,980
let's just ask

411
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,379
okay

412
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,000
what do people think about this type of

413
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,840
hybrid modeling

414
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,660
um how does this

415
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,480
align with

416
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,140
the previous Decades of analog digital

417
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,840
signals engineering

418
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,140
and the interfaces the digitalization of

419
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,100
analog noise and signals and um so on

420
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,460
foreign

421
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,620
well um

422
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,200
I'll only offer one thought if it's all

423
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,100
right

424
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
um

425
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
so

426
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,840
one of the things that active inference

427
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,120
let you do is look at

428
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,700
a past trajectory

429
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,340
and figure out how to interpret it

430
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,740
in terms of your your variable your

431
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,200
state variables

432
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,799
um

433
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,740
so you can essentially you you look for

434
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,480
the

435
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,380
the probability distribution over

436
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,020
variables that optimizes the free energy

437
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,360
and that allows you to look back in time

438
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
and

439
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,179
um

440
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,760
reinterpret

441
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,919
um evidence because you get something

442
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,500
new and it you get you know in light of

443
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,000
new evidence and then some of the

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,559
earlier chapters they had this kind of

445
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,360
example and they had the example of the

446
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,080
of a dynamical a dynamic programming

447
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
kind of a a model for this so I would

448
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,240
expect that to be the case also in

449
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,280
communication

450
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,320
um systems and I guess I'm going back

451
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,380
again to communication where uh to some

452
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,780
extent you're able to reinterpret what

453
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,059
you thought you heard before

454
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,640
um you know we it's kind of rare in in

455
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,620
language but it happens there are Garden

456
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,260
Path sentences

457
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,780
um

458
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,659
but usually you know you most

459
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,919
communication systems try to be

460
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,020
relatively hierarchical in that once you

461
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,059
was once you interpret your continuous

462
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,700
value signal then you don't leave a lot

463
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,980
of ambiguity you kind of you know fix on

464
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,480
that and then you have to deal with it

465
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,860
later and sometimes you go back and do

466
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,059
repair

467
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,880
so I'm wondering if this figure 8.6 if

468
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,840
that allows that kind of Dynamics where

469
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,039
um you know you're kind of tracking

470
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
something in the continuous value level

471
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,240
you're tracking a signal why effectively

472
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,740
by making predictions of what you're

473
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,740
going to hear uh What You observe

474
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,620
um and then can is that able in this

475
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,940
framework to go and influence the symbol

476
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,659
level the uh the B you know the s

477
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,020
s variables above and how far back in

478
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,140
time is it able to do that

479
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,760
nice

480
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,940
that makes me think about phonemes down

481
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,659
here

482
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,940
and audio

483
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,360
and then here are the um

484
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,900
spellings so in a language or someone is

485
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,280
speaking unclearly or you're not super

486
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,240
familiar with the language

487
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,780
um

488
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,900
then you really are like doing inference

489
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,380
on the on the whole time series like

490
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,299
it's like that kind of

491
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,720
um retro casting which can include even

492
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,600
revisionism and and delusions and false

493
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,140
memories and all that now casting

494
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,580
including the tension between

495
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,980
representing things quote as they are

496
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,440
versus like

497
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,200
um having delusions in the present

498
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,059
and then anticipation which of course

499
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,760
hasn't even happened unless you have a

500
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,720
vision of time as you know

501
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,820
something that always was or

502
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,140
however

503
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,460
so

504
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,840
it's really

505
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,679
um

506
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,620
interesting that although this time T is

507
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,299
an index

508
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,059
we are doing inference across these

509
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,000
and maybe it would speak to some

510
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
um measure of information processing

511
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,760
and memory and anticipation

512
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,620
the extent to which

513
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,159
um

514
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,280
like meaning

515
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,899
is able to be

516
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,100
the closer meaning is to a critical

517
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,500
point like the more this graph structure

518
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,820
if someone says but I was just kidding

519
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,120
you would want that to apply to to be

520
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,080
like oh I didn't know I was in a

521
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
parenthesis and now that they were just

522
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,400
kidding about that

523
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,539
um

524
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,059
so it's actually like delineating those

525
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,419
structural markers

526
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,520
and then reinterpreting meaning

527
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,140
is

528
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,240
perhaps moving towards the kind of

529
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,080
linguistic

530
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,760
modeling

531
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,340
so yeah to come back to it

532
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,260
so this could be a waveform

533
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,360
the observables down here could could be

534
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,700
just a four-year analysis or or a pure

535
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
auditory

536
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,380
um waveform

537
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,360
yeah I think phonemes is a that's what

538
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,199
comes to mind also

539
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,200
okay

540
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,860
foreign

541
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,940
motor tasks

542
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,980
so selecting a Target location and

543
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,679
using motor Behavior functionally eyes

544
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,200
to foviate the Target

545
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,760
figure eight seven okay figure eight

546
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,799
seven

547
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:48,260
is a hybrid or mixed generative model

548
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,500
higher level is this is kind of like the

549
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,779
decision making motor active inference

550
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,679
Fusion

551
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,320
here we have a little bit of the italics

552
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,039
and bold

553
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,279
um

554
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,260
which we could dive into but don't need

555
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,059
to do so at this moment

556
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,380
so you know my recollection for last

557
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,440
week was that that corresponded to

558
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,799
um generative model versus process model

559
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,120
you think that might map again here I

560
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,260
know you didn't want to dive into it

561
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,120
yeah

562
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,200
all right

563
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,760
I believe it does let's just remind

564
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,500
ourselves where it came up earlier in

565
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,600
the chapter yeah it was the very

566
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,220
beginning

567
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,480
right here yeah with italics versus

568
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,419
process in bold model in italics

569
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,400
so eight seven

570
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,720
so now here

571
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,539
the um discrete model is on a time

572
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,600
period of 200 milliseconds

573
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,080
continuous model operates continuously

574
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,799
um I think this speaks to how

575
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,980
biological knowledge can be

576
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,460
encoded in the model structure

577
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,740
I mean a more comprehensive approach

578
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,779
would have done parameter sweeps for

579
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,400
what the optimal number of milliseconds

580
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,679
is to do a discrete model on

581
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,520
however one could say like well the

582
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,039
physiology that we're interested in is

583
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,140
accomplished with a gamma

584
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,799
EEG cycle the gamma EEG cycle is this

585
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,539
many milliseconds

586
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:40,020
so we're just going to treat

587
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,799
that as like a discrete Rhythm like one

588
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,960
can imagine if the discrete time were

589
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,659
one millisecond here

590
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,100
you would be losing computational

591
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,559
advantage and you'd be kind of like over

592
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,659
slicing

593
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,600
because if eye movement does happen on a

594
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,460
time scale of

595
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,940
hundreds of milliseconds

596
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,260
discretizing to one millisecond is going

597
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,320
to be too fine and discretizing to one

598
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,960
second is not going to enable multiple

599
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,820
actions to be taken within that frame

600
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,980
so time scale and spatial scale of a

601
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,299
system

602
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,020
might be able to be encoded

603
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,980
at the phase of its construction

604
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,380
or structured learning more generally

605
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,020
gaussian mixture model

606
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,299
and the hierarchical

607
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,760
yeah so before before we move on just

608
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,600
about the isocades

609
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,880
um I don't understand what is deemed by

610
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,059
an active inference model for this I

611
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,200
mean why not just say you got a

612
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
controller yeah it's a control Loop and

613
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,260
that's good enough

614
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,299
yes

615
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,100
in

616
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,320
um live stream number 50 which we're

617
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
just preparing for it's like very

618
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,460
classical cybernetic control Loop

619
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,720
homeostatic Dynamics

620
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,399
and um

621
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,580
it's interesting to

622
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,460
ask like again what makes the model Act

623
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,120
of inference

624
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,100
one could say that if there's a Markov

625
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,140
blanket but we're you know between every

626
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,539
one of these variables

627
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,760
it is a model of action and perception

628
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,740
like so many other models of action and

629
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,899
perception

630
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:47,959
so what is being shown here is it that

631
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,779
the single imperative the free that

632
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,220
energy-based imperatives

633
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,100
just speaking narrowly here

634
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,539
energy-based imperatives

635
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,740
can mediate

636
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,380
decision making in discrete continuous

637
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,520
Hybrid models

638
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,140
and that it's possible to have

639
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,220
a categorical decision-making model

640
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,140
in feedback

641
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,539
with A continuous ocular motor model

642
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,360
at the very least it places this type of

643
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,658
model

644
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
within the

645
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,760
domain and grammar of active inference

646
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,299
modeling

647
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,520
okay data clustering we may have touched

648
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,640
upon also a hierarchical gaussian filter

649
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,440
that I know some people have

650
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,500
worked on

651
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,440
okay let's look at some of the summary

652
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,679
advances in continuous time models

653
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,080
synthetic bird song we talked about this

654
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,100
ocular motor delays

655
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,840
conditioned reflex

656
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,020
that's okay so this is in the chapter

657
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,760
this is in the chapter

658
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,080
I don't know about this exact paper

659
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
perhaps but ocular Motors in the chapter

660
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,240
and smooth eye Pursuits

661
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,120
conditioned reflexes that is in this

662
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,399
chapter the blank the conditioned and

663
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,658
the unconditioned to stimuli

664
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,179
building on the Songbird model but the

665
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,860
Songbird model was in 2015.

666
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,539
false inference from sub-optimal prior

667
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,640
beliefs

668
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,860
can but prior beliefs be sub-optimal

669
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,799
um sorry uh actually McPherson has

670
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,640
talked about bird songs uh before 2015

671
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,519
in uh one of his papers I think from

672
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,580
2013 or 12 uh yeah it's it's from 2013

673
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,179
which is co-authored with uh his son I

674
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:49,860
guess Dominic aphriston so yeah I mean

675
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,240
2015 paper was not the first paper the

676
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,220
name of the paper is the is the free

677
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,740
energy formulation of Music generation

678
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,080
and perception thank you

679
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,299
thank you yeah

680
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:07,200
wow yeah good um find a reminder

681
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,199
interesting

682
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,599
looks very much like the textbook you

683
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,320
know opening quotes

684
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,158
I can see how this is relates here

685
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,820
researching too

686
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,899
okay

687
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,619
oh maybe even 2009 bird song chaotic

688
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,560
attractors wow you know

689
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,040
it's 10 10 plus years on

690
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,719
the bird song

691
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,618
paradigm

692
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:44,399
okay so um

693
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,859
deviations in perception

694
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,099
more eye movements

695
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,659
it's kind of fun like how we've talked

696
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,240
about babbling and that across different

697
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,599
domains like cicading

698
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,700
no there's the ocular motor cicade but

699
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,640
are there other kinds of cicadings

700
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,020
[Music]

701
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,400
um

702
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,619
for example I think that

703
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,020
Knowledge Management

704
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,680
niches facilitate semantic cicading yes

705
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,720
enabled by visual cicading as well

706
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
because you have to be like looking

707
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,839
around on the page but it's just like

708
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,000
what was chapter four

709
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,220
okay okay that's what we're talking

710
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,540
about chapter four

711
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,880
what's notation I think it's just sort

712
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,960
of like

713
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,300
the analog to scanning around a little

714
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,420
bit

715
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,640
conversational analysis that's you know

716
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,800
that's a very important topic is topic

717
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,900
control

718
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,380
and um or you know if you're uh

719
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,020
if you look at um any you know most

720
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,460
conversations have multiple threads

721
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,960
going

722
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,380
so it's like a Fugue in you know Bach

723
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,300
okay you know which voice is this are

724
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,940
you you know every note is in a voice

725
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,400
and the voice has got some topic and

726
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,180
they intertwine

727
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,220
in girdle escherbach

728
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,320
Prelude Aunt fugue

729
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,900
nice this is very um interesting I think

730
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,250
it starts to

731
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:20,700
[Music]

732
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,500
um

733
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,339
plant some seeds towards again semantic

734
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:29,180
cicading computational conversation

735
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,220
analysis and generation

736
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,700
adaptive knowledge environments

737
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,640
like visual accessibility is

738
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,940
one topic you know if somebody has um a

739
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,040
visual difference then making sure that

740
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,500
they can see it is the enabling system

741
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,660
but let's just assume that we're within

742
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,339
a space where we can talk about what is

743
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,339
being seen so then

744
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,220
um how does someone get a clear picture

745
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,920
of what we're talking about

746
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,780
that would be through some sort of

747
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,640
cicade

748
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,980
where you'd recognize

749
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,040
um more uncertainty at the periphery

750
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,980
and um like the fovea in this case is

751
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,680
paying attention to the conversation

752
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,480
and that's why like with a language

753
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,220
we're unfamiliar with we get a little

754
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,140
bit lost because like our circuit was

755
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,480
too slow we don't have the fluency to

756
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,460
cicade and so the video is moving too

757
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,540
fast

758
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,980
to track

759
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,480
so we're just kind of like randomly

760
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,680
listening and like trying to like

761
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,160
compute

762
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,260
but what if somebody were on a guided

763
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,900
cicade journey through their semantic

764
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,940
landscape

765
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,380
I mean just to take this a little bit

766
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,060
further um

767
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,820
this is also maybe uh you know it's a

768
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,500
critical element of

769
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,980
uh cognitive architecture which is the

770
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,220
ability to topic switch and you know in

771
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,200
Psychology and cognitive science we

772
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,579
there's this notion of executive control

773
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,980
and one of the fundamentals of executive

774
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,680
control is to be able to

775
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,020
topic switch so you're on some task you

776
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,940
get an interrupt you have to put that on

777
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,280
a stack deal with your interrupt then

778
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,740
when you're done and maybe the interrupt

779
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,480
is a goal it could be a sub goal it

780
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,040
could be some other topic that comes in

781
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,480
something you have to deal with then

782
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,560
when you're done you have to be able to

783
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,359
pull that back push that back off the

784
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:19,260
stack

785
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,660
and get back to where you were so all

786
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,700
that that context switching is really I

787
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,320
mean there's measures of how people do

788
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,000
this and there's debates about whether

789
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,880
people can can multitask or not whether

790
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,800
they're actually really multitasking or

791
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,260
they're just multi-threading but they're

792
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,020
there's they're dividing the amount of

793
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,240
computational process by the number of

794
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,740
processes you have going so you're

795
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,540
actually not doing multiple things at

796
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,700
once as effectively as if you just stuck

797
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,160
with one so

798
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,220
um yeah anyway and then it's like do we

799
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,599
have that Intel hyper threading capacity

800
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,260
is it a virtualized hyper thread

801
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,599
on one thread

802
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,940
are there actually different threads

803
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,040
yeah I mean the conversation analysis

804
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,720
other than us being right in the thick

805
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,118
of it and it being highly engaging

806
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,700
supported area let's just continue

807
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,800
through this cases here

808
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,079
action observation

809
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,300
okay mirror neurons

810
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,180
this may be very much related to the um

811
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,980
bird song

812
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,140
seeing from the same hymn sheet or

813
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,460
whatever and then like you know doing

814
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,339
the same dance okay attention

815
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,220
this is a super fascinating area

816
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,320
and um

817
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,420
I think a lot of notebooks and and

818
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,300
applications

819
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,000
like just taking a trace of somebody's

820
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,500
browsing on Wikipedia or across websites

821
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,079
and then reconstructing components of

822
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,700
their generative model based upon their

823
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,420
salience revealed choice is a huge area

824
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,920
and then doing again that with the

825
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,300
ocular motor with webcams

826
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,460
uh and doing it with uh

827
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,260
semantic landscapes

828
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,780
hybrid modeling self-organization

829
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,880
arguably with some

830
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,480
pretty interesting advances in the last

831
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
several months and days from Fields 11

832
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,339
others

833
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,640
on the

834
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,200
and four stage earlier but on the

835
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,118
morphogenesis as Bayesian inference

836
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,099
okay

837
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,720
in our last

838
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,339
few minutes here

839
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,020
let's just look ahead to nine because I

840
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,540
think this is setting us up well

841
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,720
um

842
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
okay

843
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,660
model-based data analysis or databased

844
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,760
modeling or however we want to say this

845
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,320
is about

846
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,780
parameterizing

847
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,980
structured models with observations

848
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,760
so rather than just by Fiat dictate

849
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,260
saying this is the structure of the

850
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,900
model and it spits out observations like

851
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,720
so and so we want to be able to actually

852
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,240
run it backwards not as a generative

853
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
model but as a recognition model

854
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,260
so to speak in this expectation

855
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,380
maximization framework and parameterize

856
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,099
our generative model from sparse or

857
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,500
dense observations and that's also

858
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,560
called parametric empirical base

859
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,740
because you're parameterizing the prior

860
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,960
based upon the mean and variance and

861
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,839
patterns of some empirical data

862
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,060
okay the metabazian approach

863
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,920
Bayes theorem

864
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:16,079
this may even be something

865
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,320
that could be introduced earlier

866
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,359
even though it's also meta

867
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,579
this is like the the map territory

868
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,220
fallacy fallacy

869
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,160
graphical abstract

870
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,339
which is we're making a map here's Us in

871
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:36,780
the bigger box even though there's a

872
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,940
dashed box even Beyond us

873
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,579
we're making a map

874
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,640
of a cognitive entity

875
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,460
in its map making of its generative

876
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,320
process

877
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,200
and that was the subject also of some

878
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,520
very rich

879
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,980
discussion several days ago with Jacob

880
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,060
and Ali and Dalton

881
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,259
Ollie anything to add on this

882
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,660
uh no nothing much but

883
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,560
um

884
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,680
uh one General comment I wanted to make

885
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,700
about uh chapter nine is that uh you see

886
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,920
because of my project that I've been

887
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,319
working on for the past several months

888
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,200
this chapter nine has been quite helpful

889
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,079
in developing some of my ideas around

890
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,520
how to uh how to exactly model my

891
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,900
um

892
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,780
am I I mean the music emotional

893
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,940
recognition system that I've been

894
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,599
working on but I wanted to point out uh

895
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,339
one small caveat here uh which is that

896
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,400
uh you see at least in my opinion

897
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,660
chapter nine or uh this so-called model

898
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,400
based data analysis uh it's not a

899
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,000
conducive to

900
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,619
generate

901
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:11,640
every I mean on every model that's been

902
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,740
described throughout the throughout the

903
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,280
book I mean it's just focused on some

904
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,940
specific kinds of models so it might not

905
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,660
be generalizable to every kind of model

906
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,000
that we've seen throughout all the

907
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,780
previous chapters

908
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,720
good point some

909
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,740
models might be just plug and play

910
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,660
so to speak and other ones might take a

911
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,020
little bit more work to get to use

912
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,740
empirically

913
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,819
okay let's just continue in our last

914
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,099
minute so scan through so metabasian

915
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,200
process we're drawing inferences about

916
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,399
an inferential process

917
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,140
it's a key

918
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,660
point and that's the two levels of

919
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,640
mapping it's like the map of the map

920
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,880
variational LaPlace

921
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
variational Bays

922
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,480
factorized

923
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,220
models

924
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,200
for computational Simplicity and

925
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
interpretability

926
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,000
based upon the sparsity of coupling of

927
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,400
variables in a base graph

928
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,440
and LaPlace

929
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,060
using a parabolic approximator

930
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,480
of the mode and a variance

931
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,540
to ensure

932
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,900
a simple optimizable heuristic

933
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,660
not that it perfectly recapitulates the

934
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,300
shape of the posterior which doesn't

935
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,240
have to be inverted quadratic

936
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,880
but the LaPlace approximation

937
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,520
is smoothly optimizable for both the

938
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,920
mode and the variance

939
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,480
and here's where they mentioned that's

940
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,160
the parametric empirical Bayesian

941
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,180
approach

942
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,180
and basically LaPlace approximation can

943
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,740
be thought of as making a commitment to

944
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,380
um the quadratic form

945
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,500
so choosing the family that your prior

946
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,700
is going to be of and then bootstrapping

947
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,800
your initial prior

948
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,319
with your observed data

949
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,940
bootstrapping not in the resampling

950
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,880
sense but in the starting oneself out

951
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,220
sense

952
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,259
um this was explored more

953
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,420
in other

954
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,400
works

955
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,680
but you have some likelihood function of

956
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,099
all the parameters L of data

957
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,880
and

958
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:53,660
optimizing action

959
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,618
involves Computing beliefs about policy

960
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,780
such that policies are proportionally

961
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,700
taking up slices of the pie

962
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,359
monotonically

963
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,119
with respect to their free energy

964
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,119
and then there's a Precision on action

965
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,260
parameter

966
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,940
where you can turn it all the way down

967
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,280
to sort of like don't know don't care

968
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,260
where even large differences in free

969
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,440
energy between policies get equilibrated

970
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,940
out

971
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,060
that's like hot decision making and then

972
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,760
absolute zero decision making would be a

973
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,099
policy that's even 51 percent more

974
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:36,420
likely

975
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,780
would be always selected

976
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,800
so

977
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,839
the variational free energy expected

978
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:46,079
free energy it's abound on surprise

979
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,359
due to Jensen's inequality and evidence

980
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,040
lower bound and all this other work in

981
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,660
variational inference

982
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,400
and then that

983
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,560
pie slicing

984
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,940
can be

985
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,740
tuned up or down with a shaky hand

986
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,079
parameter

987
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,880
soft Max temperature parameter

988
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,380
if the Soft Max is one

989
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,760
the pie is undistorted

990
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,160
if the Soft Max is large

991
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,520
you have a Relentless bias

992
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,520
for better policies

993
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,839
or it could be less than one

994
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,640
here's some technical details of the

995
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,540
LaPlace approximation

996
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,579
parametric empirical base

997
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,400
generalized linear modeling

998
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,400
#spm

999
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,300
here's recipe so this is kind of like

1000
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,040
chapter six but now it's model based

1001
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,460
data analysis collect behavioral data

1002
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,079
maybe the data's already been collected

1003
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,700
maybe there's some data sets that we

1004
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,400
already already can use

1005
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,380
formulate a pmdp

1006
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,599
I wonder if this is as chapter six not

1007
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,520
as chapter 7.

1008
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,260
it could be chapter seven as well if

1009
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,040
it's discrete time

1010
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:15,359
specify likelihood

1011
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,520
perhaps we can um in the coming weeks

1012
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,220
check out SPM mdp vbx

1013
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:26,720
and they mentioned the scripts

1014
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,319
data this is nice

1015
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,300
this will be fun

1016
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,920
chapter seven I mean it is the correct

1017
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,920
if they're using this type

1018
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,380
four

1019
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,839
chapter seven chapter four

1020
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,740
so

1021
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,700
this looks pretty cool pretty

1022
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,619
interesting we could walk through some

1023
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,460
examples

1024
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,200
false inference

1025
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,460
computational pathology

1026
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,800
so it kind of ends like chapter eight

1027
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,760
with a table of references and a summary

1028
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,380
so it's a pretty short chapter

1029
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,260
and

1030
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,079
has some formalisms

1031
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,819
but it's only from page 179 of the PDF

1032
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,819
to

1033
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:33,440
196. so it's less than 20 pages

1034
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,200
and the next chapter I think is the

1035
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,359
longest chapter in the book which one is

1036
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,160
chapter 10 chapter 10 197.

1037
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,000
yeah that one's over 30 pages

1038
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,780
but it ends on a high note

1039
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,359
um

1040
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:03,599
all right well

1041
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,520
interesting

1042
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,760
conversations thanks for this

1043
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,020
we will come

1044
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:15,660
um back to chapter nine

1045
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,260
look through it and then peep into 10.

1046
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,140
go through 10 and really solidify our

1047
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,799
understanding

1048
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,240
of the map and I guess indirectly of the

1049
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,740
territory

1050
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,980
and then for those who want to join

1051
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,140
will probably continue the discussion

1052
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,260
and um especially start looking towards

1053
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,960
those project ideas again like we talked

1054
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,819
just a little earlier about making a DOT

1055
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,160
zero

1056
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,540
um

1057
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,339
a DOT zero sessions for the textbook

1058
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:52,980
so I I have to apologize I'm I'm

1059
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,720
traveling for a few weeks so I'm gonna

1060
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,099
miss the next

1061
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,380
um several sessions

1062
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,780
it's all good thank you Eric

1063
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,520
um any other comments people want to

1064
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,960
make or I'll close the recording

1065
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,859
okay

1066
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,400
thank you
