1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,680
hello everyone it is june 9 2022

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,440
and it's

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,280
chapter three

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,719
week one

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,719
and it's the first cohort of the

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
textbook group

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,199
we're gonna go to the questions

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,760
uh there weren't any ideas added for

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,160
three but if people have any key themes

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
or any ideas that they picked up on with

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,640
three they can add them here

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,840
otherwise we'll go to the

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,700
questions and

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,640
[Music]

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
also if people have questions in the

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
chat or

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
it would be also great just to take

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,640
notes

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,559
or add questions and continue to upload

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,440
them

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,960
and then next week we'll continue the

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
discussion on three

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,520
so

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,960
this is just the

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
opening set of questions

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,480
maybe just the first

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,160
ideas of the book turning two questions

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,760
now that we've

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,199
at least

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,359
gone through chapter two once and part

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,960
of chapter three or the whole thing of

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
chapter three

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
what is the high road to active

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
inference

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320
what does anyone think about the high

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,400
road to active inference

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,280
or

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,119
about this low road high road

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,400
construct

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
that is used in chapters two and three

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
just broadly how did the approach of

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
chapter three feel different than the

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,479
approach or the topics of chapter two

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,119
um jf and then ali

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
well i i just want to make the bill

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
comment that the the the the high road

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
approach is what uh first grabbed me

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
when i encountered the free energy

49
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,840
principle that that what really

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,199
fascinated me that there was an attempt

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,080
at the

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,239
a unifying answer to uh

53
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,760
self-organization uh

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
cognition

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,480
um

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
and

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,319
that this could all be brought together

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,599
uh around some relatively uh

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,319
a sparse number of of concepts that's

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
what grabbed me much more than the low

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
road

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,640
thank you

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,839
ali and then ben

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
well yeah uh reading chapter three

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,879
actually clarified uh my previously held

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,040
in fact wrong belief that

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
uh i

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,440
previously i thought that a low road was

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
a kind of

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
uh bottom-up approach and the high road

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
is a top-down approach but uh now i see

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
that

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
low road was basically

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
uh tackling the problem of

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
active inference from the inferential

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
point of view and from the statistical

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,080
and inferential point of view but uh in

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
the high road

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
uh we have a much more

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,159
general generalized and much more

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
let's say all-encompassing

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,680
uh

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
view to tackle the problem of active

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
inference namely

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,560
uh

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,599
by way of defining markup blankets and

87
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,640
all the properties of living organisms

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,799
and so on

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,640
awesome thank you

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
ben and then anyone else who raises

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
their hand and also you can take notes

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
on this ideas the book like high road

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,840
generally ben and then mike

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
yeah i think uh

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,959
i think for me as well the height this

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
chapter three in the high road has been

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,519
um an easier road in and i the thing

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,360
that i noticed about it was it seems to

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
me so so they say in the introduction

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
that active inference is a normative

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
theory i feel like the high road to me

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
feels there's much more normativity

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,959
in the high road is that it's an account

104
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,920
of what organisms have to do and i think

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
compared to the previous

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,040
compared to the previous chapter i think

107
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
chapter 2

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,519
felt a lot more

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
descriptive for me i'm not sure other

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,600
people would maybe that's just the way

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
that i was reading it but it

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
it felt like chapter three was a lot

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
more kind of it had a more normative

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
force to it that i i really enjoyed

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,198
thank you bye

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
there we go

117
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
sorry

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
my computer was not responding

119
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,400
uh so i went through a similar

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
experience as ali described in terms of

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
going into it thinking about bottoms up

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,320
and top down and coming out of it

123
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
thinking about it differently

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
um

125
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
but i feel like in chapter three there's

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
still a lot to unpack around the markov

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
blanket so

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,479
that is still

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
capturing this inferential nature of

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,240
things

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
it still has a bayesian quality like

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
what we saw in chapter two

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,919
um

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
but it also for me at least it still

135
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
feels a bit opaque at this point in

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
terms of

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,240
um

138
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
this sort of indirect influence that's

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
taking place across the markov blanket

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
awesome

141
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
okay

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
any other comments otherwise we're going

143
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
to go to the questions and and we'll

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,479
approach many of those topics

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,639
okay

146
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,759
first question

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
regarding the markov blanket explanation

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,080
on page 43 and box 3.1

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
they write no additional information

150
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
about the future is gained by finding

151
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,160
out about the past assuming we know the

152
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,560
present how can this be true that's one

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
question

154
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
they write

155
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
they define regarding

156
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
the markov blanket as

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
the set of variables that mediate all

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
statistical interactions between a

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
system and its environment

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,720
what is a statistical rather than a

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
non-statistical interaction

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,759
they write that they have supplemented

163
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,280
conditional independencies with

164
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,360
dynamical constraints

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
so that the flows do not depend upon

166
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
states on the opposite side of the

167
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,919
blanket

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,680
why does independence between the flows

169
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
on the two sides of the blanket matter

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
so much

171
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
all right

172
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,080
great so

173
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
who would like to give a thought on this

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
first question how can it be true about

175
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
markov blankets that no additional

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
information about the future is gained

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,159
by finding out about the past

178
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
so i added a note in there you can tell

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,599
me if this is correct or not

180
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,479
with regard to markov chains that as i

181
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,319
understand the markov chain

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,960
in its present state is effectively

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
capturing all the information about the

184
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
past so

185
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,960
i

186
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
assume that translates into the markov

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
blanket

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,599
yes

189
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,319
um great comment and a markov chain is

190
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,440
is a

191
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,400
uh

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
used very broadly

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,319
and

194
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,800
just to give one example it's like

195
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
the current state of the chess board

196
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
knowing more about previous moves

197
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
doesn't tell you more about the future

198
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
and so it's like it's a one markov chain

199
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,479
because the dependency is only about

200
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,199
that one time step now if it were to

201
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
violate that condition

202
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
of being a one markov blanket through

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,800
time

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
and have like a three markov blanket

205
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,039
that would mean that the same board

206
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,840
position depending on what move happened

207
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
three before

208
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,599
was still having some influence on how

209
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,280
the system evolved

210
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
that wouldn't violate the markovian

211
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
property it would just make it a

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,479
different kind of markov chain

213
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
and that is commonly used in the

214
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
temporal modeling like in time series

215
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,799
modeling

216
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,679
and in

217
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,880
like transitions of stochastic processes

218
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,479
the markov blanket is abstracting it

219
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,440
from

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
this like time sequence idea like the

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
now is a blanket between the past and

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
the future

223
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
and we could think about spatial systems

224
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,320
um

225
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,160
like a newton's cradle or something like

226
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
that

227
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
as well as like spatial temporal systems

228
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
or just abstract causal systems

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
um so how can this be true it's true by

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
definition because that's what the

231
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
definition of a markov blanket is

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
whether that description

233
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
is adequate

234
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
or maps on to carving nature of the

235
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,279
joints and all these other things are

236
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,120
um respectively

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
statistical model comparison and

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,600
ontological philosophical questions but

239
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
it's true by definition about markov

240
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,640
blankets lyle

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
yeah i mean i think you actually you

242
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
just pretty much covered it but i would

243
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,279
just say this is the same condition if

244
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
you're building rl models of you know

245
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,839
different kinds of autonomous systems

246
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
this is the same restriction

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,880
i think your comment about the nested

248
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
the nested

249
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
blankets is interesting because

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
in the rl space you know we we typically

251
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
don't have that kind of richness but

252
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
what we do then would be

253
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
for example we want to know that just

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,640
and in that case we would just create a

255
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
you basically create a state variable

256
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
which is the

257
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
the pro you know the

258
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
the history of the

259
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
uh of the state transition so we fudge

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
it a little bit but your your

261
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
explanation that

262
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,079
in in

263
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
in this conception with nested markov

264
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
blankets then that that would be the

265
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
more comprehensive solution to that

266
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
issue

267
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
thanks just to kind of clarify there

268
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,079
like one hack or work around would be

269
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,720
like you make the list of all of the

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,040
last possible three moves

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
and then you make a one markov blanket

272
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
with all the last combinations of three

273
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,839
so it still uses the machinery of a one

274
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
markov chain which has the simplest

275
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
transition matrix

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
but it could encompass the last states

277
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
but it sort of compresses them into a

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
one markov chain format

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
yeah i mean very often you want to know

280
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
the you know cross you want to know the

281
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,040
lat the average of the last you know 20

282
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
time steps yeah you're just trying to

283
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,519
smooth something right

284
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
and it's just way too much work to build

285
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
all that machinery in there so you

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
you make you make that average actually

287
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
a present variable is what you do

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
great example if something really does

289
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,279
depend on the last 20 time steps or you

290
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
want to do model comparison as to

291
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
whether it's a better model that is

292
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
conditioned on the last 15 or 20 or 30

293
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
um you can just

294
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
condense it with summary statistics and

295
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
descriptions again into this one markov

296
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,560
framework otherwise the combinatorics of

297
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
how the 20 influence each other is vast

298
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,399
brock

299
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,800
i guess that's related to it like my

300
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
comment was just going to be that um the

301
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
way they worded it

302
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
if you're not

303
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
rigidly thinking about us

304
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,279
singular markov blanket

305
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,639
that

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,160
you know i mean

307
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
if just just practically speaking

308
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
finding out about the past

309
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
usually does give you information about

310
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
the future if you're talking about

311
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
outside of a singular marketplace right

312
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
so um

313
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
if you you know adding the words um

314
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
no additional information like uh about

315
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
the mark of you know about the future of

316
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
the markov blanket is gained by finding

317
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
out about the past the markov blanket

318
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,440
like kind of you know bounds that but um

319
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
in the case of like the machine learning

320
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
example and comparing models you're

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
talking necessarily talking about a much

322
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
larger archive blanket than just a

323
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,320
singular one there right so

324
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,959
that's just the same thing

325
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
yes and just like many concepts have

326
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,399
like a broader

327
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
conversational informal sense and a

328
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
narrow more technical sense assuming we

329
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
know the present means fully knowing the

330
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
presence fully knowing the blanket so

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
it's like but i could still learn things

332
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
about the past so that's not to say that

333
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,200
there isn't novel information that you

334
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
could discover about the past like you

335
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
could still go back in that chess game

336
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,200
and learn information so it's not that

337
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
there isn't information in the past

338
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
it's not that it wouldn't even be

339
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
interesting it's that for the purposes

340
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,920
of how the present goes into the next

341
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
time step

342
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
the present blanket in this temporal

343
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
markov chain which is like a blanket

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
through time

345
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,240
it contains the information you need

346
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
for the transition frequencies

347
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
um okay

348
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
they define that it's the set of

349
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,519
variables that mediate

350
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,199
all and also the markov blanket um

351
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,360
using last names

352
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,240
you know

353
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
personal opinion is not

354
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
helpful because not only are there

355
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,040
multiple markovs but the markovian

356
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
property is not something that's

357
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
technical or defined

358
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,800
so

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,839
maybe

360
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,199
someday we'll have better ways to

361
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,040
describe and be more specific that don't

362
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
involve invoking

363
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,680
ambiguity around names

364
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,279
that being said

365
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
it was worked out analytically by

366
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
markov and sun

367
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
and others

368
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
but most recently it was pearl 1988 and

369
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,240
causal inference with bayesian

370
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
perspective so this is not like an act

371
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
of inference ism it's drawing upon a

372
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,240
total

373
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
bayesian statistical framework

374
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
any base graph that's not fully

375
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,279
connected

376
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,199
is going to have some nodes

377
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
that intermediate so that's going to

378
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,560
relate to this question

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,480
so what is a statistical rather than a

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
non-statistical interaction

381
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,959
ali and then anyone else who would like

382
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,920
to address that

383
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,120
well i think it has something to do with

384
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
the way uh these interactions are

385
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
parameterized and modeled because you

386
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
see every phenomenon

387
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,199
can be

388
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,320
parameterized and modeled uh from

389
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
many different many various perspectives

390
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,399
and

391
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
frameworks within various frameworks

392
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
but here and the reason i think they put

393
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,680
the term statistical in parentheses is

394
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
that they mean that

395
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,360
these variables mediate all interactions

396
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,279
that have been parameterized

397
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,639
statistically

398
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,000
so the i think it's

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,839
it refers to the nature

400
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,839
of

401
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,639
parameterizing and modeling these

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
interactions

403
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,480
as opposed to

404
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,839
distinguishing between inter statistical

405
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,920
and non-statistical

406
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,920
interactions

407
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,759
all right

408
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
so anyone else can raise their hand but

409
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,240
just here's a few thoughts on that

410
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
um a statistical interaction is the edge

411
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,040
in a causal bayes graph

412
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,279
and people might be more familiar or

413
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
have seen like structural equation

414
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
modeling where nodes are variables and

415
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
edges are the correlation

416
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
between or among variables

417
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,199
conditioning on the structure of the

418
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
graph

419
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,759
um in the causal bayes graph the nodes

420
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,519
are variables and the edges are

421
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
statistical causal influences so

422
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
causality and statistics is not always

423
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,000
the same as what people mean by cause in

424
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
the real world

425
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,839
but like granger causality

426
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,759
and just this notion of like coarse

427
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,639
graining and cause

428
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
it may line up

429
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,399
with

430
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,959
the sort of narrative natural language

431
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,199
description that somebody has

432
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,240
between

433
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,440
when they're speaking it might be

434
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
narrower than that it might be a

435
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,839
different thing than that it might be

436
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,839
more general than that

437
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,240
um would a non-statistical interaction

438
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,120
be i mean

439
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,519
there's various ways to approach that

440
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,600
it's kind of pointing towards some sort

441
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
of

442
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
like a touch could be an interaction

443
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
but what if things are touching but

444
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
those variables don't

445
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,319
change as a function of their touching

446
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,599
then do those things interact or not

447
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
that's one question

448
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
and then cause there's like just

449
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
tremendous

450
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,119
real world and philosophy questions like

451
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
what causes what what's the difference

452
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,640
making cause what's the cause that makes

453
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
a difference

454
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,559
necessity insufficiency

455
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,160
there's so many

456
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
questions in this like causal philosophy

457
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,200
and this is highlighting

458
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
we're talking about the model

459
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
we made a base graph with height weight

460
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
and shirt color

461
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,320
and here are the statistical effectors

462
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,840
and so we're not saying that there's no

463
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
interaction between this and that in the

464
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
real world now we're within the model

465
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
and we're talking about the causal graph

466
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
and again unless the base graph is fully

467
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,600
connected

468
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
there's going to be some

469
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,120
partitioning scheme that will result in

470
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
some set of nodes

471
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
being conditionally independent from

472
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
another set of nodes

473
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,880
when conditioned upon a blanket so it's

474
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
not like features of the real world or

475
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
even variables in a statistical equation

476
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
can just be unilaterally tagged as

477
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,799
blanket states

478
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
it's always a partition that

479
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,799
co-instantiates

480
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
two sides

481
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
internal and external but there's a

482
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,600
symmetry

483
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
and the blanket

484
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
so it's not like features of the world

485
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
or even features of the model are

486
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
intrinsically internal external or

487
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,480
blanket states

488
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
but that's a partitioning scheme that

489
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
can be applied

490
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,559
to base graphs of like a vast

491
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,960
various structures of bayes graphs

492
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
and bayes graphs can be applied to a

493
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,200
vast number of real world situations

494
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
and many many papers and live streams

495
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
discuss like sort of like

496
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
all-encompassing markovian modeism

497
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,240
markov blankets all the way down nested

498
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
markov blankets are the world

499
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
ranging to the critical perspectives

500
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
um

501
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
not necessarily detractors but just

502
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,400
those who believe that the usage of the

503
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,799
concept is uh

504
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
out of alignment with ways that people

505
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
have used it

506
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
mike and then anyone else

507
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
so does it make sense to think of a

508
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,280
markov blanket

509
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
in the context of an internal agent

510
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
state and an external environment is the

511
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,960
markov blanket serving as this kind of a

512
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,000
decoupling component because of

513
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,400
the way that things are conditionally

514
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
independent

515
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,400
based on the variables inside the

516
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
blanket

517
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,840
what do people think

518
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,480
yes

519
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
i mean for the internal state to be

520
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
different than the external state or

521
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,960
have some other equilibrium other

522
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,880
non-equilibrium state that the external

523
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
environment is is in

524
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,480
you would have to necessarily have

525
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,559
i'm not sure if decoupling is the right

526
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
word but some sort of conditional

527
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,840
dependent independent sort of

528
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,400
zone that separates those two regions

529
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
so here's figure 31 thank you brock

530
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
the active and the sensory states

531
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,520
compose the blanket

532
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
now

533
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
in various like live streams and papers

534
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
the history of the concept again from

535
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
the analytical pre-computational

536
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
phrasing

537
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,679
of insulation of fluctuation of random

538
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,799
variables

539
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,159
to pearls bayesian and computational

540
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,880
framing however pearl's markov blanket

541
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,840
concept doesn't have a delineation of

542
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,159
active and sensory states

543
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
it's only like there's one kind of

544
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
fabric in that blanket it's just blanket

545
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,200
states

546
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
fristen

547
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,679
maybe this is also will be shown to be

548
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,880
traced to other places and ways but

549
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
one of the core things that fristen at

550
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,679
all have brought into the picture

551
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,159
was interpreting within the blanket

552
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,200
states

553
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
the states that have incoming

554
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
dependencies to the system of interest

555
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,159
as sensory

556
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,919
and then the states that have outgoing

557
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
dependencies from the system of interest

558
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
as active states

559
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
so

560
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
people may already see

561
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,880
like challenges and complexities that

562
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,919
arise

563
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,480
with the arrows and the directions

564
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
and a lot of that is addressed in the

565
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
how particular is the free energy

566
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,039
principle

567
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,799
of aguilera at all

568
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,159
and um

569
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,200
so

570
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
we're going to continue talking about

571
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,520
this

572
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,600
entity partitioning

573
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,639
ali and then lyle

574
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
uh well i think uh we should point

575
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,760
to a very

576
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,880
important typo typographical error in

577
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,600
this

578
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,840
picture here because uh in this figure

579
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
active states are expressed in terms of

580
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,320
external states and markup blankets and

581
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,280
sensory states are expressed in terms of

582
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,000
internal states and markup blankets

583
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,480
but it should be vice versa i mean

584
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,280
the flows of internal active states are

585
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,919
independent of external states and the

586
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,200
flows of external and sensory states do

587
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,640
not depend on internal states so we

588
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,919
should change

589
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,120
x and mu in those

590
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,760
two equations

591
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,520
yes sometimes with a um possible

592
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,159
typo like that it's like it's it's so

593
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
egregious slash blatant

594
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
that it's challenging to even know but

595
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,880
we can absolutely um

596
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,559
ask the authors but just to like read

597
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,960
the equation and think about why it is

598
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,559
that way

599
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,640
the dot is the rate of change of a

600
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
variable so the internal states are mu

601
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
and so this is the rate of change of

602
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
internal states rate of change of

603
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
external states x and the rate of change

604
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,760
of u the active states and y the sensory

605
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,640
states so we're looking at how these

606
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,440
partitioned states in a bayes graph

607
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
change through time

608
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
the states that are the blanket and the

609
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
internal

610
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
are the particular states

611
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
those are referring to the particle

612
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
that's like figure versus ground the

613
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
particle that's moving around the

614
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,480
curious particle the active entity

615
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
is the particular states that is

616
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,720
partitioning the thing

617
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
literally the thing

618
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960
away from the niche

619
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,720
then there's the blanket states that are

620
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
intermediating that interface and then

621
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
we'll also talk about autonomous states

622
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
which are just the internal and the

623
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
active states

624
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
so the equation is saying the rate of

625
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
change in for example active states

626
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
is a flow function f and a noise

627
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,520
function

628
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,159
both the flow and the noise function the

629
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,799
subscript is referring to like that one

630
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,440
it's kind of like ipso in latin like

631
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,360
it's the flow on mu and the noise on mu

632
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,480
the flow

633
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
which is what the principle of least

634
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
action converges us towards

635
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,120
in the limit when the statistical

636
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,960
fluctuations from the omega are low

637
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
is a function of

638
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
certain variables

639
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
and so this is saying the flow

640
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
of active states

641
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
is a function of

642
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
external

643
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,039
sensory

644
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
and active states

645
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,640
however as ali has pointed to

646
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,279
the arguments that should be

647
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,240
guiding the flow of active states

648
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,720
are actually the blanket states and

649
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,400
internal states

650
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,760
not external states and then analogously

651
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
sensory states should have a flow that's

652
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,799
defined in terms of blanket states

653
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,039
and external states

654
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,080
not internal states

655
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
um lyell and then ali

656
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,000
yeah so actually i think you're getting

657
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,360
right right at the question at hand

658
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
because i was confused about the the

659
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
bi-directional arrows particularly

660
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
between internal states and active

661
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,120
states right

662
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
and

663
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,679
and i think

664
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,000
you're drilling right into that i still

665
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,880
don't

666
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,400
completely understand what that picture

667
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,080
should look like

668
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,200
uh but i i have trouble

669
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,279
conceptually i sort of get a conception

670
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,200
i feel like i get the markov blanket but

671
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
that representation i have trouble

672
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,159
working through the details on that

673
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,279
cool so um guest stream number seven

674
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
how particular is the physics of the

675
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,279
free energy principle

676
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,000
it explores different

677
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,260
um

678
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,360
[Music]

679
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,520
entity niche causal relationships

680
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,919
like for example we could imagine

681
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,919
a simple around-the-clock

682
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,360
entity model

683
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
external states induce sensory states

684
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
one directional arrow

685
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
sensory goes into internal internal to

686
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
active active to external like an ooda

687
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,159
loop or something like that but just in

688
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,880
around the clock no bi-directionality no

689
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,200
connection between active and sensory

690
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
but

691
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,679
given this partitioning one could

692
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
imagine that topology of cause

693
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,960
one could imagine all kinds of

694
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
topologies of cause some that violate

695
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
the markov blanket condition

696
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,520
like internal states and external states

697
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,039
that are um

698
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,039
no longer internal and external because

699
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,120
they would have a causal link but even

700
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,840
preserving the markov blanket condition

701
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
we can imagine different

702
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
topologies different sparsities of

703
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
couplings between these different states

704
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,039
a bi-directional arrow is kind of like

705
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,679
there would be a non-zero cause

706
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,240
and in the other side of the matrix

707
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,559
it would also be a non-zero cause

708
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
versus a unidirectional relationship

709
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,039
where like variable two has a causal

710
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,480
influence on three but three doesn't

711
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,880
have it on two

712
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,760
in this paper um in guest room 7.1 and

713
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
and that paper and further line of

714
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
research

715
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
they explore

716
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,520
what

717
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
sparse coupling structures

718
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,159
causal architectures of the entity niche

719
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,399
relationship and interface

720
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
would grant different statistical

721
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,399
capacities so

722
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,880
um i could be wrong on this

723
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,679
but active inference is not a commitment

724
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,480
to this specific

725
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
coupling architecture

726
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
it may be possible to design or describe

727
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,799
or imagine systems

728
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,720
that have different causal architectures

729
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
maybe even

730
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,159
true at this basal most kernel loop

731
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,080
but certainly true when we start

732
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,559
thinking about nested structures

733
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,880
and cognitive structures and so on

734
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
um so yes it is a little unfortunate

735
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
about this

736
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
however um

737
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,559
like

738
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,240
this is just thinking about causal

739
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
relationships

740
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,360
of the particular partition

741
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,799
and we're describing statistical

742
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,600
relationships here causal influence as

743
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,520
inferred from like time series data with

744
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,159
grainger causality or other methods

745
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,960
on specific random variables

746
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
so this is not the conversational notion

747
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,000
of cause like but what i'm thinking

748
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
is eventually resulting in things

749
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,760
happening in the outside world

750
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,559
or aren't things in the outside world

751
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,120
eventually changing things yes

752
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
but just like the chessboard through

753
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
time

754
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
the blanket

755
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,840
is statistically

756
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,039
intermediating and again that's why it

757
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,559
gets so messy

758
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,360
with the application of like well the

759
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,200
retina must be the sense

760
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,600
states

761
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,760
if one can read that example

762
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,120
and

763
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,600
not fall into the quicksand it could be

764
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,120
didactic

765
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,159
but

766
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,240
to tag retina as sense state

767
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,559
is like the tip of the iceberg of

768
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,000
a partially specified model

769
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
often one where the measurements have

770
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,640
not actually occurred and so on so then

771
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,960
that can be extremely difficult for

772
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,399
those with less familiarity with the

773
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,600
formalism to generalize accurately from

774
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,039
because shouldn't it be like you know

775
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,640
retina sense states and then like the

776
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,279
arm is the active state but

777
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,520
it's a partitioning that co-instantiates

778
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,679
and it's model dependence it's not

779
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,120
describing features of the real world

780
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,520
ollie

781
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,320
uh yeah i just wanted to point uh

782
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
one of

783
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,480
uh

784
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,600
ram said at all's um recent

785
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
fascinating paper on bayesian mechanics

786
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
which i put the link

787
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,799
in the chat and in that paper especially

788
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,320
in section three

789
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,799
they have a very

790
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,159
illuminating discussion about these

791
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,360
whole business of uh partitioning and

792
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,159
markup blankets and uh one sentence

793
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,520
that's uh

794
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
pretty relevant to our discussion here

795
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
is that the key point to note is that

796
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,360
the flow of internal and active

797
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
components

798
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,360
i.e their trajectory through state space

799
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,480
does not depend upon external components

800
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
and reciprocally

801
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,159
the flow of external and sensory states

802
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,360
or paths

803
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,080
does not depend upon internal states or

804
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,279
paths from page 15. so

805
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,880
yeah in that

806
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,600
if

807
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,760
you refer to that article

808
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,399
it has been elaborated much explicitly

809
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,519
also

810
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,559
in four days we will have

811
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,880
dalton and maxwell at all for a guest

812
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
stream

813
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
the paper just came out now we'll be

814
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,919
able to

815
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,039
have a discussion with them and um

816
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,279
learn and ask them questions so like if

817
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,880
people have suggestions for guest

818
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,559
streams

819
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
that can be accomplished if people want

820
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
to facilitate or participate in

821
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,919
different streams if they have questions

822
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,080
for different streams

823
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,919
being there live but especially getting

824
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,120
involved eagerly and actively and early

825
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,039
is the biggest leverage point

826
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
because that allows us to design the

827
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
material so that it's like permanently

828
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,600
useful

829
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,279
rather than potentially

830
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,279
ad hoc questions that arise during which

831
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,559
can be super important and um hopefully

832
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,760
people can see

833
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,480
some affordances for participation and

834
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,840
development

835
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,919
um let's just get to this last question

836
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,159
and it's it's like we have other

837
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,240
questions but these are essential and

838
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,840
it's one of the

839
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,519
opening formalisms of the chapter

840
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,559
um

841
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,440
just

842
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,799
to conclude here though why does

843
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,320
independence between the flows on the

844
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,840
two sides of the blanket matter so much

845
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
these are good things to

846
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
think about um just one short thought

847
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,240
would be without independence between

848
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
the flows

849
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
there is no distinguishing one thing

850
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,519
from another

851
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,919
ali

852
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
and also i think it relates to the uh

853
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,159
what we uh read in chapter two about

854
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,279
hidden states because uh that's what the

855
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,200
word hidden probably refers to i mean

856
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
internal state does not have uh direct

857
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,480
access to external states and vice versa

858
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
so

859
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
that markup blanket pretty much

860
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,399
formalizes uh this hiddenness

861
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,679
yes

862
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,279
awesome and um partially observable

863
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,559
models of the bayesian type

864
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,240
which are used in like partially

865
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,039
observable markov decision processes

866
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,360
expectation maximization any kind of

867
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,679
bayesian priors and hyper priors and so

868
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,559
on

869
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
all of these

870
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
have bayes graphs

871
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,320
that reflect conditionally independent

872
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
variables

873
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,799
so it's not that they're independent

874
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,880
in a conversational way like they don't

875
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,679
have any way of communicating

876
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,480
it's that they are specifically involved

877
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,720
in a causal network that has conditional

878
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
independence

879
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,159
but we'll hopefully develop more answers

880
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,760
and notes here we'll move on

881
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,399
what is the um differences between and

882
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,320
among the terms bayesian brain

883
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,679
hypothesis

884
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,679
predictive processing predictive coding

885
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,080
and active inference might you be able

886
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,919
to suggest references or resources for

887
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,159
where these distinctions are delineated

888
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,600
sure

889
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,519
so anyone can add more but here's i

890
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,560
think two key resources here

891
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,040
the first is livestream 43.

892
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,119
in 43.0 maria gave a really excellent

893
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,239
overview

894
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,040
of

895
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,480
predictive processing and predictive

896
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,199
coding from a historical perspective

897
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,440
and briefly she proposed that predictive

898
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,079
coding can refer to a uni-directional

899
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
data encoding scheme

900
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,119
of the kind that we see in signal

901
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,000
processing video compression so on

902
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,320
whereas predictive processing is

903
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
referring to a bi-directional

904
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,520
architecture where predictive coding is

905
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,800
implemented

906
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,760
in this ongoing top-down bottom-up way

907
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,239
bayesian brain hypothesis was also

908
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,239
touched on and we connected this to

909
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,280
active inference but 43.0 is a long

910
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,119
technical review paper but we have three

911
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,040
discussions on it predictive coding

912
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,760
theoretical experimental review

913
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,200
recent paper

914
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,960
very um good source for the um

915
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,280
predictive processing and coding

916
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,359
and predictive processing and coding

917
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,320
initially was more of about a sensory

918
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,720
framework however

919
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,280
at the end of that paper they show okay

920
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,400
now we're going to do predictive

921
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
processing on action it's active

922
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
inference

923
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,440
so predictive processing about action

924
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,520
is

925
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,000
six of one and half dozen of another

926
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
within a margin of reasonable

927
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
approximation

928
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,240
similar but there's also some key

929
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,280
differences

930
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,160
like

931
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,839
reliance on different

932
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,839
formalisms but these are all things for

933
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,079
us to explore and unpack as we work on

934
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,160
the ontology and so on

935
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,240
um

936
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
specifically

937
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,040
predictive coding active inference in

938
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,800
the bayesian brain

939
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,720
this is an interview that

940
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,400
a departed colleague

941
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,680
and i

942
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,480
did with carl fursten in 2018

943
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,119
and we specifically asked the bayesian

944
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,960
brain hypothesis predictive coding and

945
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,640
the free energy principle are often

946
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
equated with one another

947
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,000
you yourself has suggested that the

948
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,599
three frameworks are variations of the

949
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,599
same basic mechanisms

950
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,640
so 2018 was a very different time

951
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,200
active inference had not been delineated

952
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,240
from

953
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,880
fep in the same way that it is coming to

954
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,000
be now and there was a lot of other

955
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,119
differences

956
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
between that and now but he gives an

957
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,040
extended answer

958
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,280
so for people who want to learn about

959
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,240
that his extended answer

960
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
and martin's restatements of the

961
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
bayesian brain hypothesis

962
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,560
are still some of the best places to

963
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,759
find clarity on that issue

964
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,599
does anyone have any other

965
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,480
thoughts or questions on this

966
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
just one other note while anyone can

967
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
raise their hand is like the bayesian

968
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,160
brain hypothesis

969
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,180
sometimes um

970
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,480
[Music]

971
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
could be used in a a very

972
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,640
um instrumentalist way

973
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
we're using bayesian statistics to do

974
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
neurobehavioral research

975
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
it might be

976
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,040
um a realist implementational

977
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
um claim like the brain is doing

978
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
bayesian statistics or something like

979
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,240
bayesian statistics so this hypothesis

980
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,440
floats kind of among the layers of mars

981
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
analysis

982
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
like implementational algorithmic

983
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,160
computational

984
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,450
um

985
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,599
[Music]

986
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,359
and people do use it to mean different

987
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,839
things

988
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,920
and in bayesian graphs in bayesian

989
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,640
statistics it can be about perception or

990
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
it could be about action so bayesian

991
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,800
brain hypothesis depending on how

992
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,640
somebody frames it

993
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,400
and what specific models they're talking

994
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,440
about

995
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,640
might include

996
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,480
for example all of these because these

997
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,440
might be

998
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,920
applied in a bayesian framework to talk

999
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
about the brain

1000
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
ben

1001
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,359
yeah i mean i think you've covered it

1002
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,440
really really well but i i wish i'd have

1003
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
had access or knowledge of the result

1004
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,720
the the

1005
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,119
talk that you just mentioned because

1006
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,480
trying to differentiate predictive

1007
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,000
processing from active inference has

1008
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,599
been a kind of source of pain and

1009
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,040
confusion for me over the last few

1010
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,560
months and

1011
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
i just i thought another way of putting

1012
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
it perhaps because i think i know the

1013
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
difference now is essentially

1014
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
um

1015
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,920
some

1016
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,000
presentations of predictive processing

1017
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
are active inference

1018
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,280
in the sense that they're highly

1019
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,599
embodied inactive

1020
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,040
embedded

1021
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,160
and so if you have a predictive

1022
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
processing that draws on these four

1023
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,400
reaccounts of cognition it tends to just

1024
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,320
that just is active inference active

1025
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,400
inference is kind of necessarily

1026
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,720
inactive and embodied and there's a

1027
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,320
paper um

1028
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,240
i should say there's a paper by i i

1029
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
believe it's called wilding the

1030
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,440
predictive brain

1031
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,920
it's by andy clark kate nave

1032
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
mark miller and

1033
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,960
george dean i think which basically

1034
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,520
takes predictive processing as a theory

1035
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,240
of

1036
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,119
neural processing and weaves in these

1037
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,400
kind of

1038
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,480
cognitive these four e narratives really

1039
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,320
really well and kind of fleshes out a

1040
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
much more

1041
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
active infancy picture it's kind of the

1042
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,200
paper brings predictive process and

1043
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,640
active inference together really nicely

1044
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,400
i think

1045
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,599
thanks great suggestion and

1046
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,280
just without going into too much detail

1047
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,920
if this is the causal graph architecture

1048
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,640
of a predictive processing system

1049
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,680
one can imagine that like mu

1050
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,640
is

1051
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,480
being a markov blanket with respect to

1052
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
these two epsilons or so on

1053
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,880
so predictive processing doesn't

1054
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,839
highlight as much the markov blanket

1055
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,800
formalism predictive processing is not a

1056
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,839
physics for particular systems

1057
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,760
like fep is

1058
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,640
but

1059
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,800
it's not incompatible

1060
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,520
so

1061
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,359
maybe they're just different fingers

1062
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,200
pointing at similar or different parts

1063
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,480
of the moon

1064
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,440
um so there isn't an incompatibility

1065
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
especially as over the recent years

1066
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,640
active inference implemented predictive

1067
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
architectures and approaches

1068
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
and predictive processing started to

1069
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,200
undergo that pragmatic inactive 4e5e

1070
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,560
whatever

1071
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,359
um infusion

1072
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,880
which led to them modeling action as a

1073
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
variable

1074
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
and so all they did was they just made

1075
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,640
it so instead of the free energy being

1076
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,480
only about sensory observations and

1077
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,880
expectations they just tucked action in

1078
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
and it doesn't radically restructure the

1079
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,280
architecture

1080
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,599
it just means that action is a variable

1081
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,200
in these equations

1082
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
so

1083
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,040
um

1084
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,079
43.1 uh zero one and two are all good

1085
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,440
places to look

1086
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,680
okay

1087
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,800
um

1088
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,640
this was a short question internals

1089
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
estate and external state were added to

1090
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
the ontology but sometimes um like if

1091
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,640
you have a quotation mark and then an at

1092
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,040
it won't bring it up

1093
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,960
so sometimes you have to type it with an

1094
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,920
at first

1095
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,280
okay

1096
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,880
in our um

1097
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,000
last

1098
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,040
15 minutes

1099
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,200
okay these two are um good maybe we

1100
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,800
could do a first pass on them and then

1101
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,119
in the coming week like add notes and

1102
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,400
more questions to discuss

1103
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,880
they wrote if one defines preferred

1104
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,280
states as expected states then one can

1105
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
say that living organisms must minimize

1106
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,960
the surprise of their sensory

1107
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,640
observations

1108
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,440
i'm not clear on the ontology here

1109
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
is it that preference is the same as

1110
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,200
expectation

1111
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
or that formally we can use them in the

1112
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,480
same equation or something else

1113
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,319
does active inference make ontological

1114
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,680
claims like

1115
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,920
preference is actually expectation just

1116
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
as heat is actually the excitation of

1117
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,599
molecules

1118
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,119
more generally is the free energy in

1119
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,880
physics just an analogy or is it an

1120
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,520
ontological assertion

1121
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,200
who would like to approach one of the

1122
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,919
aspects of this question

1123
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,200
i can i i would like to take a stop but

1124
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,560
again i guess guess yes please

1125
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,440
i guess

1126
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,079
it's not saying that they're the same

1127
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,520
but that

1128
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,920
we want like if we're minimizing free

1129
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,040
energy

1130
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,359
we're trying to make it the same

1131
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,240
and but if they're surprised they won't

1132
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,760
be the same

1133
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,319
i guess the goal is to get them as close

1134
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,880
as possible

1135
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,640
that's that will be my guess on this

1136
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,680
thank you

1137
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,280
good insight um also point to two ways

1138
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,520
that expectation is conversationally

1139
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,560
used

1140
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,200
um the expectation with the fancy e

1141
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
is the expected mean of a distribution

1142
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,319
like expected returns might be about the

1143
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,079
future but it's actually referring to

1144
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,520
the mean estimate of a distribution in

1145
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
the gaussian case the mean and the mode

1146
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,040
are the same

1147
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,640
mode seeking and mean seeking are

1148
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,680
equivalent

1149
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
there can also be a variance estimator

1150
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,079
and so on so the expectation of a

1151
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,640
gaussian is like tremendously

1152
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,240
informative

1153
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,319
expectation can also mean

1154
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,920
things that are

1155
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,520
predicted about the future

1156
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,400
that's a conversational what do you

1157
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,119
expect it to be tomorrow

1158
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,680
both can be conjoined like

1159
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,280
what do you expect the temperature to be

1160
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,880
tomorrow

1161
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,599
is the expectation of a distribution of

1162
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,960
the uncertainty of the temperature

1163
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,079
distribution at the time point tomorrow

1164
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,800
so they're not exclusive definitions

1165
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,720
it just has to be understood

1166
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,319
what this means

1167
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,760
because it'd be like well if our

1168
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,640
predictions about the future

1169
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,240
are our preferences you know then

1170
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,319
there's all kinds of tangles that you

1171
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,680
know one might find themselves in

1172
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,560
also

1173
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,640
um

1174
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,279
the um

1175
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,520
i'm uh not remembering which number it

1176
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,880
was

1177
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,560
but um

1178
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,880
[Music]

1179
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
the dual usage

1180
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,960
of the same term

1181
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,200
to reflect the organism's preferred

1182
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,960
states

1183
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,119
and also

1184
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,330
the centering of the distribution

1185
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,480
[Music]

1186
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,560
at that time point and other time points

1187
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,720
and then just like jessica mentioned

1188
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,760
this

1189
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
operation of free energy minimization

1190
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,680
is in service of reducing the divergence

1191
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
between the preferred state

1192
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,599
and the um

1193
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,720
the expectation of the preferred state

1194
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,960
which is can be set or learned

1195
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,560
and then the um

1196
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
the observations that are coming in

1197
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,359
so

1198
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,240
um

1199
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,359
in one equation it leans more towards

1200
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,040
the english description of a preference

1201
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,200
like the organism prefers to be at 72

1202
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,359
and in the other sense that is like the

1203
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,160
expectation of a distribution

1204
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,760
and there's some observation

1205
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,359
distribution

1206
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,400
with a minimization of a divergence

1207
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,599
such that

1208
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,720
if

1209
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,960
the observations

1210
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,200
were realizing preferences

1211
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,800
then those distributions would be

1212
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,960
aligned

1213
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,839
um

1214
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,920
so yes

1215
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,079
these terms are not

1216
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,079
these terms are more like phenomena or

1217
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,119
natural language tags

1218
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,119
also it'll be awesome in

1219
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,319
the last

1220
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,440
two weeks of june

1221
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,680
in 46 active inference models do not

1222
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,599
contradict folk psychology

1223
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,280
this will be extended extended

1224
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,400
discussions on like wanting beliefs

1225
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
intentions

1226
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,480
which variables inactive

1227
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,079
are appropriate

1228
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,079
for being described that way

1229
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,000
does it contradict one or the other

1230
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,440
those are like things that we'll explore

1231
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,720
so

1232
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,280
the equations are just what they are

1233
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,560
and then

1234
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,960
in some usages

1235
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,200
a variable is like

1236
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,960
the organism's preferred states what

1237
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
it's trying to reduce its divergence

1238
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,160
between

1239
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,720
and also that is like where it expects

1240
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,440
to be and that's what licenses the use

1241
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,680
of surprise

1242
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,480
and minimizing surprise

1243
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,599
because

1244
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,359
an observation right at the center of

1245
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,079
the gaussian is minimally surprising we

1246
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,000
talked about that in chapter two an

1247
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,200
observation that's outside of the

1248
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,240
gaussian is highly surprising

1249
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,280
so

1250
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,400
if we have some sort of distribution

1251
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,359
of

1252
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,480
outcomes

1253
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,319
we could ask how closely are they

1254
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,960
aligned with our preferences

1255
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,760
in terms of surprise

1256
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,160
due to this dual use of the same

1257
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,640
variables

1258
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,800
does active inference make ontological

1259
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,160
claims do theories make claims

1260
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,000
do people make claims

1261
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
eg preference is actually expectation

1262
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,680
just as heat is actually excitation of

1263
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
molecules

1264
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
anyone can raise their hand at any time

1265
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,359
we'll

1266
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,760
talk about that in the folk psychology

1267
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,839
but it's an interesting question ben

1268
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,720
yeah

1269
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,280
i wonder if um it seems to me like these

1270
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,960
questions are taking us maybe into the

1271
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,480
map territory um debate that we i think

1272
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,319
we spoke about last time

1273
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,200
about the you know how um

1274
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,680
realist or concrete should we think

1275
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,200
about

1276
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,559
um

1277
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,960
the kind of ontological claims of active

1278
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,800
inference there's certainly certainly

1279
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
the last part of that question i think

1280
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,319
about whether we should take it as an

1281
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,359
analogy

1282
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,880
um

1283
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,000
so yeah i think it's quite a big

1284
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,200
question but i don't i don't know

1285
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,760
um

1286
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,640
okay i won't find the slide here but um

1287
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,200
is the free energy in physics an analogy

1288
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,559
not sure if this is saying like the

1289
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,559
gibbs free energy or if that's actually

1290
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,240
talking about like the variational free

1291
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,640
energy or the expected free energy which

1292
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,720
are statistical so

1293
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,040
i don't know if it's an analogy

1294
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,359
or an ontological assertion

1295
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,280
other than

1296
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,400
um

1297
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,079
just to connect it to like a linear

1298
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,960
model with a gaussian error distribution

1299
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,720
is that an ontological assertion that

1300
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,800
there is a gaussian error distribution

1301
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,480
in the world

1302
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,760
no

1303
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,119
so

1304
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,200
are statistical quantities ontological

1305
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,240
assertions about the world

1306
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,400
maybe there's some nuance but broadly

1307
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,960
speaking no

1308
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,760
um

1309
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,160
and also just like on the math learning

1310
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,520
group we've

1311
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,599
expanded our operation

1312
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,119
due to many

1313
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,800
active participants

1314
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,040
so just note that the

1315
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,000
meetings are at 19 utc on monday tuesday

1316
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,680
wednesday and thursday

1317
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,760
and they're in the discord voice chat

1318
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,680
not in this gather

1319
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,720
but

1320
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,760
um

1321
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
we've been working on the resources

1322
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,040
on the notation

1323
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,119
basic and background questions as well

1324
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,040
as overviews of the math for different

1325
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,079
chapters like basically just summarizing

1326
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,200
and then

1327
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,800
um

1328
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
several um people and this is an example

1329
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,240
of like the broken link it's like

1330
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,319
variational free energy is deleted so

1331
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,000
just one time somebody has to come

1332
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,800
through

1333
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,200
and just add it back in

1334
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,400
but these are natural language

1335
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,000
descriptions

1336
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,839
that will be very easy to

1337
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,559
um transmute into computer code and

1338
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,359
translate amongst human languages and

1339
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,800
provides a lot of legibility and

1340
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,440
comprehensibility so

1341
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,640
a lot of the math group has been

1342
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,359
modifying like the equations

1343
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,280
and everybody is welcome to join those

1344
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,440
like discord sessions

1345
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,839
and contribute with questions or with

1346
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,599
knowledge and expertise like no matter

1347
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,200
where somebody is in learning or

1348
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,960
discussing these equations

1349
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,359
they are the essence of active inference

1350
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,599
so questions random notes related

1351
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,640
thoughts expertise are all essential for

1352
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,599
us improving our shared understanding

1353
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,760
and then just in the last five minutes

1354
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,559
um page 42 they wrote

1355
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,800
in advanced organisms preferred states

1356
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,119
can also extend to learned cognitive

1357
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,280
goals and go on to say that advanced

1358
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,040
organisms like human

1359
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,559
can achieve

1360
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,480
preferred states

1361
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,559
by increasingly abstract social cultural

1362
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,079
strategies like they talked about

1363
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,680
thermoregulation

1364
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,200
and then all the way up to like air

1365
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,000
conditioning distribution systems

1366
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
my question is

1367
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,319
if they are cast in terms of active

1368
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,400
inference

1369
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,240
must all of these preferred states and

1370
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,760
strategies be ultimately linked to

1371
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,480
survival in some way

1372
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,319
or in the case of advanced organisms can

1373
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,920
free energy be related to something

1374
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,880
other than survival

1375
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,599
mike and then anyone else

1376
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,240
yeah it feels like this notion of

1377
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,079
survival and preferred states gets

1378
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,240
conflated in a

1379
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
sort of odd way

1380
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,160
not everything is about survival right

1381
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,680
and so

1382
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,040
you might have

1383
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,319
some measurement of surprise if you're

1384
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,559
in a temperature that's 120 degrees but

1385
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,040
it's survivable for a period of time

1386
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,720
whereas if you're in a temperature of

1387
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,760
300 degrees fahrenheit

1388
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,839
not survivable right

1389
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,119
um

1390
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,559
but if you contrast that with other

1391
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,640
things that could be equally surprising

1392
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,480
or outside the distribution as you

1393
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,280
described it earlier

1394
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,760
the notion of that all swans are white

1395
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,319
but then you find a black spawn and so

1396
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,400
uh you'd never conceived that there

1397
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,480
might be a black swan before that lives

1398
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,599
outside

1399
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,920
your distribution and creates a surprise

1400
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,559
but it's not necessarily survival rated

1401
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,559
thank you so there's a there's a sort of

1402
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,559
a missing severity in there somewhere

1403
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,558
okay thank you ali and then lyle

1404
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,319
well i think work life here is used

1405
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,520
somehow in a more black way

1406
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,800
meaning system that resists dispersion

1407
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
and energy dissipation

1408
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,520
so it's not necessarily biological

1409
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,520
survival

1410
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,880
yes great point systems that fail to

1411
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,359
persist survive will not

1412
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,000
continue to be that thing

1413
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,240
and that's just in like a physical sense

1414
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,920
repeated measurements are only enabled

1415
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,079
by systems that are persistent at that

1416
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,400
time scale not eternally

1417
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,720
and so when we want to have a theory or

1418
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,920
a framework or a physics for things

1419
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,280
then

1420
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,119
they have to look as if they are

1421
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,440
minimizing free energy otherwise they

1422
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,079
will simply not be that thing

1423
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,280
ben and then lyle

1424
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,960
yeah so this was my question i suppose

1425
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,720
just to just to kind of clarify it

1426
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,480
quickly um

1427
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,720
it just one of the things i wonder most

1428
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,319
about active influences it seems to me

1429
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,040
at least in my life i'm quite often

1430
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,359
making decisions and having preferences

1431
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,079
that seem so abstracted from

1432
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,520
you know my attunement with my

1433
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,160
environment or my continued viability as

1434
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
a system you know like my preference

1435
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,559
which mug i'm gonna drink coffee out of

1436
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,920
in the morning

1437
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,960
it seems

1438
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,040
in some sense removed

1439
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,920
from

1440
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,079
my free energy the way that free energy

1441
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,040
is described in the literature um

1442
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,160
so that's kind of what i meant

1443
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,240
great in um

1444
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,280
uh yesterday's 45.2

1445
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,160
we asked specifically like how can all

1446
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,440
behavior be optimal when like mistakes

1447
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,280
are made or oddly ask the question like

1448
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,880
what about when there's like sacrificial

1449
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,119
or alt altruistic behavior

1450
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,280
and there's

1451
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,319
a great answer in 45.2

1452
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,240
but suffice to say that with different

1453
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,960
priors all behavior can be cast as

1454
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,760
optimal behavior so the normativity

1455
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,160
isn't referring to what should be done

1456
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,559
or what is best but it's rather like a

1457
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,079
process normativity lyle

1458
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,520
right so yeah

1459
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520
this for me tees up the question i

1460
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,440
continue to have about the approach

1461
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,079
which is how does how does the

1462
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,319
concept of novelty

1463
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,280
which

1464
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,440
some

1465
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,520
organisms would

1466
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,799
pursue

1467
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,240
fit into

1468
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,880
this concept of i mean how would it even

1469
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,760
be represented here and and novelty is

1470
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,920
not just a human trait but you would see

1471
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,040
it across all kinds of creatures

1472
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,599
that would seek out would seek out novel

1473
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,319
and surprising experience you know not

1474
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:13,520
expected

1475
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,920
so i for me it's it's kind of an open

1476
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,599
question about how that's captured in

1477
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,880
this framework

1478
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,920
yes the beginning and ending of 45.2

1479
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,760
carl's um focus was on curiosity

1480
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,200
and

1481
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,440
there's various ways to approach it and

1482
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,770
um

1483
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,680
[Music]

1484
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,599
it's an actual question about novelty of

1485
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,599
different types and scales

1486
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,319
and

1487
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,280
within the hierarchical modeling one can

1488
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,000
understand novelty of different kinds

1489
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and this again is just like the kernel

1490
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,520
this is like the single linear

1491
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,640
regression

1492
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,559
and then there's like model selection

1493
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,480
across hierarchically nested linear

1494
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,240
models

1495
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,880
much development beyond the kernel but

1496
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,960
this is like a kernel but um and

1497
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,640
especially when thinking about expected

1498
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,920
free energy

1499
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,240
a path can move to a novel area

1500
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,079
because it's part of an expected

1501
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,319
trajectory that does reduce risk and

1502
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,680
ambiguity and so on so

1503
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,119
that's the deflationary approach to

1504
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,799
novelty pursuit

1505
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,960
jessica and then we'll end the

1506
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,440
discussion

1507
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:24,640
at the end

1508
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,599
danny you mention it and i guess i i see

1509
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,119
novelty

1510
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,319
i sort of like the epistemic origin

1511
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,920
and so it's like you are

1512
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,599
seeking on like new information new

1513
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,880
things

1514
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,119
in order to minimize uh that uncertainty

1515
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,480
i not so much that novelty is on cellar

1516
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,920
than t because like like if we look at

1517
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,799
um

1518
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,359
no i've been thinking like oh it's new

1519
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,480
and therefore it's going to be

1520
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,920
surprising

1521
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,640
and and so we want to minimize those

1522
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,480
things and then yes or also if we look

1523
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,359
at uncertainty equal to risk we can say

1524
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,839
like novelty

1525
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,240
is because of the unknown represented

1526
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,640
risk and if we're minimizing uncertainty

1527
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,799
we're trying to minimize rest

1528
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,720
but from what i saw a little bit on

1529
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,319
chapter two

1530
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,160
and it's sort of like we're not

1531
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,359
necessarily trying to minimize race or

1532
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,480
on

1533
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,160
like the unknown

1534
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,960
and like depending on our preferences we

1535
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,280
might tolerate high res

1536
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,839
and what we're trying to minimize is the

1537
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,799
surprise of what we expect like if i'm

1538
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,319
in finance

1539
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:45,200
and i expect very high risk in an

1540
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,680
investment but i already know that

1541
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,680
and

1542
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,119
you know and high risk comes back on

1543
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,240
like my um uncertainty was minimized

1544
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
even though there was a lot of risk or

1545
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,480
there were a lot of like unknowns on or

1546
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,640
like novelty and things like that but it

1547
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,799
was already in my expectation of what

1548
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,319
was going to happen

1549
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,280
so

1550
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,440
i was already minimizing that even in

1551
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,960
reality it may look like um

1552
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,760
that there was a lot of uncertainty uh

1553
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,200
in actuality

1554
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,520
um but in my model

1555
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,000
there isn't and so that's kind of like

1556
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,240
how i explained that and to me a little

1557
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,040
bit and in terms of novelty for like

1558
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,760
adventure and like

1559
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,160
on curiosity and things like that i i

1560
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,520
equated more to epistemic foraging as a

1561
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,839
way of learning and updating the model

1562
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,559
and that's why we're doing it

1563
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,119
thanks jessica i'll just add one closing

1564
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,240
note on that

1565
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,319
i would argue that it's the

1566
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,240
pragmatic

1567
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,720
absolutism the reinforcement and reward

1568
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,599
learning centrism that has curtailed an

1569
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,480
effective theory of novelty or curiosity

1570
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,839
because

1571
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,440
radically different kinds of actions

1572
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,119
have to be coerced into a value

1573
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,359
framework whether it's deep q-learning

1574
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,520
or reinforcement or anything like that

1575
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
there has to be like a novelty bonus or

1576
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,920
all these other ad-hoc unprincipled

1577
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,920
approaches they might be super technical

1578
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,520
they might be super effective but

1579
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,040
they're not driven from first principles

1580
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,280
in variational free energy f and

1581
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,440
expected free energy g

1582
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,839
there's this like minimum of two

1583
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,040
with pragmatic value which is to um

1584
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,040
bring alignment between the preferences

1585
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,559
and the observations

1586
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,720
and the epistemic value associated with

1587
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,200
what is casually called novelty or

1588
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,920
curiosity at that scale of potentially a

1589
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,720
hierarchical model so active inference

1590
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,760
does provide partitioning and an

1591
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,040
imperative

1592
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,280
that helps us address the phenomena of

1593
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,480
curiosity and of novelty in a way that

1594
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,359
is quite disparate from trying to coerce

1595
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,880
it into a value of curiosity is

1596
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,079
expected pragmatic value or the value of

1597
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,720
basic research is the expected utility

1598
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,000
that it could bring

1599
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,559
so but these are all really awesome and

1600
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,520
open and ongoing questions so

1601
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,160
we will um close the recording and then

1602
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,319
have just a one minute break then in

1603
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,599
this room we'll continue with dot tools

1604
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,839
organizational unit and if anybody wants

1605
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,119
to like talk about something else they

1606
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,839
can go to a different um gather room so

1607
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,680
thanks everybody and see you next week

1608
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,078
thanks
