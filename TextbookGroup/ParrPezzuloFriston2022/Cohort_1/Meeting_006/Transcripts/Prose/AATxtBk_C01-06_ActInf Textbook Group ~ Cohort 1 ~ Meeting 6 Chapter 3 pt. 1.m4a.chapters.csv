1770	53822	00:01	It is June 9, 2022, and it's chapter three, week one of the textbook group. There weren't any ideas added for three, but if people have any key themes or any ideas that they picked up on with three, they can add them here. Next week we'll continue the discussion on three.	We're going to go to the questions on chapter three of the textbook	Chapter 3, Week 1
53956	335430	00:53	What is the high road to active inference? How did the approach of chapter three feel different than the approach or the topics of chapter two? And also you can take notes on this idea of the book, like high road generally.	What is the high road to active inference in this book	The High Road to Active Inference
340340	870462	05:40	No additional information about the future is gained by finding out about the past. The Markov blanket is the set of variables that mediate all statistical interactions between a system and its environment. Lyle, how can this be true?	On page 43 and box 3.1, they write no additional information about future gained	Markov Blankets and the Future
870596	1315250	14:30	A statistical interaction is the edge in a causal Bayes graph. What would a non statistical interaction be? There's various ways to approach that. Does it make sense to think of a Markov blanket in the context of an internal agent state and an external environment?	What is a statistical rather than a non statistical interaction? Ali and then anyone else	What is a statistical rather than a non-statistical interaction?
1317770	1548590	21:57	In this figure, active states are expressed in terms of external states and markup blankets. But it should be vice versa. The flows of internal and active states should not depend on external states. I still don't completely understand what that picture should look like.	In this figure, active states are expressed in terms of external states	Bayes graph, Interactions between internal and active states
1548660	1792160	25:48	The physics of the free energy principle explores different entity niche causal relationships. Some violate the Markov blanket condition. It may be possible to design or describe or imagine systems that have different causal architectures.	Guest Room 7.1 explores different entity niche causal relationships	Different causal architectures of the free energy principle
1793090	1911510	29:53	In four days we will have Dalton and Maxwell et al. for a guest stream. If people have suggestions for guest streams, that can be accomplished. Being there live, but especially getting involved eagerly and actively and early is the biggest leverage point.	Ramset at All recently published a fascinating paper on Bayesian mechanics	Bayesian mechanics: partitioning and markup blankets
1912330	2028410	31:52	Why does independence between the flows on the two sides of the blanket matter so much? And also I think it relates to what we read in chapter two about hidden states. But we'll hopefully develop more answers and notes here.

2029900	2147870	33:49	What is the differences between and among the terms Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive processing, predictive coding and active inference? Might you be able to suggest references or resources for where these distinctions are delineated?	Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive processing, predictive coding and active inference	What is the Differences between and among the terms Bayesian Brain Hyp
2150240	2486850	35:50	Predictive coding and the free energy principle are often equated with one another. Trying to differentiate predictive processing from active inference has been a source of pain and confusion for me over the last few months. Does anyone have any other thoughts or questions on this?	Ben Martin: Trying to differentiate predictive processing from active inference is difficult	Bayesian Brain Hypothesis
2488420	3143040	41:28	Expectation can also mean things that are predicted about the future. Does active inference make ontological claims like preference is actually expectation, just as heat is actually the excitation of molecules? Is the free energy and physics just an analogy or is it an ontological assertion?	Is preference the same as expectation or something else	Expectation and Active Inference
3144580	3279420	52:24	Systems that fail to persist, survive, will not continue to be that thing. And so when we want to have a theory or a framework or a physics for things, then they have to look as if they are minimizing free energy. With different priors, all behavior can be cast as optimal behavior.	System that resists dispersion and energy dissipation is called persistent	Optimal Behavior in 45.2
3279570	3384640	54:39	How does the concept of novelty fit into this concept of I mean, how would it even be represented here? And novelty is not just a human trait, but you would see it across all kinds of creatures that would seek out novel and surprising experience, not expected.	Jessica: How does the concept of novelty fit into this framework	On novelty and the hierarchical modeling of science
3385010	3629880	56:25	Nova: I see novelty as sort of like the epistemic origin. Not so much that novelty is uncertainty. What we're trying to minimize is the surprise of what we expect. It's the pragmatic absolutism that has curtailed an effective theory of novelty or curiosity.	Nova says novelty is because of the unknown represented risk	Non-Probability of Knowledge and Knowledge
