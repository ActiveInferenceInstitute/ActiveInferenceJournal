1770	29080	1	A	0.99987	00:01	64	Hello, everyone. It is June 9, 2022, and it's chapter three, week one, and it's the first cohort of the textbook group. We're going to go to the questions. There weren't any ideas added for three, but if people have any key themes or any ideas that they picked up on with three, they can add them here. Otherwise we'll go to the questions.
30090	67250	2	A	0.98	00:30	87	And also if people have questions in the chat, or it would be also great just to take notes or add questions and continue to upload them. And then next week we'll continue the discussion on three. So this is just the opening set of questions, maybe just the first ideas of the book. Turning to questions, now that we've at least gone through chapter two once and part of chapter three, or the whole thing of chapter three, what is the high road to active inference?
78740	90950	3	A	0.99999	01:18	27	What does anyone think about the high road to active inference or about this low road high road construct that is used in chapters two and three?
94220	100990	4	A	1.0	01:34	20	Just broadly, how did the approach of chapter three feel different than the approach or the topics of chapter two?
112160	124572	5	A	0.69044	01:52	29	JF and then Ali. I just want. To make the Joe comment that the. High road approach is what first grabbed. Me when I encountered the free energy principle.
124716	136820	6	B	0.71	02:04	18	That what really fascinated me, that there. Was an attempt at a unifying answer. To self organization, cognition.
140380	151130	7	A	0.57	02:20	24	That this could. All be brought together around some relatively. Sparse number of concepts. That's what grabbed me much more than the lower road.
153280	156300	8	A	0.99928	02:33	6	Thank you, Ali and then Ben?
159040	219132	9	C	0.97487	02:39	114	Well, yeah, reading chapter three actually clarified my previously held, in fact wrong belief that previously I thought that a low road was a kind of bottom off approach and the high road is top down approach. But now I see that low road was basically tackling the problem of active inference from the inferential point of view and from the statistical and inferential point of view. But in the high road we have a much more generalized and much more, let's say, all encompassing view to tackle the problem of active inference, namely by way of defining markup blankets and all the properties of living organisms and so on. Awesome. Thank you, Ben.
219196	242756	10	A	1.0	03:39	74	And then anyone else who raises their hand. And also you can take notes on this idea of the book, like high road generally. Ben and then Mike. Yeah, I think for me as well, this chapter three and the high road has been an easier road in. And the thing that I noticed about it was, it seems to me, so they say in the introduction, that active inference is a normative theory.
242868	269200	11	D	1.0	04:02	85	I feel like the high road, to me, feels there's much more normativity in the high road. It's an account of what organisms have to do. And I think compared to the previous chapter, I think chapter two felt a lot more descriptive for me. I'm not sure other people would. Maybe that's just the way that I was reading it, but it felt like chapter three was a lot more kind of it had a more normative force to it that I really enjoyed.
270420	271840	12	A	0.99994	04:30	3	Thank you, Mike.
281430	307500	13	E	0.60753	04:41	67	There we go. Sorry, my computer was not responding. So I went through a similar experience as Ollie described in terms of going into it, thinking about bottoms up and top down and coming out of it, thinking about it differently. I feel like in chapter three there's still a lot to unpack around the Markov blanket. So that is still capturing this inferential nature of things.
308190	324930	14	E	0.61	05:08	44	It still has a Bayesian quality like what we saw in chapter two. But it also, for me at least, it still feels a bit opaque at this point in terms of this sort of indirect influence that's taking place across the Markov blanket.
326950	335430	15	A	0.99997	05:26	20	Awesome. Okay, any other comments? Otherwise we're going to go to the questions and we'll approach many of those topics.
340340	386570	16	A	1.0	05:40	75	Okay, first question regarding the Markov blanket explanation. On page 43 and box 3.1, they write, no additional information about the future is gained by finding out about the past. Assuming we know the present, how can this be true? That's one question they define regarding the Markov blanket as the set of variables that mediate all statistical interactions between a system and its environment. What is a statistical rather than a non statistical interaction?
390110	413010	17	A	0.99983	06:30	57	They write that they've supplemented conditional independencies with dynamical constraints so that the flows do not depend upon states on the opposite side of the blanket. Why does independence between the flows on the two sides of the blanket matter so much? All right, great. So who would like to give a thought on this? First question?
413160	421000	18	A	0.99991	06:53	23	How can it be true about Marco blankets that no additional information about the future is gained by finding out about the past?
432790	454966	19	E	0.89167	07:12	54	So I added a note in there. You can tell me if this is correct or not with regard to Markov chains that as I understand the Markov chain in its present state is effectively capturing all the information about the past. So I assume that translates into the Markov blanket. Yes. Great comment.
454998	505930	20	A	0.58	07:34	118	And a Markov chain is used very broadly. And just to give one example, it's like the current state of the chessboard, knowing more about previous moves doesn't tell you more about the future. And so it's like it's a one Markov chain because the dependency is only about that one time step. Now if it were to violate that condition of being a one Markov blanket through time and have like a three Markov blanket, that would mean that the same board position, depending on what move happened three before, was still having some influence on how the system evolved. That wouldn't violate the Markovian property, it would just make it a different kind of Markov chain.
506430	540390	21	A	0.94	08:26	69	And that is commonly used in the temporal modeling, like in time series modeling and in transitions of stochastic processes. The Markov blanket is abstracting. It from this time sequence idea. Like the now is a blanket between the past and the future. And we could think about spatial systems like a Newton's cradle or something like that, as well as spatial temporal systems or just abstract causal systems.
540890	569438	22	A	0.5558	09:00	67	So how can this be true? It's true by definition because that's what the definition of a Markov blanket is. Whether that description is adequate or maps on to carving, nature of the joints and all these other things are respectively statistical model comparison and ontological philosophical questions. But it's true by definition about Markov blankets. Lyle yeah, I think actually you just pretty much covered it.
569444	610318	23	B	0.66462	09:29	92	But I would just say this is the same condition if you're building RL models of different kinds of autonomous systems, this is the same restriction. I think your comment about the nested blankets is interesting because in the RL space we typically don't have that kind of richness. But what we do then would be, for example, we want to know the distance. And in that case we would just create, basically create a state variable, which is the history of the state transition. So we fudge it a little bit.
610404	648362	24	B	0.99998	10:10	90	But your explanation that in this conception with nested Markov blankets, then that would be the more comprehensive solution to that issue. Thanks. Just to kind of clarify, there like one hack or workaround would be like you make the list of all of the last possible three moves and then you make a one Markov blanket with all the last combinations of three. That's right. So it still uses the machinery of a one Markov chain, which has the simplest transition matrix, but it could encompass the last states.
648416	672646	25	A	0.99969	10:48	55	But it sort of compresses them into a one Markov chain format. Yeah, I mean, very often you want to know the average of the last 20 time steps. You're just trying to smooth something, right. And it's just way too much work to build all that machinery in there. So you make that average.
672698	701926	26	B	0.73989	11:12	74	Actually a present variable is what you do. Great example. If something really does depend on the last 20 time steps, or you want to do model comparison as to whether it's a better model that is conditioned on the last 15 or 20 or 30, you can just condense it with summary statistics and descriptions. Again into this one Markov framework. Otherwise the combinatorics of how the 20 influence each other is vast.
702118	733540	27	F	0.60402	11:42	56	Brock I guess that's related to what my comment was just going to be. That the way they worded it. If you're not rigidly thinking about a singular Markov blanket, just practically speaking, finding about the past usually does give you information about the future. If you're talking about outside of a singular Markov blanket. Right.
736150	763438	28	F	0.99902	12:16	60	Adding the words no additional information about the future of the Markov blanket is gained by finding out about the past. The Markov blanket kind of balance that. But in the case of the machine learning example and comparing models, you're necessarily talking about a much larger markup blanket than just a singular one there, right? Yes, same thing. Yes.
763524	789446	29	A	0.71	12:43	84	And just like many concepts have like a broader conversational, informal sense in a narrow, more technical sense, assuming we know the present means fully knowing the present, fully knowing the blanket. So it's like but I could still learn things about the past. So that's not to say that there isn't novel information that you could discover about the past. Like you could still go back in that chess game and learn information. So it's not that there isn't information in the past.
789628	808170	30	A	0.99964	13:09	48	It's not that it wouldn't even be interesting. It's that for the purposes of how the present goes into the next time step the present blanket in this temporal Markov chain, which is like a blanket through time, it contains the information you need for the transition frequencies.
810290	855030	31	A	0.95	13:30	89	Okay. They define that it's the set of variables that mediate. And also the Markov blanket using last names, personal opinion is not helpful because not only are there multiple Markovs, but the Markovian property is not something that's technical or defined. So maybe someday we'll have better ways to describe and be more specific that don't involve invoking ambiguity around names. That being said, it was worked out analytically by Markov and sun and others, but most recently it was Pearl 1988 and causal inference with Bayesian perspective.
855110	874610	32	A	0.80274	14:15	51	So this is not like an active inference, ism it's? Drawing upon a total Bayesian statistical framework, any Bayes graph that's not fully connected is going to have some nodes that intermediate. So that's going to relate to this question. So what is a statistical rather than a non statistical interaction?
877190	880500	33	A	0.5514	14:37	11	Ali and then anyone else who would like to address that?
882710	937030	34	C	0.9899	14:42	87	Well, I think it has something to do with the way these interactions are parameterized and modeled. Because, you see, every phenomena can be parameterized and modeled from many various perspectives and frameworks within various frameworks. And the reason I think they put the term statistical in parentheses is that they mean that these variables mediate all interactions that have been parameterized statistically. So I think it refers to the nature of parameterizing and modeling these interactions as opposed to distinguishing between statistical and non statistical interactions.
942610	977750	35	A	0.69	15:42	77	All right, so anyone else can raise their hand, but just here's a few thoughts on that. A statistical interaction is the edge in a causal Bayes graph. And people might be more familiar or have seen like structural equation modeling, where nodes are variables and edges are the correlation between or among variables. Conditioning on the structure of the graph. In the causal Bayes graph, the nodes are variables and the edges are statistical causal influences.
977910	1007380	36	A	0.99985	16:17	73	So causality and statistics is not always the same as what people mean by cause in the real world. But like granger causality and just this notion of like coarse graining and cause. It may line up with the sort of narrative natural language description that somebody has between when they're speaking. It might be narrower than that, it might be a different thing than that. It might be more general than that.
1009830	1012980	37	A	1.0	16:49	7	What would a non statistical interaction be?
1015290	1034938	38	A	0.77524	16:55	48	There's various ways to approach that. It's kind of pointing towards some sort of like a touch could be an interaction. But what if things are touching but those variables don't change as a function of their touching? Then do those things interact or not? That's one question.
1035104	1057026	39	A	1.0	17:15	49	And then cause there's like just tremendous real world and philosophy questions like what causes what, what's the difference making cause? What's the cause that makes a difference? Necessity and sufficiency. There's so many questions in this like causal philosophy and this is highlighting. We're talking about the model.
1057208	1096686	40	A	0.99999	17:37	107	We made a Bayes graph with height, weight and shirt color and here are the statistical effectors. And so we're not saying that there's no interaction between this and that in the real world. Now we're within the model and we're talking about the causal graph. And again, unless the Bayes graph is fully connected, there's going to be some partitioning scheme that will result in some set of nodes being conditionally independent from another set of nodes when conditioned upon a blanket. So it's not like features of the real world or even variables in a statistical equation can just be unilaterally tagged as blanket states.
1096868	1130010	41	A	0.96264	18:16	74	It's always a partition that coinstantiates two sides, internal and external. But there's a symmetry and the blanket. So it's not like features of the world or even features of the model are intrinsically, internal, external or blanket states. But that's a partitioning scheme that can be applied to Bayes graphs of like a vast various structures of Bayes graphs. And Bayes graphs can be applied to a vast number of real world situations.
1131070	1159220	42	A	0.57	18:51	62	And many, many papers and live streams discuss sort of like all encompassing Markovian monism Markov blankets all the way down nested Markov blankets. Are the world ranging to the critical perspectives, not necessarily detractors, but just those who believe that the usage of the concept is out of alignment with ways that people have used it. Mike and then anyone else.
1161910	1183370	43	E	0.99989	19:21	50	Does it make sense to think of a Markov blanket in the context of an internal agent state and an external environment? Is the Markov blanket serving as this kind of a decoupling component because of the way that things are conditionally independent based on the variables inside the blanket?
1191090	1192400	44	A	0.99947	19:51	4	What do people think?
1196210	1196960	45	A	1.0	19:56	1	Yes.
1200130	1257986	46	F	0.96	20:00	121	I mean, for the internal state to be different than the external state or have some other equilibrium other non equilibrium state that the external environment is in, you would have to necessarily have I'm not sure if decoupling is the right word, but some sort of conditional, dependent and independent sort of zone that separates those two regions. So here's figure 31. Thank you, Brock. The active in the sensory states compose the blanket now in various live streams and papers, the history of the concept again from the analytical pre computational phrasing of insulation of fluctuation of random variables to Pearl's Bayesian and computational framing. However, Pearl's Markov blanket concept doesn't have a delineation of active and sensory states.
1258168	1300266	47	A	0.82247	20:58	96	It's only like there's one kind of fabric in that blanket. It's just blanket states. Friston maybe this also will be shown to be traced to other places and ways. But one of the core things that Friston at all have brought into the picture was interpreting within the blanket states the states that have incoming dependencies to the system of interest as sensory and then the states that have outgoing dependencies from the system of interest as active states. So people may already see challenges and complexities that arise with the arrows and the directions.
1300458	1306820	48	A	1.0	21:40	20	And a lot of that is addressed in the how particular is the free energy principle of Aguilera et al.
1309190	1315250	49	A	0.99764	21:49	13	We're going to continue talking about this entity partitioning Ali and then Lyle.
1317770	1374454	50	C	0.99954	21:57	108	Well, I think we should point to a very important typographical error in this picture here because in this figure, active states are expressed in terms of external states and markup blankets and sensory states are expressed in terms of internal states and markup blankets. But it should be vice versa. I mean, the flows of internal and active states are independent of external states and the flows of external and sensory states do not depend on internal states. So we should change x and mu in those two equations. Yes, sometimes with a possible typo like that, it's so Egregious blatant that it's challenging to even know.
1374492	1402894	51	A	0.99999	22:54	85	But we can absolutely ask the authors. But just to read the equation and think about why it is that way. The dot is the rate of change of a variable. So the internal states are mu and so this is the rate of change of internal states, rate of change of external states x and the rate of change of u, the active states and y the sensory states. So we're looking at how these partitioned states in a Bayes graph change through time.
1403092	1434346	52	A	0.87	23:23	78	The states that are the blanket and the internal are the particular states. Those are referring to the particle that's like figure versus ground, the particle that's moving around the curious particle. The active entity is the particular states that is partitioning the thing, literally the thing away from the niche. Then there's the blanket states that are intermediating that interface. And then we'll also talk about autonomous states which are just the internal and the active states.
1434528	1499582	53	A	0.53966	23:54	134	So the equation is saying the rate of change in, for example, active states is a flow function F and a noise function. Both the flow and the noise function the subscript is referring to like that one. It's kind of like IPSO in Latin like, it's the flow on Mu and the noise on Mu, the flow, which is what the principle of least action converges us towards in the limit, when the statistical fluctuations from the Omega are low, is a function of certain variables. And so this is saying the flow of active states is a function of external sensory and active states. However, as Ali has pointed to, the arguments that should be guiding the flow of active states are actually the blanket states and internal states, not external states.
1499636	1531814	54	A	0.65	24:59	65	And then analogously sensory states should have a flow that's defined in terms of blanket states and external states, not internal states. Lyle and then Ali yeah. So actually I think you're getting right right at the question I had because I was confused about the bi directional arrows, particularly between internal states and active states. Right? And I think you're drilling right into that.
1531852	1551134	55	B	1.0	25:31	48	I still don't completely understand what that picture should look like. But I have trouble conceptually I sort of get a conceptually, I feel like I get the Markov blanket, but that representation. I have trouble working through the details on that. Cool. So, guest stream number seven.
1551332	1585210	56	A	0.99999	25:51	71	How particular is the physics of the free energy principle? It explores different entity niche causal relationships. Like, for example, we could imagine a simple around the clock entity model. External states induce sensory states. One directional arrow, sensory goes into internal, internal to active, active to external, like an UDA loop or something like that, but just an around the clock, no bi directionality, no connection between active and sensory.
1586030	1654058	57	A	0.99942	26:26	153	Given this partitioning, one could imagine that topology of cause, one could imagine all kinds of topologies of cause, some that violate the Markov blanket condition, like internal states and external states that are no longer internal and external because they would have a causal link. But even preserving the Markov blanket condition, we could imagine different topologies, different sparsities of couplings between these different states. A bi directional arrow is kind of like there would be a non zero cause. And in the other side of the matrix, it would also be a non zero cause versus a unidirectional relationship where like variable two has a causal influence on three, but three doesn't have it on two. In this paper in Guest Room 7.1 and that paper and further line of research, they explore what sparse coupling structures, causal architectures of the entity niche relationship and interface would grant different statistical capacities.
1654234	1730106	58	A	0.52538	27:34	139	So I could be wrong on this, but active inference is not a commitment to this specific coupling architecture. It may be possible to design or describe or imagine systems that have different causal architectures, maybe even true at this basal most kernel loop, but certainly true when we start thinking about nested structures and cognitive structures and so on. So yes, it is a little unfortunate about this. However, this is just thinking about causal relationships of the particular partition and we're describing statistical relationships here causal influence, as inferred from like, time series data with Granger causality or other methods on specific random variables. So this is not the conversational notion of cause, but what I'm thinking is eventually resulting in things happening in the outside world, or aren't things in the outside world eventually changing things?
1730208	1745920	59	A	1.0	28:50	34	Yes, but just like the chessboard through time, the blanket is statistically intermediating. And again, that's why it gets so messy with the application of like well, the retina must be the sense states.
1749090	1794030	60	A	0.99999	29:09	101	If one can read that example and not fall into the quicksand, it could be didactic. But to tag retina as sense state is like the tip of the iceberg of a partially specified model, often one where the measurements have not actually occurred and so on. So then that can be extremely difficult for those with less familiarity with a formalism to generalize accurately from, because shouldn't it be like retina sense states and then the arm is the active state, but it's a partitioning that coinstantiates and it's model dependent, it's not describing features of the real world. Ollie?
1797830	1848606	61	C	0.51	29:57	105	Yeah, I just wanted to .1 of Ramset at All's recent fascinating paper on Bayesian mechanics, which I put the link in the chat. And in that paper, especially in section three, they have a very illuminating discussion about these whole business of partitioning and markup blankets. And one sentence that's pretty relevant to our discussion here is that the key point to note is that the flow of internal and active components I e. Their trajectory through state space does not depend upon external components. And reciprocally, the flow of external and sensory states or paths does not depend upon internal states or paths.
1848638	1870202	62	C	0.99999	30:48	38	From page 15. So yeah, if you refer to that article, it has been elaborated much explicitly. Also, in four days we will have Dalton and Maxwell et al. For a guest stream. The paper just came out.
1870256	1922570	63	A	1.0	31:10	127	Now we'll be able to have a discussion with them and learn and ask them questions. So if people have suggestions for guest streams, that can be accomplished. If people want to facilitate or participate in different streams, if they have questions for different streams. Being there live, but especially getting involved eagerly and actively and early is the biggest leverage point because that allows us to design the material so that it's, like permanently useful rather than potentially ad hoc questions that arise during which can be super important and hopefully people can see some affordances for participation and development. Let's just get to this last question and we have other questions, but these are essential and it's one of the opening formalisms of the chapter.
1924590	1930640	64	A	1.0	32:04	21	Just to conclude here though, why does independence between the flows on the two sides of the blanket matter so much?
1942210	1954450	65	A	0.99998	32:22	27	These are good things to think about. Just one short thought would be without independence between the flows, there is no distinguishing one thing from another. Ali.
1957380	2009324	66	C	0.92	32:37	92	And also I think it relates to what we read in chapter two about hidden states because that's what the word hidden probably refers to. I mean, internal state does not have direct access to external states and vice versa. So that Markup Blanket pretty much formalizes this hiddenness, yes, awesome. And partially observable models of the Bayesian type which are used in partially observable Markov decision processes, expectation maximization, any kind of Bayesian priors and hyper priors and so on. All of these have Bayes graphs that reflect conditionally independent variables.
2009452	2044104	67	A	0.99986	33:29	78	So it's not that they're independent in a conversational way, like they don't have any way of communicating, it's that they are specifically involved in a causal network that has conditional independence. But we'll hopefully develop more answers and notes here. We'll move on. What is the differences between and among the terms Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive processing, predictive coding and active inference? Might you be able to suggest references or resources for where these distinctions are delineated?
2044232	2086490	68	A	0.9999	34:04	89	Sure, so anyone can add more. But here's, I think two key resources here. The first is live stream 43. In 430, Maria gave a really excellent overview of predictive processing and predictive coding from a historical perspective. And briefly, she proposed that predictive coding can refer to a unidirectional data encoding scheme of the kind that we see in signal processing, video compression, so on, whereas predictive processing is referring to a bi directional architecture where predictive coding is implemented in this ongoing top down, bottom up way.
2087660	2123380	69	A	0.78709	34:47	78	Bayesian brain hypothesis was also touched on and we connected this to active inference. But 43.0 is a long technical review paper, but we have three discussions on it predictive coding, theoretical, experimental review, recent paper, very good source for the predictive processing encoding. And predictive processing encoding initially was more of about a sensory framework. However, at the end of that paper they show, okay, now we're going to do predictive processing on action. It's active inference.
2123880	2147870	70	A	0.99985	35:23	52	So predictive processing about action is six of one and half dozen of another within a margin of reasonable approximation, similar, but there's also some key differences like reliance on different formalisms. But these are all things for us to explore and unpack as we work on the ontology and so on.
2150240	2185944	71	A	0.5126	35:50	87	Specifically, predictive coding active inference in the Bayesian brain. This is an interview that a departed colleague and I did with Karl Friston in 2018 and we specifically asked the Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive coding and the free energy principle are often equated with one another. You yourself have suggested that the three frameworks are variations of the same basic mechanisms. So 2018 was a very different time. Active inference had not been delineated from FEP in the same way that it is coming to be now.
2186062	2211250	72	A	1.0	36:26	61	And there was a lot of other differences between then and now. But he gives an extended answer. So for people who want to learn about that, his extended answer and Martin's Restatement of the Bayesian brain hypothesis are still some of the best places to find clarity on that issue. Does anyone have any other thoughts or questions on this?
2215000	2254210	73	A	0.99	36:55	77	Just one other note, while anyone can raise their hand, is like the Bayesian brain hypothesis sometimes could be used in a very instrumentalist way. We're using Bayesian statistics to do neurobehavioral research. It might be a realist implementational claim, like the brain is doing Bayesian statistics or something like Bayesian statistics. So this hypothesis floats kind of among the layers of Mars analysis, like implementational algorithmic, computational. And people do use it to mean different things.
2254580	2278840	74	A	1.0	37:34	57	And in Bayesian graphs, in Bayesian statistics, it can be about perception or it could be about action. So Bayesian brain hypothesis, depending on how somebody frames it and what specific models they're talking about, might include, for example, all of these, because these might be applied in a Bayesian framework to talk about the brain. Ben.
2281580	2326208	75	D	1.0	38:01	122	Yeah, I think you've covered it really well, but I wish I'd have had access or knowledge of the result, the talk that you just mentioned. Because trying to differentiate predictive processing from active inference has been a kind of source of pain and confusion for me over the last few months. And I thought another way of putting it, perhaps because I think I know the difference now is essentially some presentations of predictive processing are active inference in the sense that they're highly embodied, inactive, embedded. And so if you have a predictive processing that draws on these Fourier accounts of cognition, it tends to just that just is active inference. Active inference is kind of necessarily inactive and embodied.
2326304	2362412	76	D	1.0	38:46	84	And there's a paper I should say there's a paper by I believe it's called Wilding the Predictive Brain. It's by Andy Clark, Kate Nave, Mark Miller and George Dean, I think, which basically takes predictive processing as a theory of neural processing and weaves in these kind of cognitive, these four E narratives really, really well and kind of fleshes out a much more active inferencey picture. The paper brings predictive process and active inference together really nicely, I think. Thanks. Great suggestion.
2362556	2425860	77	A	1.0	39:22	124	And just without going into too much detail, if this is the causal graph architecture of a predictive processing system, one can imagine that, like, Mu is being a Markov blanket with respect to these two epsilons or so on. So predictive processing doesn't highlight as much the Markov blanket. Formalism predictive processing is not a physics for particular systems like FEP is, but it's not incompatible. So maybe they're just different fingers pointing at similar or different parts of the moon. So there isn't an incompatibility, especially as over the recent years, active inference implemented predictive architectures and approaches, and predictive processing started to undergo that Pragmatic, inactive, four E, five E, whatever, infusion which led to them modeling action as a variable.
2426520	2444780	78	A	1.0	40:26	46	And so all they did was they just made it. So instead of the free energy being only about sensory observations. And expectations. They just tucked action in and it doesn't radically restructure the architecture. It just means that action is a variable in these equations.
2445120	2468390	79	A	0.78677	40:45	59	So 43.1 or zero, one and two are all good places to look. Okay, this was just a short question. Internal state and external state were added to the ontology. But sometimes, like, if you have a quotation mark and then an at, it won't bring it up. So sometimes you have to type it with an at first.
2470440	2509210	80	A	0.99	41:10	89	Okay, in our last 15 minutes, okay, these two are good. Maybe we could do a first pass on them and then in the coming week, like add notes and more questions to discuss. They wrote, if one defines preferred states as expected states, then one can say that living organisms must minimize the surprise of their sensory observations. I'm not clear on the ontology here. Is it that preference is the same as expectation or that formally we can use them in the same equation or something else?
2510460	2528670	81	A	0.99583	41:50	49	Does active inference make ontological claims like preference is actually expectation, just as heat is actually the excitation of molecules more generally? Is the free energy and physics just an analogy or is it an ontological assertion? Who would like to approach one of the aspects of this question?
2541720	2565230	82	G	0.91	42:21	58	I would like to take a stop, but again, I guess guess yes, please. I guess it's not saying that they're the same, but that if we're minimizing free energy, we're trying to make it the same. But if they're surprised, they won't be the same. I guess the goal is to get them as close as possible.
2567280	2585728	83	G	1.0	42:47	35	That will be my guess on this. Thank you. Good insight. I'll also point to two ways that expectation is conversationally used. The expectation with the fancy e is the expected mean of a distribution.
2585824	2607660	84	A	0.99613	43:05	58	Like, expected returns might be about the future, but it's actually referring to the mean estimate of a distribution. In the Gaussian case, the mean and the mode are the same. Mode seeking and mean seeking are equivalent. There can also be a variance estimator and so on. So the expectation of a Gaussian is like tremendously informative.
2608320	2613950	85	A	0.99234	43:28	11	Expectation can also mean things that are predicted about the future.
2617040	2633460	86	A	0.56315	43:37	43	That's a conversational. What do you expect it to be tomorrow? Both can be conjoined. Like what do you expect the temperature to be tomorrow? Is the expectation of a distribution of the uncertainty of the temperature distribution at the time point tomorrow.
2634040	2711162	87	A	0.99996	43:54	137	So they're not exclusive definitions. It just has to be understood what this means because it'd be like, well, if our predictions about the future are our preferences, then there's all kinds of tangles that one might find himself in. Also the I'm not remembering which number it was, but the dual usage of the same term to reflect the organism's preferred states and also the centering of the distribution at that time point and at other time points. And then just like jessica mentioned, this operation of free energy minimization is in service of reducing the divergence between the preferred state and the expectation of the preferred state, which could be set or learned, and then the observations that are coming in. So in one equation, it leans more towards the English description of a preference.
2711226	2735750	88	A	0.99981	45:11	46	Like the organism prefers to be at 72. And in the other sense, that is like the expectation of a distribution. And there's some observation distribution with a minimization of a divergence such that if the observations were realizing preferences, then those distributions would be aligned.
2737850	2769886	89	A	0.99638	45:37	55	So, yes, these terms are more like phenomena or natural language tags. Also, it'll be awesome. In the last two weeks of June, in 46, active inference models do not contradict folk psychology. This will be extended, extended discussions on, like, wanting beliefs, intentions. Which variables in active are appropriate for being described that way?
2770068	2793446	90	A	0.99993	46:10	53	Does it contradict one or the other? Those are like things that we'll explore. So the equations are just what they are. And then in some usages, a variable is like the organism's preferred states, what it's trying to reduce its divergence between. And also that is like, where it expects to be.
2793548	2831250	91	A	0.88	46:33	75	And that's what licenses the use of surprise and minimizing. Surprise because an observation right at the center of the Gaussian is minimally surprising. We talked about that in chapter two. An observation that's outside of the Gaussian is highly surprising. So if we have some sort of distribution of outcomes, we could ask how closely are they aligned with our preferences in terms of surprise due to this dual use of the same variables?
2832870	2844870	92	A	0.7835	47:12	28	Does active inference make ontological claims? Do theories make claims? Do people make claims? E. G preference is actually expectation, just as heat is actually excitation of molecules.
2847070	2849660	93	A	0.48829	47:27	8	Anyone can raise their hand at any time.
2852510	2891800	94	A	0.98961	47:32	91	We'll talk about that in the folk psychology. But it's an interesting question. Ben yeah, I wonder if it seems to me like these questions are taking us maybe into the map territory debate that I think we spoke about last time, about how realist or concrete should we think about the kind of ontological claims of active inference? It's certainly the last part of that question, I think, about whether we should take it as an analogy. So, yeah, I think it's quite a big question, but I don't know.
2895770	2934760	95	A	1.0	48:15	97	Okay, I won't find the slide here, but is the free energy in physics an analogy? Not sure if this is saying, like, the Gibbs free energy or if that's actually talking about the variational free energy or the expected free energy, which are statistical so I don't know if it's an analogy or an ontological assertion other than just to connect it to a linear model with a Gaussian Error distribution. Is that an ontological assertion that there is a Gaussian Error distribution in the world? No. So are statistical quantities ontological assertions about the world?
2936570	2939720	96	A	0.99999	48:56	8	Maybe there's some nuance, but broadly speaking, no.
2943690	2986210	97	A	1.0	49:03	93	And also, just like on the Math learning group, we've expanded our operation due to many active participants. So just note that the meetings are at 19 UTC on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. And they're in the discord voice chat, not in this gather. But we've been working on the resources on the notation, basic and background questions, as well as overviews of the math for different chapters, like basically just summarizing and then several people, and this is an example of the broken link. So, like variational, free energy is deleted.
2986290	3030930	98	A	0.99989	49:46	109	So just one time somebody has to come through and just add it back in. But these are natural language descriptions that will be very easy to transmute into computer code and translate amongst human languages and provides a lot of legibility and comprehensibility. So a lot of the math group has been modifying the equations and everybody is welcome to join those discord sessions and contribute with questions or with knowledge and expertise. Like, no matter where somebody is in learning or discussing these equations, they are the essence of active inference. So questions, random notes, related thoughts, expertise are all essential for us improving our shared understanding.
3031510	3075490	99	A	0.89	50:31	107	And then just in the last five minutes, page 42, they wrote in Advanced organisms, preferred states can also extend to learned cognitive goals and go on to say that advanced organisms like humans, can achieve preferred states by increasingly abstract social and cultural strategies. Like they talked about thermoregulation and then all the way up to, like, air conditioning distribution systems. My question is, if they are cast in terms of active inference, must all of these preferred states and strategies be ultimately linked to survival in some way? Or in the case of advanced organisms, can free energy be related to something other than survival?
3079440	3081470	100	A	0.99904	51:19	5	Mike and then anyone else?
3083520	3111770	101	E	0.65	51:23	63	Yeah, it feels like this notion of survival and preferred states gets conflated in a sort of odd way. Not everything is about survival. Right? And so you might have some measurement of surprise if you're in a temperature that's 120 degrees, but it's survivable for a period of time, whereas if you're in a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit, not survivable. Right.
3113020	3144992	102	E	0.89888	51:53	77	But if you contrast that with other things that could be equally surprising or outside the distribution, as you described it earlier, the notion of that all swans are white, but then you find a black swan. And so you'd never conceived that there might be a black swan before that lives outside your distribution and creates a surprise, but it's not necessarily survival rated. Thank you. There's sort of a missing severity in there somewhere. Okay.
3145046	3147120	103	A	0.88704	52:25	6	Thank you, Ollie. And then Lyle.
3149140	3182248	104	C	0.97	52:29	65	I think Live here is used somehow in a more direct way, meaning system that resists dispersion and energy dissipation. So it's not necessarily biological survival. Yes, great point. Systems that fail to persist, survive, will not continue to be that thing. And that's just in like a physical sense, repeated measurements are only enabled by systems that are persistent at that timescale, not eternally.
3182424	3197840	105	A	1.0	53:02	41	And so when we want to have a theory or a framework or a physics for things, then they have to look as if they are minimizing free energy. Otherwise they will simply not be that thing. Ben and then lyle.
3201720	3227550	106	B	0.99999	53:21	73	This was my question. I suppose just to kind of clarify it quickly. One of the things I wonder most about active inferences. It seems to me, at least in my life, I'm quite often making decisions and having preferences that seem so abstracted from my attunement with my environment or my continued viability as a system. Like my preference for which mug I'm going to drink coffee out of in the morning.
3227920	3256960	107	D	1.0	53:47	60	It seems in some sense removed from my free energy the way that free energy is described in the literature. That's kind of what I meant. Great. In yesterday's 45.2 we asked specifically, like, how can all behavior be optimal when mistakes are made? Or I'll be asked the question, like, what about when there's like sacrificial or altruistic behavior?
3257120	3313380	108	A	0.91	54:17	116	And there's a great answer in 45.2, but suffice to say that with different priors, all behavior can be cast as optimal behavior. So the normativity isn't referring to what should be done or what is best, but it's rather like a process normativity. Lyle right, yeah. This for me tees up the question I continue to have about the approach, which is how does the concept of novelty, which some organisms would pursue, fit into this concept of I mean, how would it even be represented here? And novelty is not just a human trait, but you would see it across all kinds of creatures that would seek out novel and surprising experience, not expected.
3313540	3344140	109	B	0.99462	55:13	67	So for me, it's kind of an open question about how that's captured in this framework. Yes, the beginning and ending of 45.2 carl's focus was on curiosity and there's various ways to approach it. And it's an excellent question about novelty of different types and scales. And within the hierarchical modeling, one can understand novelty of different kinds. And this again is just like the kernel.
3344220	3374600	110	A	0.99999	55:44	69	This is like the single linear regression. And then there's like model selection across hierarchically nested linear models, much development beyond the kernel. But this is like a kernel. And especially when thinking about expected free energy, a path can move to a novel area because it's part of an expected trajectory that does reduce risk and ambiguity and so on. So that's the deflationary approach to novelty pursuit.
3374760	3378060	111	A	0.80755	56:14	7	Jessica and then we'll end the discussion.
3383650	3424922	112	G	0.97	56:23	70	At the end. You mentioned it. I guess I see novelty as sort of like the epistemic origin. And so it's like you are seeking new information, new things, in order to minimize that uncertainty. Not so much that novelty is uncertainty, because if we look at Nova's thinking that, oh, it's new and therefore it's going to be surprising and so we want to minimize those things then yes.
3425056	3472140	113	G	0.97	57:05	102	Or also if we look at uncertainty equal to risk, we can say like novelty is because of the unknown represented risk and if we're minimizing uncertainty, we're trying to minimize risk. But from what I saw a little bit on chapter two, it's sort of like we're not necessarily trying to minimize risk or the unknown. Depending on our preferences, we might tolerate high risk. And what we're trying to minimize is the surprise of what we expect. If I'm in finance, and I expect very high risk in an investment, but I already know that and high risk comes back.
3473870	3521686	114	G	0.99967	57:53	117	My uncertainty was minimized, even though there was a lot of risk or there were a lot of unknowns or novelty and things like that. But it was already in my expectation of what was going to happen. So I was already minimizing that, even though in reality it may look like that there was a lot of uncertainty in actuality, but in my model there isn't. So that's kind of like how I explained that to me a little bit and in terms of novelty for adventure and curiosity and things like that, I equated more to epistemic foraging as a weight of learning and updating the model and that's why we're doing it. Thanks, Jessica.
3521798	3578282	115	A	0.99985	58:41	132	I'll just add one closing note on that. I would argue that it's the pragmatic absolutism, the reinforcement and reward learning centrism that has curtailed an effective theory of novelty or curiosity because radically different kinds of actions have to be coerced into a value framework, whether it's deep Q learning or reinforcement or anything like that. There has to be like a novelty bonus or all these other ad hoc unprincipled approaches. They might be super technical, they might be super effective, but they're not driven from first principles in variational free energy f and expected free energy g. There's this minimum of two with pragmatic value which is to bring alignment between the preferences and the observations and the epistemic value associated with what is casually called novelty or curiosity.
3578426	3625690	116	A	1.0	59:38	115	At that scale of potentially a hierarchical model, So active inference does provide partitioning and an imperative that helps us address the phenomena of curiosity and of novelty in a way that is quite disparate from trying to coerce it into a value of curiosity. Is expected pragmatic value or the value of basic research is the expected utility that it could bring. But these are all really awesome and open and ongoing questions. So we will close the recording and then have just a 1 minute break. Then in this room we'll continue with tools, organizational unit and if anybody wants to talk about something else, they can go to a different gather room.
3625760	3629880	117	A	0.99621	1:00:25	9	So thanks everybody and see you next week. Thanks.
