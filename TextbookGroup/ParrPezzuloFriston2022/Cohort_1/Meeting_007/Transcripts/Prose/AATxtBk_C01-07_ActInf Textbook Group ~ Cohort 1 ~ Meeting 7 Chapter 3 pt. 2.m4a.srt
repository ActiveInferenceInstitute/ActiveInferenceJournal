00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,474
Hello, everyone. It is June 16,

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:08,046
2022, and it's meeting seven of the

3
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:10,394
active textbook textbook group Cohort

4
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:13,678
one. We're in our second discussion of

5
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:18,366
chapter three today.

6
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:21,870
We'll be looking at the questions that

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,662
haven't been addressed, so the ones

8
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:27,510
without thumbs. And also,

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,590
it's not too late to add more questions

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,998
or to upvote questions. And then

11
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:36,822
additionally, since the Math Learning

12
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:40,810
Group has been quite active in

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,362
providing synchronous affordances for

14
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,274
conversation around some of the

15
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:49,878
background on the Math as well as some

16
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:51,566
aspects of the equations that we'll go

17
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:54,894
through today and also even to

18
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,386
applications of the math and developing

19
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:58,720
notebooks and such.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,434
We'll take a look at the math in

21
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:07,300
our move through chapter three.

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,114
Before we go to the questions, does

23
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:12,626
anyone have anything that they just want

24
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,900
to remark on chapter three,

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,720
Ali and then anyone else?

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,574
Yeah. Well, last week I talked about how

27
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:27,414
I changed my mind about these bottom up

28
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:29,834
and top down characterizations of low

29
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:32,554
road and high road, respectively, after

30
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,354
reading chapter three, but it turns out

31
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:37,866
that they are, in fact, bottom up and

32
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:40,574
top down approaches after all. You see,

33
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:43,642
I came across this, in my opinion,

34
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:45,918
undeservedly lesser known piece of

35
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,026
beautiful, beautiful writing by Karl

36
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:51,022
Frisden which explicitly argues for such

37
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,902
characterizations and the philosophical

38
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:57,166
importance of this distinction. It's

39
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,402
called beyond the Desert Landscape, and

40
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,554
it's inconspicuously hidden in this

41
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:06,146
book, Andy Clark and his critics.

42
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:10,134
So I'd like to quote a couple

43
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,870
of sentences from this writing.

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,442
Well, he writes quote the high road

45
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,722
stands in for a top down approach that

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,898
starts by asking fundamental questions

47
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:24,682
about the necessary properties things

48
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,162
must possess if they exist. Using

49
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,606
mathematical variational principles,

50
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:32,334
one can then show that existence is an

51
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:35,342
embodied exchange of a creature with its

52
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,674
environment that necessarily entails

53
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:40,126
predictive processing as one aspect of a

54
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:42,842
self evidencing mechanics. The low road

55
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,890
is the purpose. The agenda established

56
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,282
is to pursue the agenda established by

57
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,906
Kant and Hellholtz and generalize in a

58
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,374
bottom up way, the capacity for

59
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:58,982
inference and prediction to see how far

60
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:01,234
it takes us in understanding embodied

61
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,182
exchange with the environment. So if

62
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:07,346
anyone likes to gain a deeper

63
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,090
understanding about these conceptual

64
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,966
characterizations, I highly, highly

65
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:16,300
recommend this chapter of this book.

66
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,830
And quite unusually for Frison writing,

67
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,874
it also lacks any mathematical

68
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:27,422
formalism. It doesn't include a single

69
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:29,440
mathematical equation there.

70
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,366
Thank you. Yeah. In a recent

71
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,430
stream, we also talked about the desert

72
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,690
landscape. And Clark's concern was that

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,580
we might do away with what populates are

74
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,834
implicitly assumed to be rich ecosystems

75
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:52,342
of psychology, philosophy and so on,

76
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:56,038
with important ecosystem players like

77
00:03:56,204 --> 00:04:00,534
goals. And so the fear

78
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:03,274
or concern was that we might be in a

79
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:07,050
quineyan desert landscape. If we replace

80
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,994
some of these, again, implicitly or

81
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,506
explicitly stated, to be rich constructs

82
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:13,898
like goals, and we're like, well, it's

83
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:17,130
just distribution matching, then we've

84
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,554
made some sort of like a desert

85
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:22,186
monoculture. And that would be depoprant

86
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,954
of what does Clark say to

87
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:27,570
his desert living critics?

88
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,978
All right, if anyone else has a

89
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:34,082
thought, they can raise their hand.

90
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:36,520
Otherwise we can look at the questions.

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,774
Okay, so this first question if

92
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:45,266
one defines preferred states as expected

93
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:47,714
states, one can say living organisms

94
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,386
must minimize the surprise of their

95
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:52,538
sensory observations. I'm not clear on

96
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:55,366
the ontology here. Is it that preference

97
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,514
is the same as expectation or that

98
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,034
formally we can use them in the same

99
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:02,270
equation? Is that an ontological claim?

100
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,166
And is the free Energy and physics an

101
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,706
analogy or an ontological assertion

102
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,680
about how things really are?

103
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,980
So one starting place was

104
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,554
I found the slide and so wanted to

105
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:20,914
highlight it. This was in Free Energy,

106
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,326
a user's guide which was live. Stream

107
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:24,340
number 37.

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,390
The slides will be probably a little

109
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,190
bigger.

110
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,358
It's worth restating just how unusual it

111
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:36,582
is to interpret P as a measure of both

112
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,914
probabilities and preferences. They both

113
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,754
start with P, though there's nothing

114
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,418
wrong with treating a distribution as a

115
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:45,162
measure of preferences because

116
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,490
distributions can have different

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,794
interpretations. But what's unorthodox

118
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,854
and in need of justification is giving

119
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,862
the same mathematical term two different

120
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,798
interpretations within the same

121
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:57,710
equation.

122
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,002
They then add some more details that

123
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:06,706
unpack a little bit about how it

124
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,590
is the case that the same term,

125
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,080
P can be utilized as

126
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,190
both a probability and a preference.

127
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,854
And then they even extended it into a

128
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:29,690
third P, the, the PH fitness,

129
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,534
where by allowing your probabilities

130
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:36,506
and your preferences to converge to

131
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,922
reduce the divergence between those two

132
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:43,514
distributions, then fitness

133
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:44,590
is achieved.

134
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,830
And so they provided a

135
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,362
restatement of the way that that is

136
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:57,246
implemented and then highlighted

137
00:06:57,278 --> 00:07:00,734
in additional grounding or interpretive

138
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,380
line.

139
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,558
So that's at

140
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,320
least one part of that question.

141
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,290
And also to look towards the equations.

142
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,540
It's something that we'll be able to

143
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,354
have very clear answers for and thanks

144
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,170
to the work of Ali and Blue and others

145
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,970
who have been annotating equations.

146
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,262
So for example, in equation 3.1,

147
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:38,840
or we can look at like box one,

148
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,098
equation one, which is like a Markov

149
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,270
blanket definition.

150
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,994
In the description field we

151
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:55,290
have a natural language description

152
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,014
and then the terms that are used in

153
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,230
the description are those that are

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,854
referenced using variables. So that will

155
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:09,774
help us translate across natural

156
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,050
language of different human languages,

157
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,594
the discrete and continuous time

158
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,334
formalisms which we're going to explore

159
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:20,638
in this textbook, also identical

160
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,894
or isomorphic or related formalisms in

161
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:26,790
other papers which sometimes are using

162
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,494
the same notation letters, but not

163
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:32,594
always. But we could have another column

164
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:36,566
for first in 2019 and here's first in

165
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:39,338
2013 and then there's a conversation to

166
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,350
be had about where they align or don't.

167
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,162
And that's the kind of annotation work

168
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:44,986
that somebody can engage in from the

169
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,054
publications and that also helps us

170
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:48,970
connect it to the programmatic

171
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,186
implementations like in Active Block,

172
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:55,390
for instance, or in other scripts.

173
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,666
So that even that we can promote norms

174
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:01,602
and practices around variable naming in

175
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:05,538
math and in programming, but also where

176
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:07,326
there is divergences or differences

177
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:09,234
which are important for innovating and

178
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:12,438
evolving the norms. We can also map them

179
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:15,042
pretty coherently so all the equations

180
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:21,000
for three can be read

181
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,438
naturally. So we discussed this a lot in

182
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:26,234
the math group and again, a lot of

183
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:29,466
people contributed to this with one of

184
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:31,754
the goals or functions being that

185
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,226
whenever we are going to bring up an

186
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,450
equation, like if there's a question

187
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,760
about equation 3.1.

188
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,480
We can just briefly read

189
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,910
the current state of the description.

190
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,014
Because whether you're super familiar

191
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:50,786
with the letters and variables and how

192
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:54,286
they're concatenated, or whether it's

193
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,202
just like a first pass on your seeing

194
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:00,498
this equation. Everybody will

195
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,646
benefit when we align our regime of

196
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,240
attention to actually what it says,

197
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,782
and then that will help us do many,

198
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:08,920
many other things.

199
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,790
But to return back to this question,

200
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,188
does anyone want to raise their hand and

201
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:23,196
give a thought on the relationship

202
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:25,100
between preference and expectation?

203
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,880
Ontological claims about preference

204
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,480
and its relationship with expectation

205
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,280
and more generally,

206
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,824
is the free energy something that

207
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:45,120
is an analogy or mathematical

208
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,092
isomorphism or an equation that rhymes

209
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,960
or is it also an assertion?

210
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,960
It it's an equation that rhymes.

211
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,584
What makes you say that? No, just

212
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:04,356
because it's

213
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:05,450
cute, that's all.

214
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,468
I just joined the conversation. But

215
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,944
preference and expectation, I wouldn't

216
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:17,256
think they were at all referring

217
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:18,370
to the same thing.

218
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,000
Expectation is a mathematical operator.

219
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,564
Preference is a

220
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:33,910
statement. Yes.

221
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,910
Expectation is used in multiple ways.

222
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,580
It can refer to predictions about

223
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,444
the mean or the mode or other attributes

224
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:47,636
of a future time point like I'm

225
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,976
expecting, what are you expecting to

226
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:53,208
happen on next Monday? Also,

227
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:55,436
expectation can refer and that's how

228
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,436
it's used with the fancy e to refer to

229
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:03,592
the expected value of a distribution

230
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,464
which for a gaussian is the mode

231
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:10,080
in the center of a symmetric peak.

232
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,216
And that doesn't need to be about a

233
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,984
future time point, that can just be the

234
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:19,408
expectation of the height of the

235
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:22,244
classroom. Right now it's not saying

236
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,036
that's what we're expecting it to be in

237
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:26,532
a year as it might be used

238
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,436
conversationally but it's referring to

239
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,500
just like the average of a distribution.

240
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,292
Right? Mathematically it's an operator

241
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,050
and verbally it. Can be.

242
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,010
A prediction or a desire or something.

243
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,924
Yes. And then again in 37 and

244
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:53,256
elsewhere it'll

245
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,596
be worth returning to this again and

246
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,060
again because it's one of the essential

247
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,276
architectural decisions in active

248
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:07,740
inference that enable it's

249
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,040
part of the necessity and sufficiency

250
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,710
complex. I don't know whether this is

251
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,276
the whole meat of it, but it's part of

252
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:20,272
what allows the dispensal of an explicit

253
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:24,372
reward term, like a homeostatic

254
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,980
reinforcement. Reward driven learner

255
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,624
would be like, I'm more rewarded by

256
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,504
being in my homeostatic range. And then

257
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,212
there needs to be this architecture

258
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:35,992
around. Well, how are we going to pursue

259
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:39,740
reward? Alternatively,

260
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,064
an organism trying to maintain

261
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:46,716
homeostasis realism or us modeling an

262
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,020
organism that is maintaining homeostasis

263
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,760
instrumentalism. We can just say it

264
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,716
expects to be in the range.

265
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,256
That conversationally we're going to

266
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,248
describe as a preference. How do we

267
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,076
know? We put the animal in the room and

268
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,900
it's spending a lot of its time on this

269
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,436
warmer side. It prefers to be

270
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,652
there. We also expect it to be there.

271
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:13,496
We're less surprised when we see it

272
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:17,396
there. So then it's

273
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,948
possible to as they right here interpret

274
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:24,616
that p location distribution in the

275
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,312
room for the animal that we're observing

276
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,108
or the temperature distribution for the

277
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:31,804
body in the homeostatic context as being

278
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:34,172
a probability density over.

279
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:38,030
Temperatures over locations as well as

280
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,016
reflecting the preferences, not the

281
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,432
qualia or the phenomenology or anything

282
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:47,216
like too far out about what it means to

283
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,184
prefer where preferences arise from,

284
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,656
whether they're fixed or learned in the

285
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:53,156
model. All these many, many trails that

286
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:56,390
can come out of that. But just at this

287
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,484
essential layer, we don't need to

288
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:03,384
interpolate a reward term between what

289
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:06,520
is expected and what is preferred.

290
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,684
Any other comments from someone? Yes,

291
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:17,290
Eric, and then anyone else?

292
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,810
Yeah, just to remark on that,

293
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,928
it seems you're still not removing the

294
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:28,296
free variable of what the preference of

295
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,804
the agent organism is. You're just

296
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,908
holding it. You're putting it in a

297
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:35,836
different place so that you can use it

298
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:39,724
in this unified equation. But you

299
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:42,860
still have this it's a free variable.

300
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,688
What do you want to do? Okay, I'm going

301
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,028
to call that an expectation. And that's

302
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,384
what I'm going to try to drive for when

303
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:52,130
I optimize my variational, free energy.

304
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,716
But in that sense, it's kind of a

305
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:57,668
convenience or it's a trick. It's a

306
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:59,556
little bit of an unnatural act. I don't

307
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:02,196
know the way I think of it, for a

308
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:02,900
purpose.

309
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,152
But you haven't solved any other

310
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:13,880
problem. The deeper problem of what

311
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,756
should the organism attempt to achieve

312
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:17,800
the goals.

313
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,900
Yes. Thanks, Ali.

314
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,776
Well, I think it also might be quite

315
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:37,184
helpful to refer back to chapter two on

316
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:45,090
page 36, I think. Yeah, page 36 here

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,884
they have actually distinguished between

318
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:52,084
the term prediction and exactly. Yes.

319
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:55,760
Here the term prediction and expectation

320
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,460
quite explicitly in terms of equation

321
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,730
2.6.

322
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,290
Okay. So let's look at equation 2.6.

323
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,930
Okay. A few of them,

324
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,096
we don't have the third line fully

325
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:20,172
described, but just here's the third

326
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:23,036
line. What does this speak to with

327
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,180
respect to preferences and expectations?

328
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,768
Here the preference actually is in the

329
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:37,072
second term, the Kullback Leibler

330
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,870
divergence. Here. Yeah.

331
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,852
It's actually inherent in the second

332
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:47,184
term. And the expectation, expected

333
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,500
ambiguity, as it speaks for itself

334
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,976
is the first term. So we have here the

335
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:58,212
risk is defined as the divergence

336
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,084
between the preference and the states.

337
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:04,076
So I think that we can see the

338
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:07,950
preference in this equation as well.

339
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,432
One note here is like that this G is

340
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:16,850
equal to the first, the second,

341
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,010
and this line.

342
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,816
But one way that we can understand the

343
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,564
relationship of the second and the third

344
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:29,204
line is like they're very similar. The

345
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,740
first term is identical here.

346
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,204
The only difference is that instead of a

347
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:37,350
Y, we see an X.

348
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,756
And so this is like X being the hidden

349
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,760
state and Y being the observation.

350
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,236
In the case where it's a fully

351
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:49,130
observable Markov process,

352
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,540
then the outcomes and the hidden states

353
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,424
are going to be like equal uncertainty

354
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:58,092
about them. Because in that case

355
00:18:58,146 --> 00:18:59,852
it's functionally that the hidden states

356
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,888
are observables. However, if there's any

357
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:05,324
amount of ambiguity like the a matrix

358
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:06,944
between the hidden state and the

359
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:10,288
observable, then there's always going to

360
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:12,524
be more uncertainty about the hidden

361
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:15,520
state relative to the observable.

362
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,020
And then importantly, on both sides

363
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,132
there's a conditioning vertical line on

364
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:27,924
policy selection. And so that

365
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:29,732
is what prevents us from getting into

366
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,544
the like, well, what if it's 95% correct

367
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,864
or 96 or 97% correct or any of these

368
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:37,732
sort of like model diminishing returns

369
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,656
debates. It's a functional that's

370
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:45,132
calculated for each policy that have

371
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,584
been possible of composing

372
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:50,796
given the affordances. A policy is just

373
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,616
a sequence of actions. So if there's

374
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:56,192
four movement affordances, there's four

375
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:59,212
policies of time depth one, there's 16

376
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:01,648
policies of time depth two, and so on

377
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,964
and for whatever in this discrete,

378
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,704
formalism, finite set of policies,

379
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,924
there are they're evaluated here and

380
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:13,652
then there's a policy selection that

381
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:16,404
could choose the lowest expected free

382
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:17,996
energy, or it could proportionally

383
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,896
choose from them with different kinds of

384
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,488
weighting and so on. But this is

385
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:24,756
comparing the relative expected

386
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:28,420
ambiguity and risk conditioned upon

387
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,396
different specific policies. And there's

388
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,036
a process by which those specific

389
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:36,076
policies can be enumerated and then this

390
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:37,708
is a process by which they're going to

391
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:40,188
be evaluated and then there's a policy

392
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:43,810
selection by which they're selected. So

393
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,464
organisms that fail to do this

394
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:49,280
adequately enough will be dissipated.

395
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,504
Or systems, whether it's just a

396
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,652
molecular system or some other kind of

397
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:58,372
statistical system that fail to do this

398
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:01,124
well enough to remain being that kind of

399
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:04,336
thing, are not amenable to repeated

400
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:07,204
measurements. They are not that thing.

401
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,672
But things that remain being that thing

402
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:12,040
for the time horizon of observations

403
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,528
will be selecting policies that are

404
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:16,970
consistent with this.

405
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,756
Can I ask a question about this? Yeah,

406
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:25,292
about this equation here, say like

407
00:21:25,346 --> 00:21:26,430
the second line.

408
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,444
So first of all, see the preferences is

409
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,672
not really spelled out very much in this

410
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,176
chapter and I don't know where it will

411
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:39,456
be, but I would

412
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:41,312
have expected something more like

413
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:45,040
preferences given observations like

414
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,936
the observations, what's happened in the

415
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,516
world that we can measure that's

416
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:50,850
observation. Why?

417
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,836
And then how does that fit with my

418
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,592
preferences? So what I want to optimize

419
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:59,016
is my preference, the achievement of my

420
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,456
preferences as delivered by the

421
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:05,704
observations. Now, I understand that

422
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,504
in that second equation you're going to

423
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:12,140
do a divergence between observations,

424
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,572
the Y tilde. So you can't flip around p

425
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,764
of C given y tilde there. So can

426
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,376
somebody explain to me how this all fits

427
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,964
together then? How do you achieve

428
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:26,560
preferences under that equation?

429
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,496
I'll give one thought and I

430
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,736
absolutely agree to the first point,

431
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:37,376
which is like c is just like I don't

432
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:40,964
even know if it's described in this

433
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:44,740
chapter. 34,

434
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,670
I think. 34,

435
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,890
let me check it again.

436
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,748
I mean there is he said parameter.

437
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,004
Includes preferences but it includes

438
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:03,356
parameter. Yeah. And also if

439
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:07,150
you go to section 7.4 I think

440
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,040
yes, in that section

441
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,892
it is untangled why these two parameters

442
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:16,812
are related and how these two parameters

443
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,370
are related to each other.

444
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,364
That's like multiple scales of where the

445
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:30,244
information is not provided before when

446
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:33,428
it needs to be provided. Which is like

447
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:36,496
this I have made as just a helpful

448
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,404
diagram of the partially observable

449
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:41,336
Markov decision process which is C is

450
00:23:41,358 --> 00:23:44,728
the preferences and it influences how G

451
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:47,124
evaluates policies which are generated

452
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,112
from affordances over a given time

453
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,056
horizon. Policies intervene upon how

454
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:54,748
hidden states change in the world and

455
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,204
there's more in different readings. But

456
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:59,116
to return to Eric's question and then

457
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,004
again, anyone with the raised hand so

458
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:04,460
the question was whether we're comparing

459
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,368
outcomes or states, how does

460
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:12,112
this second term help us realize our

461
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,408
preference? Well,

462
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:18,352
when is the KL? We're trying to minimize

463
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,012
g of pi better policies have a lower

464
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:24,916
score. It's like golf, I guess, or you

465
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,916
could add negatives and make it higher.

466
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,780
And also just it's an interesting note

467
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,924
like climbing Mount Improbable,

468
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:34,052
biologists often think about the fitness

469
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:37,092
peak and climbing to fitness peaks,

470
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,112
whereas for a physicist it's often

471
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,696
framed. And also like computer science

472
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:45,672
gradient descending and local minima,

473
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:49,740
global minima, but they're just actually

474
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,676
like the same landscape with some

475
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,656
negative signs. So the KL divergence and

476
00:24:54,678 --> 00:24:57,116
here we're trying to minimize if it's

477
00:24:57,148 --> 00:25:00,032
zero that would mean like we are

478
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:03,680
perfectly realizing our preference.

479
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,008
So let's just say that there's two

480
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,152
policies that we're comparing between

481
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:11,184
and one of them is going to perfectly

482
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:13,252
realize our preferences, the other one

483
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:16,020
isn't. So we have like pi one and pi two

484
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,788
and we're going to be calculating the KL

485
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,596
divergence of the outcomes that we're

486
00:25:20,628 --> 00:25:22,084
expecting under the variational

487
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:25,032
distribution Q under policy one and

488
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:29,128
under policy two. So if policy

489
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:33,436
one is going to perfectly realize if

490
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:36,616
the outcomes of policy one are expected

491
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,968
to perfectly realize our preferences,

492
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:40,830
this term will be zero.

493
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,664
Whereas if policy two is going to be

494
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:48,844
expected to result in an outcome

495
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:51,136
distribution that's not aligned with our

496
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,452
preferences, it doesn't get penalized

497
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:57,308
here. This is just evaluated as

498
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:00,452
a value. Nor does it get penalized here

499
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,128
because in this case of fixed

500
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,564
preferences that's also not changing as

501
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,708
we iterate through policies. However,

502
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:08,408
there would be a divergence that would

503
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:10,810
be nonzero. Like all divergences are

504
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,056
between the inferior policy and the

505
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:17,160
superior policy. So by iterating over

506
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,770
the finite set of policies that we have

507
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,388
taking this term and just leaving it to

508
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:24,824
the side. For now, only the KL

509
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:27,660
divergence. This will lead us to select

510
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,276
policies that can be expected to bring

511
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:33,500
alignment between the observations

512
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,664
conditioned on policy and our

513
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:37,484
preferences. Preferred outcome

514
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:40,896
distribution. Thank you, that's very

515
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:42,704
helpful. So just to kind of say that

516
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,736
slightly differently is given your

517
00:26:44,758 --> 00:26:47,844
preferences, that's going to imply some

518
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:50,596
outcomes. And what you're trying to do

519
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:52,356
with that KL divergence is you're trying

520
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,808
to get the policy that will achieve

521
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,980
those outcomes.

522
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,460
So if we expect and prefer

523
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,684
to be within the homeostatic thermal

524
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:08,968
range and then the two policies in the

525
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,544
snowstorm are add the jacket or remove

526
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:15,244
the jacket, which one of those

527
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:19,224
are expected to have the minimum

528
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:20,908
divergence between us being in the

529
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:24,412
homeostatic range and then the policy

530
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:27,760
conditioned expected outcomes?

531
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,048
I'm going to have less divergence. It

532
00:27:30,054 --> 00:27:31,216
doesn't even mean you're going to live.

533
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,672
It just means I'm going to have less

534
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:35,856
divergence by having the jacket on in

535
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:38,164
the snowstorm than by taking it off,

536
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:39,936
which is going to move the expected

537
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:42,036
outcome distribution further from the

538
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:44,244
preference distribution, which here is

539
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:46,900
fixed, but doesn't have to be fixed.

540
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,770
Okay,

541
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:05,804
so we have several is

542
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:08,424
anyone here the person who has written

543
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:09,868
any of these questions? And then we can

544
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:11,150
just go to that one.

545
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,900
Lyle?

546
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,552
Yes. There we go. I think I'm on here.

547
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:28,370
Okay, so yeah, I wrote the one that

548
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,956
is referring to the living organisms and

549
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,724
the question about to what extent are

550
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:38,676
these techniques valuable in what

551
00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:41,072
I would call social systems of wide

552
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,856
ranging sorts. And I know

553
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:48,164
that this book at the outset limits

554
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:51,144
itself to biological systems, at least

555
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:52,328
that's my recollection from the

556
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:55,340
introduction, but it just seems obvious

557
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,912
to me that this would have much broader

558
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:02,396
applicability. I'm curious what

559
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:03,790
the state of that is.

560
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,270
Well,

561
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,836
do I hesitate to put anyone on the spot?

562
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:14,636
John, would you give a first response

563
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:16,720
there while I add some resources?

564
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,790
Yeah, my first thought on that is

565
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,380
obviously our civilization is struggling

566
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,536
and civilizations have failed in the

567
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,192
past who collapsed. So it's not

568
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:38,536
necessarily the case that every social

569
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:41,592
structure or societal structure is

570
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,128
actually performing functional active

571
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:48,664
inference. But if we were a highly

572
00:29:48,712 --> 00:29:50,876
functional organism, if societies were a

573
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:53,244
highly functional organism, we would be

574
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:55,176
doing something like active inference

575
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:58,368
and learning from our mistakes and

576
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:01,680
making sure that we put ourselves in an

577
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,848
environment that is sustainable and all

578
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:07,744
that kind of stuff. So my first thought

579
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:10,340
is, I think that all of this is

580
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,396
applicable to societal systems, but it

581
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:15,812
doesn't necessarily mean that any

582
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,924
existing societal systems actually

583
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:21,060
perform functional active inference.

584
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,210
Yeah, thanks. It's almost like saying,

585
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,216
hey, we're studying the penguins and

586
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:31,544
their thermostats and homeostats. This

587
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,628
model could be parameterized to fit a

588
00:30:34,654 --> 00:30:37,500
thriving or a failing society along

589
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,996
various different dimensions. And so in

590
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:42,184
the sense that this is like a linear

591
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:44,716
aggression that can capture failing as

592
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:47,056
well as succeeding societies. Yes, the

593
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,792
Nested Markov blanket formalism has

594
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,756
qualitatively, but increasingly

595
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:54,204
quantitatively been applied. And there's

596
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,056
multiple startups and applications that

597
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:59,368
are explicitly pursuing this angle.

598
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,572
It's been brought up for several years

599
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:05,376
now and in 2020 several

600
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:08,180
of us wrote about it being applied to

601
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,092
remote teams and organizations and

602
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:13,480
communities. I can add these links to

603
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,704
decentralized science as a system and

604
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:19,144
ecosystem. So yes, people have

605
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:21,944
started to sketch that continent out and

606
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:24,410
there's a lot more to understand.

607
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,012
What do you think, Lyle? Yeah,

608
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:30,556
I think that makes a ton of sense. I

609
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:33,036
think obviously, I guess the way I was

610
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,644
thinking about the question is not so

611
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:38,432
much whether to what extent social

612
00:31:38,486 --> 00:31:40,652
systems do this because social systems

613
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:42,064
so you could take two points of view.

614
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:45,280
One is you could say social systems are

615
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,864
behaving cognitively in the ways that

616
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:52,470
we're discussing. In other words,

617
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,644
there are preferred states that are

618
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,412
driving behavior. Now, we could say

619
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:01,552
those preferred states are the wrong

620
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,880
states for whatever reasons.

621
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,704
So there's a question between what we

622
00:32:09,742 --> 00:32:13,016
actually in any particular social system

623
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:14,844
was actually happening, which I would

624
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:17,484
argue could be described through this

625
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:20,988
technique, or what they should be doing,

626
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,924
which we could also describe through

627
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:26,552
this technique. Right? So I think

628
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:28,044
it's important to have that distinction.

629
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:31,104
And there's a really long history of

630
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:35,520
using dynamic systems models to explore

631
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,656
those questions, especially in the

632
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:41,092
business context. That's mostly how I

633
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:44,160
made my living through the decades.

634
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,004
So that sort

635
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:51,124
of as is to be or would

636
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:53,464
prefer to be sort of questioned. It just

637
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:56,760
seems like this technique would

638
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,060
potentially be a significant advance

639
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,656
over the tools in that space that

640
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:03,828
currently exists, which are primarily

641
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:06,044
things like system dynamics and agent

642
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:08,412
based modeling, stuff like that. But

643
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:12,124
this would seem to have the potential to

644
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:15,052
look at things as they are, why is it

645
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:18,496
broken and what we might do. Yes,

646
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,928
so I have added several other

647
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:23,344
references. It's important. And the

648
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,596
book, again, is like, if it's describing

649
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,456
the linear model, then there's the

650
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:30,032
applications of the linear model and as

651
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:32,244
people and as John brought up, like many

652
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:35,216
times in this series of live streams

653
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:36,836
that we did, together with four with

654
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:38,576
just the two of us, with John leading

655
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,268
through basically the entire thread of

656
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:43,384
this discussion of three papers and then

657
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:46,216
two more group discussions. There's been

658
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:50,184
recent work on scripts by Mahault and

659
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,804
colleagues with a strong and a weak

660
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:55,084
script formalization, like a strong

661
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,644
script being when the norms are

662
00:33:57,682 --> 00:33:59,452
practiced, like in a ritualistic way,

663
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:01,532
like reading from a script, versus the

664
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:04,364
looser script concept, which could

665
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:07,048
include just norms and social practice.

666
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:09,576
And then more recently they're modeling

667
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:12,224
work using Pi MDP to talk about

668
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:15,808
epistemic communities. And then some of

669
00:34:15,814 --> 00:34:18,736
the very earliest live streams that we

670
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:20,772
did were on narrative, human

671
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:23,460
communication, cultural affordances.

672
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,116
So these are absolutely topics that have

673
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:28,308
been addressed, although many of the

674
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:31,404
earlier works are like here's

675
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,864
people in the world, we're going to use

676
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:37,450
active inference to model it. But then

677
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,856
there's so much more beyond that.

678
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,972
It's almost like a 1950s cybernetics

679
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,604
book. Well, we can just imagine that the

680
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,076
person is going to be involved in this

681
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:51,628
feedback loop, but then that's not the

682
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:54,668
end of the discussion on that. Ali and

683
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:55,470
then, John.

684
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,872
I just wanted to mention that, well,

685
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,696
FEP can potentially be applied to

686
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:09,360
any dynamical system with Ergodicity,

687
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,830
because you see,

688
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,860
any system with Ergotic behavior

689
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,620
have some points of attraction, some

690
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,704
attractors that all

691
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:27,370
the other states are converging to. So

692
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,840
it's pretty general. And well,

693
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,750
almost all dynamical systems we know of

694
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,460
on different timescales can be

695
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,280
potentially modeled with FEP

696
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,616
and as its corollary with active

697
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,576
inference. Thank you. That's a key

698
00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:49,376
point, right? Because that's what we

699
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,236
look at. Your gotta this is the tough

700
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:54,992
word for me. And and you can actually

701
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:57,650
look at that even in the context of

702
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,724
businesses business strategy and so

703
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:03,556
forth, with some understanding of the

704
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,228
absorbing barriers. Right. When does a

705
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,924
business dissipate when it's not close

706
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:10,548
enough to its preferred state, like

707
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:12,200
adequate cash flow?

708
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,520
I think that just seems like a really

709
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,456
interesting progression from where the

710
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:21,364
state of the art of dynamic, nonlinear

711
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,704
dynamic systems is the way we model

712
00:36:23,822 --> 00:36:26,764
businesses now. Well, that's the way

713
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:28,236
some of us do it. A lot of people use a

714
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:31,836
spreadsheet, but this would

715
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:34,136
just seem like a potentially tremendous

716
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:36,476
advancement. Yeah. And then just a few

717
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:39,196
notes then, John, this Stephen Fox who's

718
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:41,644
also joined and talked about industrial

719
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:44,976
engineering, he's recently had this

720
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:46,224
paper come out just a couple of days

721
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:49,056
ago. And ironically, a spreadsheet is

722
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:51,252
provided in this paper, but this is also

723
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:53,236
in practice in several places in the

724
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:56,240
world in startup ecosystems,

725
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,356
and it's very academic influenced. And

726
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:00,592
then one other more conceptual note,

727
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:02,644
Cadcad, which is the complex systems

728
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,856
modeling software, and I know some of

729
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:07,656
you are involved in Cadcad learning as

730
00:37:07,678 --> 00:37:11,176
well. They describe it as a language for

731
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,940
encoding generalized dynamical systems.

732
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,916
And that is what it is. Active Block,

733
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:19,324
for instance, is our project where

734
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,652
Yaakob has done much of the initial work

735
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:24,716
that is implementing active inference in

736
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:27,504
Cadcad. And we have a whole litany of

737
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,756
questions about the relationships

738
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:31,404
between Bayes graphs, generalized

739
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:35,116
dynamical systems variational inference,

740
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,104
cadcad, which takes more of like a

741
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:39,508
sampling based approach versus the

742
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,976
variational approaches that we're

743
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,288
discussing here in Active. And it's

744
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:47,332
going to be very interesting as this

745
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,824
systems engineering, complex systems

746
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:52,808
simulation, as well as tokenomic and

747
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,576
other things becomes integrated with

748
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,896
this analytical framework, especially if

749
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,812
we can demonstrate a true concordance

750
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:03,210
between active inference and GDS. John

751
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,804
Lyle, I just wanted to say your comments

752
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,180
are really spot on. Earlier comments,

753
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,636
I think, if I can paraphrase, you had

754
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,796
essentially said maybe even a

755
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:17,036
dysfunctional society is performing

756
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:20,224
active inference. And then that would

757
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:24,124
lead us to really to the key components

758
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:26,032
then of that society or that social

759
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:29,016
system is what is its set of preferred

760
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,996
states and where is it placing its

761
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:34,916
attention? So if,

762
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:38,400
say, an elite group of very wealthy

763
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,404
people or powerful people are running

764
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:42,504
the world and they're running it for

765
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:44,724
their preferences, which is to maintain

766
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:48,104
their wealth and to ensure that

767
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:50,616
they stay on top, well, then the world,

768
00:38:50,718 --> 00:38:53,204
they could be performing functional,

769
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:58,910
active inference, and the world could

770
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,588
suffer the problems that that kind of

771
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,892
system would offer. On the other hand,

772
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:07,580
in a highly democratic system, if people

773
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,696
understand that they want clean air and

774
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:12,096
clean water and peace and all that kind

775
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:14,784
of stuff and then that's their set of

776
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,704
preferred states and their attention is

777
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:19,116
on that and they're performing active

778
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,000
inference.

779
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,140
Thank you, John Lyle. And then Mike.

780
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,816
So John, I'm completely on board with

781
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,616
that. I would just amplify a little bit

782
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,372
on that. I would say to a certain extent

783
00:39:36,436 --> 00:39:39,812
preferences and societal

784
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:42,840
decisions are emergent.

785
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,884
So you aren't going to find too many

786
00:39:45,922 --> 00:39:47,036
people in the world who are going to say

787
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:50,796
they want to be starving or have war or

788
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:55,324
whatever, right, and yet we do. So the

789
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:58,944
interesting thing is to me is

790
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,570
how does the individual,

791
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,656
I mean this is the whole build up,

792
00:40:04,678 --> 00:40:07,068
right? How does the individual behavior

793
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:10,340
somehow. Create.

794
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,764
An emergent system that has many bad

795
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:16,996
outcomes even though potentially none of

796
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:18,756
those are bad actors. Some of them are

797
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:20,950
bad actors. But let's just take the

798
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,364
simple case. There are no bad actors yet

799
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:26,136
we get bad outcome. Why is that? And we

800
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:29,572
can observe that in existing systems

801
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,530
and then we can ask the question, well

802
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,608
why is that? And then maybe if we

803
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,772
understand why that is, maybe we can do

804
00:40:35,826 --> 00:40:38,030
something to improve. Yes,

805
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,416
great point. And then just a short note,

806
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:44,696
there was in our remote teams we've

807
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:46,476
framed communication and information

808
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,556
architectures as organizational

809
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:51,696
affordances so that could assist with

810
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:53,376
decision making, find alignment where

811
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:54,812
people do have similar preferences,

812
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:56,816
like a zone of proximate agreement. In a

813
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,756
negotiation context it might be broader,

814
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:01,588
but no matter how broad it is, if you

815
00:41:01,594 --> 00:41:04,196
can't forage the path to it, it's going

816
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:08,324
to be a failing system. Mike yeah,

817
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:10,724
I just want to add, I think scaling or

818
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,848
the scale factor is hugely important

819
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:16,232
here. So if we're talking about

820
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:18,696
interactions amongst a handful of

821
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:20,024
individuals, we're going to see

822
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,616
different behaviors and outcomes than we

823
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:25,400
might see on a global scale of cultural

824
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,148
interaction. Okay, and then the

825
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,230
last comment on that john, go for it.

826
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,516
If your hand is still up I don't hear

827
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:38,416
you actually. Okay. Your microphone may

828
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,640
have changed or can other people hear?

829
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,840
John no. Okay.

830
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,024
Eric, go for it. Yeah.

831
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:49,096
How does this all apply to a highly

832
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:53,110
distributed system? I don't see that.

833
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,070
Yes, like a society is.

834
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,688
Good question. The multi agent case is

835
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,720
something that hasn't been studied

836
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,192
across the board. But. In 2021 with

837
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:12,664
colleagues. This is like one of the

838
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:15,400
early it's not the first multi agent

839
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,016
simulation because there were multi

840
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,036
agent simulations. However, it was the

841
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,224
first active inference model involving

842
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,580
stigma g, which is the feedback process

843
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,464
with agents modifying their environments

844
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:28,864
and so on. We can think about

845
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:32,252
even a Nested distributed cognitive

846
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:36,064
system as inheriting some sparsity from

847
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:38,224
a causal perspective. Like there's more

848
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:39,888
connections in the Bayes graph within

849
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,096
the Nest mate's head as we're modeling

850
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:44,068
it and then interactions induce like a

851
00:42:44,074 --> 00:42:46,084
sparsity between two brains and then

852
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:47,348
they're always coupled with the

853
00:42:47,354 --> 00:42:51,056
environment and so on. And that sparsity

854
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,280
is a statistical convenience, but also

855
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:58,970
it allows factorizability of models and

856
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,456
the models may be factorized in a way

857
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:06,348
where free energy calculations could be,

858
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:09,404
for example, summed within a level of

859
00:43:09,442 --> 00:43:12,156
collective behavior. I don't know if

860
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:14,236
that's going that's not the solution in

861
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,424
and of itself to the modeling. But when

862
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,756
we have systems of like Nested Markov

863
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:23,644
blankets, enclosing systems and closing

864
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:26,716
systems and then also lateral

865
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:28,672
interactions and interfaces like

866
00:43:28,726 --> 00:43:31,076
collective behavior, those systems are

867
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,652
at least amenable to this kind of

868
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:36,196
principled composition via their

869
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:39,264
sparsity, which does map onto a causal

870
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:40,948
architecture or at least a useful one of

871
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:44,456
the real world. So also remains to be

872
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:46,424
seen. But I think that's a very

873
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:47,610
important question.

874
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,776
Lyle yeah, Eric, I would

875
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:55,068
throw in on that question because

876
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:57,644
society of course, broadly speaking is

877
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:59,276
loosely coupled. However, of course

878
00:43:59,298 --> 00:44:00,936
there are clicks and densely coupled

879
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:04,668
areas that create the well

880
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:07,884
documented complex connection graphs,

881
00:44:07,932 --> 00:44:10,416
right? So that connection graph is

882
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:13,376
emergent, right? So the question is, I

883
00:44:13,398 --> 00:44:14,576
think this would be actually a really

884
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:16,864
fascinating research project. Can we

885
00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:20,304
show that FEP would generate connection

886
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:23,812
graphs or patterns of

887
00:44:23,866 --> 00:44:26,004
societal interactions similar to what

888
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,048
has been observed? Right, so there's

889
00:44:28,144 --> 00:44:30,932
lots and lots of research on what those

890
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:34,648
graphs look like. So is it possible for

891
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:39,880
us to or someone to use

892
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,412
FEP to show how those kind of connection

893
00:44:43,476 --> 00:44:46,808
patterns would emerge? I think that's

894
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:50,332
a really interesting question, yes. How

895
00:44:50,386 --> 00:44:54,152
we threshold and parameterize

896
00:44:54,216 --> 00:44:57,132
those causal graphs, how we evaluate

897
00:44:57,196 --> 00:45:00,336
counterfactuals on those graphs and

898
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:01,696
that's related to the problem of

899
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:04,272
structured learning. But Bayesian model

900
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,244
selection and other sort of hierarchical

901
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:10,208
Bayesian methods have the tools.

902
00:45:10,304 --> 00:45:13,764
There also just quick pointer to the

903
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:16,212
project ideas table there's some very

904
00:45:16,266 --> 00:45:19,332
interesting projects that people have

905
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:22,360
suggested. Jakub, no big deal,

906
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:26,168
sounds like a good one, but we can

907
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:28,984
absolutely do it. And that's one of the

908
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:32,836
advantages of being in an activity

909
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:35,724
driven, participatory research and

910
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:39,276
education space is we're hopefully going

911
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:41,672
to be able to help each other identify

912
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:43,404
those projects and where there has or

913
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:46,136
hasn't been overlap and then scaffold

914
00:45:46,168 --> 00:45:48,192
those projects, support them and then

915
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,756
provide them like a place to communicate

916
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,976
about the project. Playing into the

917
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:56,144
ontology active blockprints. All these

918
00:45:56,182 --> 00:45:58,988
pieces that one researcher working by

919
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:02,612
themselves would have just not

920
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:05,220
those affordances. Let's just try to

921
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,672
quickly look at the last several

922
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:07,350
questions.

923
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,604
Must all preferred states and strategies

924
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:14,744
be ultimately linked to survival in some

925
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,636
way? Or in the case of some organisms,

926
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:19,672
can free energy be related to something

927
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:23,400
other than survival? So just a

928
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,292
quick thought on that. In the context of

929
00:46:25,346 --> 00:46:28,350
repeated measurements yes,

930
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,496
survival is the capacity for repeated

931
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:34,680
measurements. Free energy energies

932
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,144
for domain specific models can

933
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:39,936
be made that have nothing to do with

934
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:42,604
survival. And I don't think that there's

935
00:46:42,652 --> 00:46:44,370
any contradiction there.

936
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,810
John,

937
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,930
I still don't hear you, actually.

938
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,626
Rohan and then anyone else who raises

939
00:47:00,658 --> 00:47:03,942
their hand. Yeah,

940
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:08,140
hi. So I was actually wondering because

941
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,274
there's no treatment of time in any of

942
00:47:11,312 --> 00:47:13,340
these methods, right?

943
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,026
Is there any accommodation made? So if

944
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:22,494
you're sampling something, let's say you

945
00:47:22,532 --> 00:47:25,066
sample at a minute frequency, you're

946
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:26,922
getting a certain set of events,

947
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,686
whereas if you're sampling at a much

948
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,942
higher frequency, you would get a very

949
00:47:30,996 --> 00:47:33,842
different, much more noisy data set.

950
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:35,934
But that might be essential to capture

951
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:38,370
certain things that might actually

952
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,562
enable survival. Maybe there's certain

953
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:43,380
events that act only at certain times.

954
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,590
So from the perspective of

955
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,342
repeated measurement right. So I think

956
00:47:50,396 --> 00:47:52,774
free energy principle, as it relates to

957
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:56,386
survival, could it just be related to

958
00:47:56,428 --> 00:48:00,250
some sort of creating an internal clock

959
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,738
for repeated measurement? Great

960
00:48:03,824 --> 00:48:07,366
question. Yes. So far it's

961
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:10,506
been almost time independent,

962
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:13,966
as you suggest. But we're going to be

963
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:17,054
dealing with two ways to deal with time

964
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:19,386
in chapter four and beyond. And that's

965
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:22,066
like a discrete time formalization where

966
00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:24,414
future and past states are explicitly

967
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:26,766
modeled, partially observable Markov

968
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:29,634
decision process. And then also a

969
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:32,386
continuous time variance where future

970
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:35,634
and past time points are not explicitly

971
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:38,226
modeled. However, a Taylor series

972
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:40,342
approximation, higher and higher

973
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:43,250
derivatives of a function are utilized

974
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,290
to glean an approximation to the future

975
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,954
behavior of a function. Those are two

976
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,538
different ways of dealing with time.

977
00:48:50,624 --> 00:48:52,634
And then you talked about, like,

978
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:56,460
sampling rate, and I think

979
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,506
you'll see many connections and ways to

980
00:49:00,528 --> 00:49:02,734
apply that. For example, you could

981
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:04,782
imagine, like, if the sensor is every

982
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,894
second, but you're able to think ten

983
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:09,566
times per second, or what about when the

984
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:11,738
sensor is every 10 seconds, but you're

985
00:49:11,754 --> 00:49:13,742
only able to think over this timescale.

986
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:16,114
And it's those kinds of situations where

987
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,018
actually the frequencies are happening

988
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:20,194
differently that we also might be able

989
00:49:20,232 --> 00:49:24,462
to address. Yes. Rohan yeah.

990
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:26,674
Also, like, if there are multiple

991
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:29,654
sensors, some of them react quickly,

992
00:49:29,772 --> 00:49:32,226
some of them react slowly, or if there's

993
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:35,922
just or if we look at active inferences,

994
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:39,062
some sort of model averaging phenomena.

995
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,254
Right. So you have a model that runs

996
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:43,722
really fast, that reacts really quickly

997
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:45,866
and produces predictions really quickly,

998
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:49,818
and the other one acts

999
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:53,482
more slowly. Would those be valid

1000
00:49:53,546 --> 00:49:56,880
targets in any sense?

1001
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,720
Yes, I think it's a very interesting

1002
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,066
question. I'll just add it here just

1003
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:05,406
because it was where we were discussing

1004
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:09,122
it, like about different timescales and

1005
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:12,386
the way that cognitive clock rates for

1006
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:14,358
example and sensory clock rates and then

1007
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:15,906
the timescale events, the statistical

1008
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:17,880
regularities in the world happen.

1009
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,506
In model stream 4.1 with DeVries

1010
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:25,846
and colleagues they talked about the

1011
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:28,700
message passing in a factor graph. So

1012
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,690
anytime that there's a bayes graph

1013
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,158
there's a way to accomplish variational

1014
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:37,082
inference on that base graph using

1015
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:40,126
message passing techniques. That's what

1016
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:42,814
their package is about for any lab.

1017
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:45,486
And then what they hinted at towards the

1018
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,422
end is actually this reactive message

1019
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:50,666
passing development which uses

1020
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:53,086
reactive programming techniques. So

1021
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:55,346
whereas in message passing, at least in

1022
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:58,206
the 40 factor graph formalization it's

1023
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:00,402
like you crank the model and a message

1024
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:02,126
is passed amongst every node or there's

1025
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:04,546
like a given execution order of messages

1026
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:06,626
that are passed for the entire graph.

1027
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:09,954
However, the reactive message passing

1028
00:51:10,002 --> 00:51:14,482
paradigm may allow like uncoupling

1029
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:17,686
of the frequency of message passing. So

1030
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,574
you might have one prior that gets one

1031
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:20,998
message per hour and then there's

1032
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:22,666
another distribution that gets one

1033
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,506
message per minute and another one is

1034
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:27,114
getting 1. Even that one could be doing

1035
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:28,394
model averaging of something much

1036
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:31,518
faster. So there's many ways that I

1037
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:33,038
think your questions will be starting to

1038
00:51:33,044 --> 00:51:41,422
be explored. Rohan and then John okay

1039
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:44,306
John, if. Your mic is can you hear me

1040
00:51:44,328 --> 00:51:47,506
now? Oh good. On the question of

1041
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:49,378
survival, I think you would have to

1042
00:51:49,464 --> 00:51:51,522
identify to answer it, you'd have to

1043
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:54,158
identify first what is the organism or

1044
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:55,542
what is the agent that you're talking

1045
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:58,182
about because obviously if it's an

1046
00:51:58,236 --> 00:52:00,886
individual person, a person might

1047
00:52:01,068 --> 00:52:03,720
sacrifice their life for others. So then

1048
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,900
survival is not necessarily the main

1049
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:14,060
driver but if it's a society then

1050
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,094
any individual might not survive but

1051
00:52:19,152 --> 00:52:21,566
society as a whole might. I suspect in

1052
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,702
the bigger picture that it's not

1053
00:52:24,756 --> 00:52:26,954
really survival of a species it's

1054
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:30,686
probably the ability to the

1055
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,782
propagation of information somehow.

1056
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:35,118
That's what I would guess in the biggest

1057
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:37,890
picture that's probably what everything

1058
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,020
is doing is propagating information.

1059
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,842
And Mike Levin has also explored how

1060
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:47,558
changes in the scope of the self can

1061
00:52:47,644 --> 00:52:50,114
lead to an organism with reduced fitness

1062
00:52:50,162 --> 00:52:52,674
as a function of a cancer with increased

1063
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:56,450
fitness and vision, so to speak. And so

1064
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,522
just because there's an imperative or

1065
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:01,350
normative way that we model behavior

1066
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,482
doesn't mean that everything works or

1067
00:53:03,536 --> 00:53:04,700
anything like that.

1068
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:11,598
Yes. Ali yes.

1069
00:53:11,684 --> 00:53:14,160
Adding to what John said well,

1070
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,322
yes, again, I believe here survival

1071
00:53:17,386 --> 00:53:20,362
doesn't necessarily mean biological

1072
00:53:20,426 --> 00:53:24,466
survival and actually it

1073
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:28,420
has a much broader sense and it means

1074
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,178
the existence of things. Actually it's a

1075
00:53:32,184 --> 00:53:36,534
metaphysical concept here because as

1076
00:53:36,572 --> 00:53:41,298
I said, Karl Friston has defined

1077
00:53:41,394 --> 00:53:47,994
the existence or the

1078
00:53:48,032 --> 00:53:51,740
prerequisite of existence as having two

1079
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,770
parameters or two features namely

1080
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,202
being an ergotic system and having

1081
00:53:58,256 --> 00:54:02,378
markup blankets. So any system which has

1082
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:04,574
these any system which has these two

1083
00:54:04,612 --> 00:54:07,550
properties can basically be considered

1084
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,854
as an existing system or we can call it

1085
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:14,020
a surviving system. Here,

1086
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,114
just in our last minutes before we go to

1087
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:21,506
tools touch on some of these points can

1088
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:22,978
markup blanket be considered a

1089
00:54:22,984 --> 00:54:25,538
decoupling mechanism? So can anything

1090
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,910
mathematical be considered a mechanism?

1091
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,318
People use terms in different ways. So

1092
00:54:31,324 --> 00:54:33,766
that just to raise the point that a

1093
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:35,218
linear aggression on height and weight

1094
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:37,026
isn't a mechanism of height and weight,

1095
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:39,218
it's just a descriptor. So Markov

1096
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,566
blanket doesn't need to be any kind of

1097
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:42,922
mechanism at all, it doesn't need to cut

1098
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:44,314
nature at the joints or anything like

1099
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:46,906
that. That being said, there are ways in

1100
00:54:46,928 --> 00:54:48,582
which one could think of the blanket

1101
00:54:48,646 --> 00:54:50,526
again variously depending on how the

1102
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:52,106
real generative model and generative

1103
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:55,658
process separated as part of a Markov

1104
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:58,718
partition. Sometimes there's ways to

1105
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:01,018
think of it as how they're coupled,

1106
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,534
other times it is a statistical

1107
00:55:03,582 --> 00:55:06,574
decoupling of a type, it's a partial

1108
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:08,658
information encapsulation, but it's not

1109
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:11,506
a total encapsulation and that way it is

1110
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:14,114
like an interface. And yes, thanks to

1111
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:17,766
whomever has added this quote this is

1112
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:20,038
one reason why the transcripts of all of

1113
00:55:20,044 --> 00:55:21,442
the live streams and discussions

1114
00:55:21,506 --> 00:55:24,358
augmented with the ontology will be so

1115
00:55:24,444 --> 00:55:26,778
helpful and searchable because we could

1116
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:28,586
find sentences that have raised similar

1117
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:31,258
points and address them. So, good

1118
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:34,700
question and then just the last ones,

1119
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,560
maybe we can come back to this.

1120
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:45,150
And then this one is a nice

1121
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,782
next step question thinking about

1122
00:55:48,836 --> 00:55:50,366
friction. What is the analogy to

1123
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:53,666
friction in a cognitive system? What is

1124
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:56,482
the stochastic fluctuation on our

1125
00:55:56,536 --> 00:55:58,850
cognitive path of least action?

1126
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,846
What is that in the real world realism

1127
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:06,166
ontological claims? And then from the

1128
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:08,742
behavioral modeling perspective, where

1129
00:56:08,796 --> 00:56:11,880
are we using these equations and

1130
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,326
partitioning variance into a path or

1131
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:19,878
a flow of least action and a variable

1132
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:23,062
that is analogous to stochastic

1133
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:26,154
fluctuation or friction but doesn't take

1134
00:56:26,192 --> 00:56:28,634
on any of the baggage of describing some

1135
00:56:28,672 --> 00:56:31,646
feature or component or mechanism of the

1136
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:34,462
physical system. So also a great

1137
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,046
question though and we'll leave this one

1138
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:37,646
in case people want to continue to

1139
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:41,166
address it. So that brings us to the

1140
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:44,210
end of chapter three live meetings.

1141
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,786
Next week, we'll head into two weeks of

1142
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:49,486
chapter four, then two weeks of chapter

1143
00:56:49,518 --> 00:56:51,874
five, and then we'll have two weeks to

1144
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:53,842
sort of ground ourselves, think about

1145
00:56:53,896 --> 00:56:56,038
what we've learned, talk about project

1146
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:59,190
ideas, and then we'll be heading into

1147
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,406
the second cohort of the first half of

1148
00:57:02,428 --> 00:57:05,014
the book. And for those who are here who

1149
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:08,794
want to continue into the back nine,

1150
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:11,706
as it were, the second half of the

1151
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,646
textbook. And also people are welcomed

1152
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:16,682
and encouraged to be facilitators or

1153
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,558
return participants in the second cohort

1154
00:57:19,654 --> 00:57:22,126
first part because it's many coats of

1155
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:24,558
paint for everyone. And so we want to

1156
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:26,254
provide that affordance to return again

1157
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,442
and again. And again because the basics

1158
00:57:28,506 --> 00:57:31,022
are the classics and the essence and the

1159
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:32,946
seed of innovation. All this other

1160
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:34,674
important things that happen when we

1161
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:38,242
return and clarify. Also we've had to

1162
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:41,186
sort of do all of these entering of

1163
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,378
figures and equations for the first time

1164
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,746
but now that we have the architecture.

1165
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:48,342
People can focus on annotating them, or

1166
00:57:48,396 --> 00:57:50,518
they can focus on adding new questions

1167
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:52,262
or improving the questions that others

1168
00:57:52,316 --> 00:57:53,350
have written.

1169
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,810
If anyone else has any comments that

1170
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,426
they want to make while the recording is

1171
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,866
still occurring, I'll just give a few

1172
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:03,820
seconds for anyone to raise their hand

1173
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:08,970
and then we'll end this session and then

1174
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,134
take a 1 minute break. And then in this

1175
00:58:11,172 --> 00:58:14,010
room, we'll be continuing on with tools,

1176
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,246
organizational unit. And if you want

1177
00:58:17,268 --> 00:58:18,974
to continue speaking with people here

1178
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:21,166
about just any topic at all, you can

1179
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:23,166
head up to a room up top and then of

1180
00:58:23,188 --> 00:58:24,786
course always you can join into the

1181
00:58:24,808 --> 00:58:27,314
discord voice channels and just be

1182
00:58:27,352 --> 00:58:29,166
working on things like during the math

1183
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:31,614
reading group or any other area rojan

1184
00:58:31,662 --> 00:58:32,866
and then anyone else who raises their

1185
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:33,460
hand.

1186
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:39,534
Yeah, actually, sorry for this late

1187
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,310
part. I'm just curious,

1188
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,810
when you say the free energy principle,

1189
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,402
it's basically figuring out some set

1190
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:51,866
point of states, internal states that

1191
00:58:52,048 --> 00:58:54,646
the agent wants to be with, right? It's

1192
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:58,074
not necessary that it

1193
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:00,046
actually couples to the real world. So

1194
00:59:00,148 --> 00:59:03,294
why wouldn't it be that? Okay, it just

1195
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,246
becomes a brain in the VAT type of

1196
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:06,000
situation.

1197
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:12,190
It just needs to find a set point that

1198
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,646
helps it survive. So it doesn't

1199
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:17,602
have to actually model the real world,

1200
00:59:17,656 --> 00:59:20,226
it just has to find a place and no

1201
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:21,938
matter what happens, just stay there.

1202
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:25,046
So it's not really dynamic. That could

1203
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:28,070
be that possibility.

1204
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,794
It is dynamic. It is explicitly modeling

1205
00:59:31,842 --> 00:59:34,006
time. And one can make a model just like

1206
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,054
a linear regression could be static, or

1207
00:59:36,092 --> 00:59:38,354
you could use the linear regression

1208
00:59:38,402 --> 00:59:41,754
technique and use it in I was more

1209
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,586
referring it. So if you look at some of

1210
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:46,246
the reinforcement, deep reinforcement

1211
00:59:46,278 --> 00:59:47,898
learning models, right? They usually

1212
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,946
find some trick within the game. Like if

1213
00:59:49,968 --> 00:59:51,886
you're looking at Atari games and you

1214
00:59:51,908 --> 00:59:54,846
say maximize the score, for example, so

1215
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:58,266
it tries to find, okay, I can maximize

1216
00:59:58,298 --> 00:59:59,854
the score by doing the simplest thing

1217
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:02,306
that doesn't require me to progress in

1218
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:04,978
any way, but it would increase the

1219
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:09,682
score. Okay? So yes,

1220
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,234
these are important things, so write

1221
01:00:11,272 --> 01:00:13,406
them down so that we can have infinite

1222
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:16,766
discourse on them. The brain,

1223
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:18,786
the VAT does still have an interface

1224
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,146
with the environment, whether it's

1225
01:00:20,178 --> 01:00:22,646
receive only and then you brought up

1226
01:00:22,668 --> 01:00:24,018
like it doesn't have to be like modeling

1227
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,386
the quote real world. This is the

1228
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:30,010
architecture that helps us bypass that

1229
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,842
and say, right, the particulate states,

1230
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:35,386
the particular states, which are the

1231
01:00:35,408 --> 01:00:37,514
blanket states and the internal states

1232
01:00:37,712 --> 01:00:39,726
are doing inference, acting as if

1233
01:00:39,748 --> 01:00:41,466
they're doing inference on external

1234
01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:43,946
states. So it's perfectly compatible

1235
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:46,234
with scientific realism, scientific

1236
01:00:46,282 --> 01:00:48,990
surrealism, aesthetic surrealism.

1237
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,190
It could be hallucinating the world,

1238
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,506
and it's actually just doing inference

1239
01:00:58,538 --> 01:01:01,150
on the hallucination rather than actual

1240
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,214
reality as such. Anil Seth and many

1241
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:06,806
others who speak of that reality as a

1242
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:09,798
controlled hallucination, they're 2ft in

1243
01:01:09,804 --> 01:01:13,254
that territory without any qualms and

1244
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:14,678
feeling like it addresses questions that

1245
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:15,734
have been unaddressed by other

1246
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,630
perspectives.

1247
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,038
Okay, so I'll just put this there.

1248
01:01:22,204 --> 01:01:23,446
Cool. Thank you,
