1690	2574	1	A	0.99987	Hello, everyone.
2692	10990	2	A	1.0	It is June 16, 2022, and it's meeting seven of the active textbook textbook group Cohort one.
11140	18366	3	A	0.55803	We're in our second discussion of chapter three today.
18468	25150	4	A	0.92268	We'll be looking at the questions that haven't been addressed, so the ones without thumbs.
25770	31320	5	A	1.0	And also, it's not too late to add more questions or to upvote questions.
32170	58720	6	A	0.75	And then additionally, since the Math Learning Group has been quite active in providing synchronous affordances for conversation around some of the background on the Math as well as some aspects of the equations that we'll go through today and also even to applications of the math and developing notebooks and such.
59730	67300	7	A	0.64001	We'll take a look at the math in our move through chapter three.
68150	77720	8	A	0.89433	Before we go to the questions, does anyone have anything that they just want to remark on chapter three, Ali and then anyone else?
80650	81350	9	B	0.96632	Yeah.
81500	99674	10	B	1.0	Well, last week I talked about how I changed my mind about these bottom up and top down characterizations of low road and high road, respectively, after reading chapter three, but it turns out that they are, in fact, bottom up and top down approaches after all.
99792	116450	11	B	0.68	You see, I came across this, in my opinion, undeservedly lesser known piece of beautiful, beautiful writing by Karl Frisden which explicitly argues for such characterizations and the philosophical importance of this distinction.
116790	126146	12	B	0.77492	It's called beyond the Desert Landscape, and it's inconspicuously hidden in this book, Andy Clark and his critics.
126338	132870	13	B	1.0	So I'd like to quote a couple of sentences from this writing.
133530	146662	14	B	1.0	Well, he writes quote the high road stands in for a top down approach that starts by asking fundamental questions about the necessary properties things must possess if they exist.
146806	161834	15	B	0.99999	Using mathematical variational principles, one can then show that existence is an embodied exchange of a creature with its environment that necessarily entails predictive processing as one aspect of a self evidencing mechanics.
161962	163854	16	B	0.77	The low road is the purpose.
163982	183170	17	B	0.9	The agenda established is to pursue the agenda established by Kant and Hellholtz and generalize in a bottom up way, the capacity for inference and prediction to see how far it takes us in understanding embodied exchange with the environment.
183330	196300	18	B	1.0	So if anyone likes to gain a deeper understanding about these conceptual characterizations, I highly, highly recommend this chapter of this book.
196990	205754	19	B	1.0	And quite unusually for Frison writing, it also lacks any mathematical formalism.
205882	209440	20	B	1.0	It doesn't include a single mathematical equation there.
211090	212080	21	A	0.99996	Thank you.
212870	213378	22	A	0.72342	Yeah.
213464	217118	23	A	1.0	In a recent stream, we also talked about the desert landscape.
217134	237110	24	A	0.84	And Clark's concern was that we might do away with what populates are implicitly assumed to be rich ecosystems of psychology, philosophy and so on, with important ecosystem players like goals.
238110	245078	25	A	1.0	And so the fear or concern was that we might be in a quineyan desert landscape.
245174	259594	26	A	0.64386	If we replace some of these, again, implicitly or explicitly stated, to be rich constructs like goals, and we're like, well, it's just distribution matching, then we've made some sort of like a desert monoculture.
259722	267570	27	A	1.0	And that would be depoprant of what does Clark say to his desert living critics?
269510	274082	28	A	0.98	All right, if anyone else has a thought, they can raise their hand.
274136	276520	29	A	0.95925	Otherwise we can look at the questions.
277610	290810	30	A	0.99	Okay, so this first question if one defines preferred states as expected states, one can say living organisms must minimize the surprise of their sensory observations.
291470	294202	31	A	0.95607	I'm not clear on the ontology here.
294336	299858	32	A	1.0	Is it that preference is the same as expectation or that formally we can use them in the same equation?
300054	302270	33	A	1.0	Is that an ontological claim?
302850	309680	34	A	1.0	And is the free Energy and physics an analogy or an ontological assertion about how things really are?
311090	318242	35	A	1.0	So one starting place was I found the slide and so wanted to highlight it.
318296	323026	36	A	0.99961	This was in Free Energy, a user's guide which was live.
323048	324340	37	A	0.99722	Stream number 37.
326810	329190	38	A	0.96	The slides will be probably a little bigger.
332250	338410	39	A	0.92442	It's worth restating just how unusual it is to interpret P as a measure of both probabilities and preferences.
339390	347610	40	A	0.99999	They both start with P, though there's nothing wrong with treating a distribution as a measure of preferences because distributions can have different interpretations.
348030	357710	41	A	0.99954	But what's unorthodox and in need of justification is giving the same mathematical term two different interpretations within the same equation.
359730	383190	42	A	0.94145	They then add some more details that unpack a little bit about how it is the case that the same term, P can be utilized as both a probability and a preference.
383930	404590	43	A	1.0	And then they even extended it into a third P, the, the PH fitness, where by allowing your probabilities and your preferences to converge to reduce the divergence between those two distributions, then fitness is achieved.
407010	421380	44	A	0.55	And so they provided a restatement of the way that that is implemented and then highlighted in additional grounding or interpretive line.
425370	431320	45	A	1.0	So that's at least one part of that question.
437010	440290	46	A	1.0	And also to look towards the equations.
440630	451970	47	A	0.7368	It's something that we'll be able to have very clear answers for and thanks to the work of Ali and Blue and others who have been annotating equations.
452890	463270	48	A	1.0	So for example, in equation 3.1, or we can look at like box one, equation one, which is like a Markov blanket definition.
465550	485034	49	A	1.0	In the description field we have a natural language description and then the terms that are used in the description are those that are referenced using variables.
485162	510120	50	A	1.0	So that will help us translate across natural language of different human languages, the discrete and continuous time formalisms which we're going to explore in this textbook, also identical or isomorphic or related formalisms in other papers which sometimes are using the same notation letters, but not always.
510810	521350	51	A	0.819	But we could have another column for first in 2019 and here's first in 2013 and then there's a conversation to be had about where they align or don't.
521430	535390	52	A	1.0	And that's the kind of annotation work that somebody can engage in from the publications and that also helps us connect it to the programmatic implementations like in Active Block, for instance, or in other scripts.
535810	550750	53	A	1.0	So that even that we can promote norms and practices around variable naming in math and in programming, but also where there is divergences or differences which are important for innovating and evolving the norms.
550910	562630	54	A	1.0	We can also map them pretty coherently so all the equations for three can be read naturally.
563050	577760	55	A	1.0	So we discussed this a lot in the math group and again, a lot of people contributed to this with one of the goals or functions being that whenever we are going to bring up an equation, like if there's a question about equation 3.1.
578530	586910	56	A	0.99999	We can just briefly read the current state of the description.
587250	598290	57	A	0.99999	Because whether you're super familiar with the letters and variables and how they're concatenated, or whether it's just like a first pass on your seeing this equation.
599430	608920	58	A	0.50428	Everybody will benefit when we align our regime of attention to actually what it says, and then that will help us do many, many other things.
612620	625100	59	A	0.99991	But to return back to this question, does anyone want to raise their hand and give a thought on the relationship between preference and expectation?
626960	650960	60	A	0.73499	Ontological claims about preference and its relationship with expectation and more generally, is the free energy something that is an analogy or mathematical isomorphism or an equation that rhymes or is it also an assertion?
652180	655960	61	C	0.44	It it's an equation that rhymes.
657900	659464	62	A	0.99943	What makes you say that?
659662	665450	63	C	0.59394	No, just because it's cute, that's all.
669120	670792	64	C	0.99	I just joined the conversation.
670856	678370	65	C	0.70011	But preference and expectation, I wouldn't think they were at all referring to the same thing.
681060	684000	66	C	0.99952	Expectation is a mathematical operator.
685460	691300	67	C	0.98743	Preference is a statement.
693160	693910	68	A	1.0	Yes.
695560	697910	69	A	0.65171	Expectation is used in multiple ways.
698920	711800	70	A	0.97	It can refer to predictions about the mean or the mode or other attributes of a future time point like I'm expecting, what are you expecting to happen on next Monday?
712700	730080	71	A	0.99984	Also, expectation can refer and that's how it's used with the fancy e to refer to the expected value of a distribution which for a gaussian is the mode in the center of a symmetric peak.
730820	739852	72	A	1.0	And that doesn't need to be about a future time point, that can just be the expectation of the height of the classroom.
739916	750500	73	A	0.93068	Right now it's not saying that's what we're expecting it to be in a year as it might be used conversationally but it's referring to just like the average of a distribution.
753560	754310	74	C	0.87723	Right?
754700	758264	75	C	0.74121	Mathematically it's an operator and verbally it.
758302	759050	76	B	0.99982	Can be.
760780	764010	77	C	0.99	A prediction or a desire or something.
765120	765870	78	A	1.0	Yes.
766720	790736	79	A	0.9	And then again in 37 and elsewhere it'll be worth returning to this again and again because it's one of the essential architectural decisions in active inference that enable it's part of the necessity and sufficiency complex.
790848	805204	80	A	0.63	I don't know whether this is the whole meat of it, but it's part of what allows the dispensal of an explicit reward term, like a homeostatic reinforcement.
805252	811640	81	A	0.9998	Reward driven learner would be like, I'm more rewarded by being in my homeostatic range.
811980	814648	82	A	1.0	And then there needs to be this architecture around.
814734	816780	83	A	0.93	Well, how are we going to pursue reward?
818480	830240	84	A	0.99584	Alternatively, an organism trying to maintain homeostasis realism or us modeling an organism that is maintaining homeostasis instrumentalism.
830900	836716	85	A	0.99997	We can just say it expects to be in the range.
836748	839920	86	A	1.0	That conversationally we're going to describe as a preference.
840740	841568	87	A	0.90197	How do we know?
841654	846150	88	A	0.99999	We put the animal in the room and it's spending a lot of its time on this warmer side.
847160	849030	89	A	1.0	It prefers to be there.
849480	851652	90	A	1.0	We also expect it to be there.
851786	854090	91	A	0.99435	We're less surprised when we see it there.
855020	874172	92	A	1.0	So then it's possible to as they right here interpret that p location distribution in the room for the animal that we're observing or the temperature distribution for the body in the homeostatic context as being a probability density over.
874226	890960	93	A	0.52962	Temperatures over locations as well as reflecting the preferences, not the qualia or the phenomenology or anything like too far out about what it means to prefer where preferences arise from, whether they're fixed or learned in the model.
891030	894500	94	A	1.0	All these many, many trails that can come out of that.
894650	906520	95	A	0.99978	But just at this essential layer, we don't need to interpolate a reward term between what is expected and what is preferred.
913240	915348	96	A	0.99474	Any other comments from someone?
915434	917290	97	A	1.0	Yes, Eric, and then anyone else?
919980	931004	98	D	0.93381	Yeah, just to remark on that, it seems you're still not removing the free variable of what the preference of the agent organism is.
931202	932236	99	D	0.92357	You're just holding it.
932258	937420	100	D	0.91333	You're putting it in a different place so that you can use it in this unified equation.
937760	942860	101	D	0.99997	But you still have this it's a free variable.
943200	944224	102	D	0.85061	What do you want to do?
944262	945644	103	D	1.0	Okay, I'm going to call that an expectation.
945692	952130	104	D	1.0	And that's what I'm going to try to drive for when I optimize my variational, free energy.
952900	957232	105	D	0.99951	But in that sense, it's kind of a convenience or it's a trick.
957296	959140	106	D	0.9969	It's a little bit of an unnatural act.
959210	962900	107	D	0.55	I don't know the way I think of it, for a purpose.
966540	970810	108	D	0.48269	But you haven't solved any other problem.
971420	977800	109	D	0.92	The deeper problem of what should the organism attempt to achieve the goals.
981680	982380	110	A	1.0	Yes.
982530	983900	111	A	0.99971	Thanks, Ali.
988720	999168	112	B	1.0	Well, I think it also might be quite helpful to refer back to chapter two on page 36, I think.
999254	1011476	113	B	0.77825	Yeah, page 36 here they have actually distinguished between the term prediction and exactly.
1011578	1012084	114	B	0.99	Yes.
1012202	1020730	115	B	0.99351	Here the term prediction and expectation quite explicitly in terms of equation 2.6.
1023740	1024584	116	A	0.93	Okay.
1024782	1027290	117	A	1.0	So let's look at equation 2.6.
1030140	1030744	118	A	0.79	Okay.
1030862	1040732	119	A	0.83	A few of them, we don't have the third line fully described, but just here's the third line.
1040866	1045180	120	A	0.99993	What does this speak to with respect to preferences and expectations?
1049940	1057840	121	B	0.98081	Here the preference actually is in the second term, the Kullback Leibler divergence.
1057920	1058212	122	A	0.99975	Here.
1058266	1058870	123	B	0.93807	Yeah.
1061400	1065360	124	B	0.87402	It's actually inherent in the second term.
1065440	1071604	125	B	1.0	And the expectation, expected ambiguity, as it speaks for itself is the first term.
1071652	1081084	126	B	0.81	So we have here the risk is defined as the divergence between the preference and the states.
1081202	1087950	127	B	1.0	So I think that we can see the preference in this equation as well.
1090320	1101010	128	A	1.0	One note here is like that this G is equal to the first, the second, and this line.
1101460	1108868	129	A	0.58053	But one way that we can understand the relationship of the second and the third line is like they're very similar.
1108954	1112740	130	A	0.64	The first term is identical here.
1112890	1117350	131	A	1.0	The only difference is that instead of a Y, we see an X.
1118140	1122760	132	A	1.0	And so this is like X being the hidden state and Y being the observation.
1125660	1135260	133	A	1.0	In the case where it's a fully observable Markov process, then the outcomes and the hidden states are going to be like equal uncertainty about them.
1135410	1141336	134	A	0.99986	Because in that case it's functionally that the hidden states are observables.
1141528	1155520	135	A	1.0	However, if there's any amount of ambiguity like the a matrix between the hidden state and the observable, then there's always going to be more uncertainty about the hidden state relative to the observable.
1156200	1165780	136	A	1.0	And then importantly, on both sides there's a conditioning vertical line on policy selection.
1166680	1178760	137	A	0.71	And so that is what prevents us from getting into the like, well, what if it's 95% correct or 96 or 97% correct or any of these sort of like model diminishing returns debates.
1179100	1189768	138	A	0.71008	It's a functional that's calculated for each policy that have been possible of composing given the affordances.
1189864	1191976	139	A	0.96	A policy is just a sequence of actions.
1192088	1221496	140	A	1.0	So if there's four movement affordances, there's four policies of time depth one, there's 16 policies of time depth two, and so on and for whatever in this discrete, formalism, finite set of policies, there are they're evaluated here and then there's a policy selection that could choose the lowest expected free energy, or it could proportionally choose from them with different kinds of weighting and so on.
1221598	1230596	141	A	1.0	But this is comparing the relative expected ambiguity and risk conditioned upon different specific policies.
1230788	1242620	142	A	1.0	And there's a process by which those specific policies can be enumerated and then this is a process by which they're going to be evaluated and then there's a policy selection by which they're selected.
1243060	1249280	143	A	1.0	So organisms that fail to do this adequately enough will be dissipated.
1249620	1265140	144	A	0.57091	Or systems, whether it's just a molecular system or some other kind of statistical system that fail to do this well enough to remain being that kind of thing, are not amenable to repeated measurements.
1265560	1267204	145	A	0.99999	They are not that thing.
1267322	1276970	146	A	0.99999	But things that remain being that thing for the time horizon of observations will be selecting policies that are consistent with this.
1279660	1281164	147	A	0.99982	Can I ask a question about this?
1281282	1286430	148	D	0.98948	Yeah, about this equation here, say like the second line.
1289600	1310140	149	D	0.51	So first of all, see the preferences is not really spelled out very much in this chapter and I don't know where it will be, but I would have expected something more like preferences given observations like the observations, what's happened in the world that we can measure that's observation.
1310220	1310850	150	D	0.54154	Why?
1313240	1315280	151	D	0.91	And then how does that fit with my preferences?
1315360	1323476	152	D	1.0	So what I want to optimize is my preference, the achievement of my preferences as delivered by the observations.
1323668	1334584	153	D	1.0	Now, I understand that in that second equation you're going to do a divergence between observations, the Y tilde.
1334712	1338828	154	D	1.0	So you can't flip around p of C given y tilde there.
1338994	1343024	155	D	0.59	So can somebody explain to me how this all fits together then?
1343062	1346560	156	D	0.99999	How do you achieve preferences under that equation?
1348660	1361780	157	A	0.57439	I'll give one thought and I absolutely agree to the first point, which is like c is just like I don't even know if it's described in this chapter.
1363800	1365590	158	B	0.91	34, I think.
1366680	1370890	159	A	0.76	34, let me check it again.
1372860	1377748	160	A	0.8	I mean there is he said parameter.
1377844	1380688	161	D	0.98258	Includes preferences but it includes parameter.
1380804	1381276	162	B	0.98186	Yeah.
1381378	1398370	163	B	0.62	And also if you go to section 7.4 I think yes, in that section it is untangled why these two parameters are related and how these two parameters are related to each other.
1405220	1412336	164	A	0.94054	That's like multiple scales of where the information is not provided before when it needs to be provided.
1412528	1430020	165	A	0.99811	Which is like this I have made as just a helpful diagram of the partially observable Markov decision process which is C is the preferences and it influences how G evaluates policies which are generated from affordances over a given time horizon.
1430180	1435944	166	A	0.99991	Policies intervene upon how hidden states change in the world and there's more in different readings.
1435992	1452960	167	A	0.99991	But to return to Eric's question and then again, anyone with the raised hand so the question was whether we're comparing outcomes or states, how does this second term help us realize our preference?
1454660	1457184	168	A	1.0	Well, when is the KL?
1457312	1461344	169	A	0.9843	We're trying to minimize g of pi better policies have a lower score.
1461392	1466916	170	A	0.99988	It's like golf, I guess, or you could add negatives and make it higher.
1467098	1479604	171	A	1.0	And also just it's an interesting note like climbing Mount Improbable, biologists often think about the fitness peak and climbing to fitness peaks, whereas for a physicist it's often framed.
1479652	1492804	172	A	0.95	And also like computer science gradient descending and local minima, global minima, but they're just actually like the same landscape with some negative signs.
1492952	1503680	173	A	1.0	So the KL divergence and here we're trying to minimize if it's zero that would mean like we are perfectly realizing our preference.
1504500	1513760	174	A	1.0	So let's just say that there's two policies that we're comparing between and one of them is going to perfectly realize our preferences, the other one isn't.
1513840	1526330	175	A	0.97	So we have like pi one and pi two and we're going to be calculating the KL divergence of the outcomes that we're expecting under the variational distribution Q under policy one and under policy two.
1527260	1540830	176	A	1.0	So if policy one is going to perfectly realize if the outcomes of policy one are expected to perfectly realize our preferences, this term will be zero.
1542160	1554130	177	A	0.92627	Whereas if policy two is going to be expected to result in an outcome distribution that's not aligned with our preferences, it doesn't get penalized here.
1555060	1558084	178	A	1.0	This is just evaluated as a value.
1558282	1566144	179	A	0.99998	Nor does it get penalized here because in this case of fixed preferences that's also not changing as we iterate through policies.
1566272	1569124	180	A	0.72277	However, there would be a divergence that would be nonzero.
1569172	1575112	181	A	1.0	Like all divergences are between the inferior policy and the superior policy.
1575246	1583692	182	A	0.54	So by iterating over the finite set of policies that we have taking this term and just leaving it to the side.
1583746	1585896	183	A	0.99999	For now, only the KL divergence.
1586088	1596460	184	A	0.99992	This will lead us to select policies that can be expected to bring alignment between the observations conditioned on policy and our preferences.
1596620	1598320	185	A	0.99955	Preferred outcome distribution.
1599940	1601436	186	D	0.99996	Thank you, that's very helpful.
1601548	1608820	187	D	1.0	So just to kind of say that slightly differently is given your preferences, that's going to imply some outcomes.
1609480	1614980	188	D	1.0	And what you're trying to do with that KL divergence is you're trying to get the policy that will achieve those outcomes.
1620300	1647760	189	A	0.99	So if we expect and prefer to be within the homeostatic thermal range and then the two policies in the snowstorm are add the jacket or remove the jacket, which one of those are expected to have the minimum divergence between us being in the homeostatic range and then the policy conditioned expected outcomes?
1648340	1649884	190	A	0.98746	I'm going to have less divergence.
1649932	1651216	191	A	1.0	It doesn't even mean you're going to live.
1651318	1666900	192	A	1.0	It just means I'm going to have less divergence by having the jacket on in the snowstorm than by taking it off, which is going to move the expected outcome distribution further from the preference distribution, which here is fixed, but doesn't have to be fixed.
1673020	1689340	193	A	0.99	Okay, so we have several is anyone here the person who has written any of these questions?
1689410	1691150	194	A	0.91	And then we can just go to that one.
1694960	1695900	195	A	0.95546	Lyle?
1699700	1700450	196	B	0.66	Yes.
1700980	1702096	197	E	0.99952	There we go.
1702278	1703552	198	E	0.86	I think I'm on here.
1703686	1723080	199	E	0.99	Okay, so yeah, I wrote the one that is referring to the living organisms and the question about to what extent are these techniques valuable in what I would call social systems of wide ranging sorts.
1723580	1738860	200	E	1.0	And I know that this book at the outset limits itself to biological systems, at least that's my recollection from the introduction, but it just seems obvious to me that this would have much broader applicability.
1739440	1743790	201	E	0.98026	I'm curious what the state of that is.
1745520	1751836	202	A	1.0	Well, do I hesitate to put anyone on the spot?
1751948	1756720	203	A	0.9996	John, would you give a first response there while I add some resources?
1757380	1773988	204	C	0.99861	Yeah, my first thought on that is obviously our civilization is struggling and civilizations have failed in the past who collapsed.
1774164	1785992	205	C	1.0	So it's not necessarily the case that every social structure or societal structure is actually performing functional active inference.
1786136	1805840	206	C	0.61363	But if we were a highly functional organism, if societies were a highly functional organism, we would be doing something like active inference and learning from our mistakes and making sure that we put ourselves in an environment that is sustainable and all that kind of stuff.
1805990	1821060	207	C	0.94	So my first thought is, I think that all of this is applicable to societal systems, but it doesn't necessarily mean that any existing societal systems actually perform functional active inference.
1822300	1823752	208	A	0.99402	Yeah, thanks.
1823806	1830440	209	A	0.99846	It's almost like saying, hey, we're studying the penguins and their thermostats and homeostats.
1831180	1839032	210	A	0.99966	This model could be parameterized to fit a thriving or a failing society along various different dimensions.
1839176	1846356	211	A	0.82	And so in the sense that this is like a linear aggression that can capture failing as well as succeeding societies.
1846488	1853756	212	A	0.97	Yes, the Nested Markov blanket formalism has qualitatively, but increasingly quantitatively been applied.
1853788	1859368	213	A	0.6	And there's multiple startups and applications that are explicitly pursuing this angle.
1859484	1871692	214	A	0.6453	It's been brought up for several years now and in 2020 several of us wrote about it being applied to remote teams and organizations and communities.
1871776	1876644	215	A	1.0	I can add these links to decentralized science as a system and ecosystem.
1876772	1884410	216	A	0.75	So yes, people have started to sketch that continent out and there's a lot more to understand.
1885100	1886620	217	A	0.99999	What do you think, Lyle?
1887360	1890300	218	E	0.99675	Yeah, I think that makes a ton of sense.
1890370	1902064	219	E	0.55	I think obviously, I guess the way I was thinking about the question is not so much whether to what extent social systems do this because social systems so you could take two points of view.
1902102	1910900	220	E	1.0	One is you could say social systems are behaving cognitively in the ways that we're discussing.
1911320	1918064	221	E	0.56	In other words, there are preferred states that are driving behavior.
1918192	1923880	222	E	1.0	Now, we could say those preferred states are the wrong states for whatever reasons.
1925980	1943736	223	E	0.67	So there's a question between what we actually in any particular social system was actually happening, which I would argue could be described through this technique, or what they should be doing, which we could also describe through this technique.
1943848	1944316	224	E	0.53563	Right?
1944418	1948044	225	E	0.64	So I think it's important to have that distinction.
1948092	1959560	226	E	1.0	And there's a really long history of using dynamic systems models to explore those questions, especially in the business context.
1959660	1964160	227	E	0.65555	That's mostly how I made my living through the decades.
1964320	1973156	228	E	0.77	So that sort of as is to be or would prefer to be sort of questioned.
1973188	1987692	229	E	1.0	It just seems like this technique would potentially be a significant advance over the tools in that space that currently exists, which are primarily things like system dynamics and agent based modeling, stuff like that.
1987826	1997230	230	E	0.82459	But this would seem to have the potential to look at things as they are, why is it broken and what we might do.
1997940	2001660	231	A	1.0	Yes, so I have added several other references.
2001740	2002576	232	A	0.55783	It's important.
2002678	2025156	233	A	0.94	And the book, again, is like, if it's describing the linear model, then there's the applications of the linear model and as people and as John brought up, like many times in this series of live streams that we did, together with four with just the two of us, with John leading through basically the entire thread of this discussion of three papers and then two more group discussions.
2025348	2047048	234	A	0.60537	There's been recent work on scripts by Mahault and colleagues with a strong and a weak script formalization, like a strong script being when the norms are practiced, like in a ritualistic way, like reading from a script, versus the looser script concept, which could include just norms and social practice.
2047224	2053680	235	A	1.0	And then more recently they're modeling work using Pi MDP to talk about epistemic communities.
2054260	2063460	236	A	1.0	And then some of the very earliest live streams that we did were on narrative, human communication, cultural affordances.
2063960	2075610	237	A	1.0	So these are absolutely topics that have been addressed, although many of the earlier works are like here's people in the world, we're going to use active inference to model it.
2076460	2080856	238	A	0.99997	But then there's so much more beyond that.
2080958	2084744	239	A	0.7528	It's almost like a 1950s cybernetics book.
2084942	2093820	240	A	0.6	Well, we can just imagine that the person is going to be involved in this feedback loop, but then that's not the end of the discussion on that.
2093970	2095470	241	A	0.99197	Ali and then, John.
2098500	2126250	242	B	0.73	I just wanted to mention that, well, FEP can potentially be applied to any dynamical system with Ergodicity, because you see, any system with Ergotic behavior have some points of attraction, some attractors that all the other states are converging to.
2126620	2129064	243	B	0.59	So it's pretty general.
2129182	2145580	244	B	1.0	And well, almost all dynamical systems we know of on different timescales can be potentially modeled with FEP and as its corollary with active inference.
2146480	2147004	245	A	0.42877	Thank you.
2147042	2148192	246	E	0.99828	That's a key point, right?
2148246	2150176	247	E	0.99997	Because that's what we look at.
2150358	2153344	248	E	0.88	Your gotta this is the tough word for me.
2153542	2164640	249	E	0.53	And and you can actually look at that even in the context of businesses business strategy and so forth, with some understanding of the absorbing barriers.
2164720	2165444	250	A	0.87664	Right.
2165642	2172200	251	E	0.99672	When does a business dissipate when it's not close enough to its preferred state, like adequate cash flow?
2173980	2185050	252	E	0.97	I think that just seems like a really interesting progression from where the state of the art of dynamic, nonlinear dynamic systems is the way we model businesses now.
2185680	2187516	253	E	0.98	Well, that's the way some of us do it.
2187538	2195128	254	E	1.0	A lot of people use a spreadsheet, but this would just seem like a potentially tremendous advancement.
2195304	2195644	255	B	0.95703	Yeah.
2195682	2206800	256	A	0.67	And then just a few notes then, John, this Stephen Fox who's also joined and talked about industrial engineering, he's recently had this paper come out just a couple of days ago.
2206950	2218144	257	A	0.88	And ironically, a spreadsheet is provided in this paper, but this is also in practice in several places in the world in startup ecosystems, and it's very academic influenced.
2218192	2228250	258	A	1.0	And then one other more conceptual note, Cadcad, which is the complex systems modeling software, and I know some of you are involved in Cadcad learning as well.
2228860	2233940	259	A	0.99997	They describe it as a language for encoding generalized dynamical systems.
2234100	2235976	260	A	1.0	And that is what it is.
2236158	2245448	261	A	0.9991	Active Block, for instance, is our project where Yaakob has done much of the initial work that is implementing active inference in Cadcad.
2245544	2262640	262	A	0.99	And we have a whole litany of questions about the relationships between Bayes graphs, generalized dynamical systems variational inference, cadcad, which takes more of like a sampling based approach versus the variational approaches that we're discussing here in Active.
2262800	2282340	263	A	0.99	And it's going to be very interesting as this systems engineering, complex systems simulation, as well as tokenomic and other things becomes integrated with this analytical framework, especially if we can demonstrate a true concordance between active inference and GDS.
2282500	2287900	264	C	0.99991	John Lyle, I just wanted to say your comments are really spot on.
2287970	2298240	265	C	0.81714	Earlier comments, I think, if I can paraphrase, you had essentially said maybe even a dysfunctional society is performing active inference.
2298980	2311700	266	C	0.99	And then that would lead us to really to the key components then of that society or that social system is what is its set of preferred states and where is it placing its attention?
2312040	2343740	267	C	1.0	So if, say, an elite group of very wealthy people or powerful people are running the world and they're running it for their preferences, which is to maintain their wealth and to ensure that they stay on top, well, then the world, they could be performing functional, active inference, and the world could suffer the problems that that kind of system would offer.
2343890	2360000	268	C	1.0	On the other hand, in a highly democratic system, if people understand that they want clean air and clean water and peace and all that kind of stuff and then that's their set of preferred states and their attention is on that and they're performing active inference.
2363320	2365984	269	A	0.9992	Thank you, John Lyle.
2366032	2367140	270	A	0.52	And then Mike.
2368680	2372504	271	E	0.73	So John, I'm completely on board with that.
2372702	2374904	272	E	1.0	I would just amplify a little bit on that.
2374942	2382840	273	E	1.0	I would say to a certain extent preferences and societal decisions are emergent.
2383260	2393196	274	E	1.0	So you aren't going to find too many people in the world who are going to say they want to be starving or have war or whatever, right, and yet we do.
2393378	2405008	275	E	0.87	So the interesting thing is to me is how does the individual, I mean this is the whole build up, right?
2405094	2408080	276	E	1.0	How does the individual behavior somehow.
2409880	2410340	277	A	0.9054	Create.
2410410	2418176	278	E	1.0	An emergent system that has many bad outcomes even though potentially none of those are bad actors.
2418208	2419296	279	E	0.99995	Some of them are bad actors.
2419328	2421972	280	E	0.61431	But let's just take the simple case.
2422026	2424388	281	E	0.99923	There are no bad actors yet we get bad outcome.
2424484	2425528	282	E	0.99999	Why is that?
2425694	2432824	283	E	1.0	And we can observe that in existing systems and then we can ask the question, well why is that?
2432862	2437352	284	E	1.0	And then maybe if we understand why that is, maybe we can do something to improve.
2437416	2440284	285	A	1.0	Yes, great point.
2440322	2456524	286	A	1.0	And then just a short note, there was in our remote teams we've framed communication and information architectures as organizational affordances so that could assist with decision making, find alignment where people do have similar preferences, like a zone of proximate agreement.
2456572	2465380	287	A	1.0	In a negotiation context it might be broader, but no matter how broad it is, if you can't forage the path to it, it's going to be a failing system.
2465530	2474232	288	E	0.57281	Mike yeah, I just want to add, I think scaling or the scale factor is hugely important here.
2474286	2486540	289	E	1.0	So if we're talking about interactions amongst a handful of individuals, we're going to see different behaviors and outcomes than we might see on a global scale of cultural interaction.
2488160	2491230	290	A	1.0	Okay, and then the last comment on that john, go for it.
2493600	2496076	291	A	0.89576	If your hand is still up I don't hear you actually.
2496178	2496888	292	A	0.98	Okay.
2497074	2500640	293	A	0.98	Your microphone may have changed or can other people hear?
2500710	2503072	294	A	0.91474	John no.
2503206	2503840	295	A	1.0	Okay.
2503990	2505570	296	A	0.98316	Eric, go for it.
2506660	2507024	297	A	0.98389	Yeah.
2507062	2510390	298	D	0.69221	How does this all apply to a highly distributed system?
2511720	2513110	299	D	0.77	I don't see that.
2513560	2516070	300	D	1.0	Yes, like a society is.
2518840	2520148	301	A	0.99997	Good question.
2520314	2527544	302	A	1.0	The multi agent case is something that hasn't been studied across the board.
2527662	2527944	303	B	0.82603	But.
2527982	2530040	304	A	0.89	In 2021 with colleagues.
2531100	2538024	305	A	0.95424	This is like one of the early it's not the first multi agent simulation because there were multi agent simulations.
2538152	2546510	306	A	0.99999	However, it was the first active inference model involving stigma g, which is the feedback process with agents modifying their environments and so on.
2547700	2557308	307	A	0.99996	We can think about even a Nested distributed cognitive system as inheriting some sparsity from a causal perspective.
2557404	2568740	308	A	0.72906	Like there's more connections in the Bayes graph within the Nest mate's head as we're modeling it and then interactions induce like a sparsity between two brains and then they're always coupled with the environment and so on.
2568890	2590540	309	A	1.0	And that sparsity is a statistical convenience, but also it allows factorizability of models and the models may be factorized in a way where free energy calculations could be, for example, summed within a level of collective behavior.
2591120	2596372	310	A	1.0	I don't know if that's going that's not the solution in and of itself to the modeling.
2596536	2621910	311	A	0.68125	But when we have systems of like Nested Markov blankets, enclosing systems and closing systems and then also lateral interactions and interfaces like collective behavior, those systems are at least amenable to this kind of principled composition via their sparsity, which does map onto a causal architecture or at least a useful one of the real world.
2622780	2624952	312	A	0.98	So also remains to be seen.
2625086	2627610	313	A	0.99999	But I think that's a very important question.
2629420	2638376	314	E	0.44335	Lyle yeah, Eric, I would throw in on that question because society of course, broadly speaking is loosely coupled.
2638408	2648384	315	E	1.0	However, of course there are clicks and densely coupled areas that create the well documented complex connection graphs, right?
2648502	2651744	316	E	0.69	So that connection graph is emergent, right?
2651782	2656128	317	E	1.0	So the question is, I think this would be actually a really fascinating research project.
2656294	2666992	318	E	0.99999	Can we show that FEP would generate connection graphs or patterns of societal interactions similar to what has been observed?
2667056	2672232	319	E	0.98896	Right, so there's lots and lots of research on what those graphs look like.
2672366	2686168	320	E	1.0	So is it possible for us to or someone to use FEP to show how those kind of connection patterns would emerge?
2686264	2689788	321	E	0.81	I think that's a really interesting question, yes.
2689954	2702736	322	A	1.0	How we threshold and parameterize those causal graphs, how we evaluate counterfactuals on those graphs and that's related to the problem of structured learning.
2702918	2710208	323	A	0.99928	But Bayesian model selection and other sort of hierarchical Bayesian methods have the tools.
2710304	2720340	324	A	0.99961	There also just quick pointer to the project ideas table there's some very interesting projects that people have suggested.
2720760	2727384	325	A	0.24271	Jakub, no big deal, sounds like a good one, but we can absolutely do it.
2727422	2750770	326	A	1.0	And that's one of the advantages of being in an activity driven, participatory research and education space is we're hopefully going to be able to help each other identify those projects and where there has or hasn't been overlap and then scaffold those projects, support them and then provide them like a place to communicate about the project.
2751460	2755388	327	A	0.92	Playing into the ontology active blockprints.
2755564	2764048	328	A	1.0	All these pieces that one researcher working by themselves would have just not those affordances.
2764224	2767350	329	A	0.99977	Let's just try to quickly look at the last several questions.
2770200	2775128	330	A	0.80412	Must all preferred states and strategies be ultimately linked to survival in some way?
2775214	2781652	331	A	0.98148	Or in the case of some organisms, can free energy be related to something other than survival?
2781796	2784364	332	A	0.59	So just a quick thought on that.
2784402	2792300	333	A	1.0	In the context of repeated measurements yes, survival is the capacity for repeated measurements.
2793680	2800828	334	A	0.54	Free energy energies for domain specific models can be made that have nothing to do with survival.
2801004	2804370	335	A	0.64	And I don't think that there's any contradiction there.
2805060	2810930	336	A	0.93443	John, I still don't hear you, actually.
2818730	2821400	337	A	0.95613	Rohan and then anyone else who raises their hand.
2823530	2824600	338	F	0.99899	Yeah, hi.
2825290	2833340	339	F	0.68	So I was actually wondering because there's no treatment of time in any of these methods, right?
2836270	2839322	340	F	1.0	Is there any accommodation made?
2839456	2853842	341	F	1.0	So if you're sampling something, let's say you sample at a minute frequency, you're getting a certain set of events, whereas if you're sampling at a much higher frequency, you would get a very different, much more noisy data set.
2853896	2859518	342	F	0.99993	But that might be essential to capture certain things that might actually enable survival.
2859614	2863380	343	F	0.99998	Maybe there's certain events that act only at certain times.
2863930	2869366	344	F	1.0	So from the perspective of repeated measurement right.
2869468	2882650	345	F	0.95	So I think free energy principle, as it relates to survival, could it just be related to some sort of creating an internal clock for repeated measurement?
2883230	2884460	346	A	0.99996	Great question.
2885550	2886058	347	A	1.0	Yes.
2886144	2892218	348	A	0.83	So far it's been almost time independent, as you suggest.
2892394	2898714	349	A	0.81194	But we're going to be dealing with two ways to deal with time in chapter four and beyond.
2898842	2907780	350	A	0.73	And that's like a discrete time formalization where future and past states are explicitly modeled, partially observable Markov decision process.
2908630	2916386	351	A	1.0	And then also a continuous time variance where future and past time points are not explicitly modeled.
2916498	2927660	352	A	0.99999	However, a Taylor series approximation, higher and higher derivatives of a function are utilized to glean an approximation to the future behavior of a function.
2928190	2930538	353	A	0.99999	Those are two different ways of dealing with time.
2930624	2941514	354	A	1.0	And then you talked about, like, sampling rate, and I think you'll see many connections and ways to apply that.
2941712	2953742	355	A	1.0	For example, you could imagine, like, if the sensor is every second, but you're able to think ten times per second, or what about when the sensor is every 10 seconds, but you're only able to think over this timescale.
2953886	2961058	356	A	0.57	And it's those kinds of situations where actually the frequencies are happening differently that we also might be able to address.
2961224	2961650	357	A	0.97	Yes.
2961720	2964462	358	F	0.59425	Rohan yeah.
2964616	2979062	359	F	0.9762	Also, like, if there are multiple sensors, some of them react quickly, some of them react slowly, or if there's just or if we look at active inferences, some sort of model averaging phenomena.
2979126	2979498	360	F	0.59081	Right.
2979584	2990910	361	F	1.0	So you have a model that runs really fast, that reacts really quickly and produces predictions really quickly, and the other one acts more slowly.
2991410	2996880	362	F	0.9998	Would those be valid targets in any sense?
2997970	3002634	363	A	1.0	Yes, I think it's a very interesting question.
3002692	3017880	364	A	0.51589	I'll just add it here just because it was where we were discussing it, like about different timescales and the way that cognitive clock rates for example and sensory clock rates and then the timescale events, the statistical regularities in the world happen.
3019770	3027894	365	A	0.67	In model stream 4.1 with DeVries and colleagues they talked about the message passing in a factor graph.
3028022	3039050	366	A	0.98	So anytime that there's a bayes graph there's a way to accomplish variational inference on that base graph using message passing techniques.
3039570	3042814	367	A	0.99962	That's what their package is about for any lab.
3043012	3052506	368	A	1.0	And then what they hinted at towards the end is actually this reactive message passing development which uses reactive programming techniques.
3052618	3066626	369	A	0.92	So whereas in message passing, at least in the 40 factor graph formalization it's like you crank the model and a message is passed amongst every node or there's like a given execution order of messages that are passed for the entire graph.
3066818	3077250	370	A	0.99999	However, the reactive message passing paradigm may allow like uncoupling of the frequency of message passing.
3077410	3086106	371	A	0.96	So you might have one prior that gets one message per hour and then there's another distribution that gets one message per minute and another one is getting 1.
3086128	3089202	372	A	0.69581	Even that one could be doing model averaging of something much faster.
3089366	3093722	373	A	1.0	So there's many ways that I think your questions will be starting to be explored.
3093786	3102206	374	A	0.64514	Rohan and then John okay John, if.
3102228	3104562	375	G	0.99	Your mic is can you hear me now?
3104616	3105460	376	D	0.57	Oh good.
3106630	3122742	377	G	0.99995	On the question of survival, I think you would have to identify to answer it, you'd have to identify first what is the organism or what is the agent that you're talking about because obviously if it's an individual person, a person might sacrifice their life for others.
3122796	3140542	378	G	0.5	So then survival is not necessarily the main driver but if it's a society then any individual might not survive but society as a whole might.
3140676	3152782	379	G	1.0	I suspect in the bigger picture that it's not really survival of a species it's probably the ability to the propagation of information somehow.
3152846	3160020	380	G	0.99995	That's what I would guess in the biggest picture that's probably what everything is doing is propagating information.
3160950	3175430	381	A	0.82	And Mike Levin has also explored how changes in the scope of the self can lead to an organism with reduced fitness as a function of a cancer with increased fitness and vision, so to speak.
3175580	3184700	382	A	1.0	And so just because there's an imperative or normative way that we model behavior doesn't mean that everything works or anything like that.
3185950	3186700	383	A	1.0	Yes.
3187230	3191598	384	A	0.91019	Ali yes.
3191684	3211458	385	B	0.99872	Adding to what John said well, yes, again, I believe here survival doesn't necessarily mean biological survival and actually it has a much broader sense and it means the existence of things.
3211544	3239494	386	B	0.99996	Actually it's a metaphysical concept here because as I said, Karl Friston has defined the existence or the prerequisite of existence as having two parameters or two features namely being an ergotic system and having markup blankets.
3239622	3253202	387	B	1.0	So any system which has these any system which has these two properties can basically be considered as an existing system or we can call it a surviving system.
3253336	3264302	388	A	0.51518	Here, just in our last minutes before we go to tools touch on some of these points can markup blanket be considered a decoupling mechanism?
3264446	3267910	389	A	1.0	So can anything mathematical be considered a mechanism?
3269450	3271174	390	A	0.99996	People use terms in different ways.
3271212	3278450	391	A	1.0	So that just to raise the point that a linear aggression on height and weight isn't a mechanism of height and weight, it's just a descriptor.
3278530	3284746	392	A	1.0	So Markov blanket doesn't need to be any kind of mechanism at all, it doesn't need to cut nature at the joints or anything like that.
3284848	3296430	393	A	0.97059	That being said, there are ways in which one could think of the blanket again variously depending on how the real generative model and generative process separated as part of a Markov partition.
3297570	3312526	394	A	0.99995	Sometimes there's ways to think of it as how they're coupled, other times it is a statistical decoupling of a type, it's a partial information encapsulation, but it's not a total encapsulation and that way it is like an interface.
3312638	3330474	395	A	0.6	And yes, thanks to whomever has added this quote this is one reason why the transcripts of all of the live streams and discussions augmented with the ontology will be so helpful and searchable because we could find sentences that have raised similar points and address them.
3330512	3340560	396	A	0.77	So, good question and then just the last ones, maybe we can come back to this.
3341570	3349274	397	A	1.0	And then this one is a nice next step question thinking about friction.
3349322	3352420	398	A	1.0	What is the analogy to friction in a cognitive system?
3353270	3358850	399	A	0.99999	What is the stochastic fluctuation on our cognitive path of least action?
3360150	3364554	400	A	0.99996	What is that in the real world realism ontological claims?
3364702	3392960	401	A	1.0	And then from the behavioral modeling perspective, where are we using these equations and partitioning variance into a path or a flow of least action and a variable that is analogous to stochastic fluctuation or friction but doesn't take on any of the baggage of describing some feature or component or mechanism of the physical system.
3393330	3398606	402	A	1.0	So also a great question though and we'll leave this one in case people want to continue to address it.
3398788	3404210	403	A	1.0	So that brings us to the end of chapter three live meetings.
3404710	3423254	404	A	0.99994	Next week, we'll head into two weeks of chapter four, then two weeks of chapter five, and then we'll have two weeks to sort of ground ourselves, think about what we've learned, talk about project ideas, and then we'll be heading into the second cohort of the first half of the book.
3423452	3432598	405	A	1.0	And for those who are here who want to continue into the back nine, as it were, the second half of the textbook.
3432774	3443438	406	A	1.0	And also people are welcomed and encouraged to be facilitators or return participants in the second cohort first part because it's many coats of paint for everyone.
3443604	3446606	407	A	1.0	And so we want to provide that affordance to return again and again.
3446628	3452090	408	A	1.0	And again because the basics are the classics and the essence and the seed of innovation.
3452170	3456290	409	A	1.0	All this other important things that happen when we return and clarify.
3456790	3465746	410	A	0.99985	Also we've had to sort of do all of these entering of figures and equations for the first time but now that we have the architecture.
3465858	3473350	411	A	0.99999	People can focus on annotating them, or they can focus on adding new questions or improving the questions that others have written.
3476090	3490442	412	A	0.99993	If anyone else has any comments that they want to make while the recording is still occurring, I'll just give a few seconds for anyone to raise their hand and then we'll end this session and then take a 1 minute break.
3490496	3495610	413	A	1.0	And then in this room, we'll be continuing on with tools, organizational unit.
3495770	3513460	414	A	0.61	And if you want to continue speaking with people here about just any topic at all, you can head up to a room up top and then of course always you can join into the discord voice channels and just be working on things like during the math reading group or any other area rojan and then anyone else who raises their hand.
3516230	3520180	415	F	0.99872	Yeah, actually, sorry for this late part.
3520890	3534186	416	F	0.59773	I'm just curious, when you say the free energy principle, it's basically figuring out some set point of states, internal states that the agent wants to be with, right?
3534288	3539614	417	F	0.79007	It's not necessary that it actually couples to the real world.
3539652	3542254	418	F	1.0	So why wouldn't it be that?
3542452	3546000	419	F	0.78	Okay, it just becomes a brain in the VAT type of situation.
3548690	3553550	420	F	1.0	It just needs to find a set point that helps it survive.
3553990	3561938	421	F	0.86	So it doesn't have to actually model the real world, it just has to find a place and no matter what happens, just stay there.
3562024	3564330	422	F	1.0	So it's not really dynamic.
3564510	3568070	423	F	0.61099	That could be that possibility.
3569130	3570290	424	A	1.0	It is dynamic.
3570370	3572150	425	A	1.0	It is explicitly modeling time.
3572220	3582634	426	A	1.0	And one can make a model just like a linear regression could be static, or you could use the linear regression technique and use it in I was more referring it.
3582752	3587194	427	F	0.95	So if you look at some of the reinforcement, deep reinforcement learning models, right?
3587232	3589482	428	F	0.99997	They usually find some trick within the game.
3589536	3605650	429	F	0.82444	Like if you're looking at Atari games and you say maximize the score, for example, so it tries to find, okay, I can maximize the score by doing the simplest thing that doesn't require me to progress in any way, but it would increase the score.
3606710	3607506	430	A	0.87	Okay?
3607688	3615060	431	A	0.65	So yes, these are important things, so write them down so that we can have infinite discourse on them.
3616230	3625478	432	A	1.0	The brain, the VAT does still have an interface with the environment, whether it's receive only and then you brought up like it doesn't have to be like modeling the quote real world.
3625644	3642080	433	A	1.0	This is the architecture that helps us bypass that and say, right, the particulate states, the particular states, which are the blanket states and the internal states are doing inference, acting as if they're doing inference on external states.
3642450	3648990	434	A	1.0	So it's perfectly compatible with scientific realism, scientific surrealism, aesthetic surrealism.
3654370	3662526	435	F	0.99	It could be hallucinating the world, and it's actually just doing inference on the hallucination rather than actual reality as such.
3662708	3676630	436	A	0.75241	Anil Seth and many others who speak of that reality as a controlled hallucination, they're 2ft in that territory without any qualms and feeling like it addresses questions that have been unaddressed by other perspectives.
3678650	3682038	437	F	0.99	Okay, so I'll just put this there.
3682204	3682870	438	A	0.99588	Cool.
3683020	3684040	439	A	0.99933	Thank you, everybody.
