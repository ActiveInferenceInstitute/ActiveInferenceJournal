1690	67300	00:01	It is June 16, 2022, and it's meeting seven of the active textbook textbook group Cohort one. We'll take a look at the math in our move through chapter three. It's not too late to add more questions or to upvote questions.	This is meeting of the active textbook textbook group Cohort one	 textbook discussion
68150	276520	01:08	Karl Frisden's Beyond the Desert Landscape argues for bottom up and top down approaches to understanding embodied exchange with the environment. If anyone likes to gain a deeper understanding about these conceptual characterizations, I highly, highly recommend this chapter of this book.	Ali: I changed my mind about low road and high road after reading chapter three	The High Road and the Desert Landscape
277610	608920	04:37	It's worth restating just how unusual it is to interpret P as a measure of both probabilities and preferences. It's something that we'll be able to have very clear answers for thanks to the work of annotating equations. Everybody will benefit when we align our regime of attention to actually what it says.	Question: Using P as both probabilities and preferences in equations is unorthodox	Free Energy: The ontology of probabilities and preferences
612620	906520	10:12	Expectation is a mathematical operator. Preference is a statement. It can refer to predictions about the mean or the mode or other attributes of a future time point. It's one of the essential architectural decisions in active inference that enable it's necessity and sufficiency complex.	The relationship between preference and expectation is important in active inference	Preference and Expectation
913240	983900	15:13	Ali: It seems you're still not removing the free variable of what the preference of the agent organism is. It's a little bit of an unnatural act. But you haven't solved any other problem. The deeper problem of what should the organism attempt to achieve the goals.	Ali: It seems you're still not removing the free variable of preference	Optimization with a Free Variable
988720	1276970	16:28	The risk is defined as the divergence between the preference and the states. On both sides there's a conditioning vertical line on policy selection. This is comparing the relative expected ambiguity and risk conditioned upon different specific policies.	Let's look at equation 2.6. What does this speak to with respect to preferences and expectations	Policy Selection under the Kullback Leibler
1279660	1666900	21:19	The preferences is not really spelled out very much in this chapter. How do you achieve preferences under that equation? We're trying to minimize g of pi better policies have a lower score. This will lead us to select policies that can be expected to bring alignment between observations and preferences.	Eric: How do you achieve preferences under that equation	KL divergence and preferences
1673020	2093820	27:53	To what extent are these techniques valuable in what I would call social systems of wide ranging sorts. This model could be parameterized to fit a thriving or a failing society along various different dimensions. There's multiple startups and applications that are explicitly pursuing this angle.

2093970	2764048	34:53	FEP can potentially be applied to any dynamical system with Ergodicity. When does a business dissipate when it's not close enough to its preferred state, like adequate cash flow? And it's going to be very interesting as systems engineering, complex systems simulation becomes integrated with this analytical framework.	Almost all dynamical systems can be potentially modeled with FEP	Functional Inference in Dynamical Systems
2764224	3105460	46:04	Can all preferred states and strategies be ultimately linked to survival in some way? Or in the case of some organisms, can free energy be related to something other than survival? In the context of repeated measurements yes, survival is the capacity for repeated measurements.	Free energy principle may be related to the capacity for repeated measurements	Free Energy and Survival in Science
3106630	3253202	51:46	On the question of survival, I think you would have to identify to answer it. I suspect in the bigger picture that it's not really survival of a species it's probably the ability to the propagation of information somehow. Survival doesn't necessarily mean biological survival and it has a much broader sense and it means the existence of things.	Ali: Survival is probably the ability to the propagation of information somehow	On the question of survival
3253336	3398606	54:13	Can anything mathematical be considered a mechanism? People use terms in different ways. What's the analogy to friction in a cognitive system? What is the stochastic fluctuation on our cognitive path of least action?	Can markup blanket be considered a decoupling mechanism	Can Markov Blanket Be a Decoupling Mechanism?
3398788	3513460	56:38	Next week, we'll head into two weeks of chapter four and five. And then we'll be heading into the second cohort of the first half of the book. People are welcomed and encouraged to be facilitators or return participants in the second cohorts first part. If you want to continue speaking with people about just any topic, you can head up to a room up top.	This concludes chapter three of the first half of the textbook	End of Chapter 3 Live Meetings
3516230	3684040	58:36	The VAT doesn't have to actually model the real world, it just has to find a place and no matter what happens, just stay there. It's perfectly compatible with scientific realism, scientific surrealism, aesthetic surrealism. It could be hallucinating the world, and it's actually just doing inference on the hallucination rather than actual reality.	Free energy principle doesn't have to model the real world, right	Inference from the Free Energy Principle
