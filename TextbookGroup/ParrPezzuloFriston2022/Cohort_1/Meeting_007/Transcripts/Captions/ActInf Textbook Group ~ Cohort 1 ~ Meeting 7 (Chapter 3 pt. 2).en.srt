1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,160
hello everyone it is june 16th 2022 and

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,559
it's meeting seven of the active

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,120
textbook textbook group cohort one

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,920
we're in our second discussion of

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,400
chapter three

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,439
today we'll be looking at the questions

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,519
that haven't been addressed so the ones

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
without thumbs

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,800
and

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,119
also it's not too late to add more

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,238
questions or to upvote questions

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
and then additionally

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,079
since the

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
math learning group has been

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
quite active

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,840
in providing synchronous

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,160
affordances for conversation around

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,879
some of the background on the math as

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,960
well as some aspects of the equations

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,800
that we'll go through today

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,079
and also even to like applications of

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,840
the math and developing notebooks and

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
such

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,800
we'll

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
take a look at the math

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,438
in our

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,159
move through chapter 3.

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
before we go to the questions does

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
anyone

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,560
have anything that they just want to

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
like remark on chapter 3

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,119
ali and then anyone else

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,439
yeah

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,840
well last week i talked about how i

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,720
changed my mind about these

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,200
bottom up and top down characterizations

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,960
of low road and

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
high road respectively after reading

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
chapter three

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,960
but it turns out that they are in fact

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,720
bottom half and top down approaches

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
after all you see

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
i came across this uh in my opinion

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
undeservedly lesser known piece of

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
beautiful beautiful writing by carl

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
fristan

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,920
which explicitly argues for such

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,880
characterizations and

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,040
the philosophical importance

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
of this distinction

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
it's called beyond the desert landscape

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
and it's inconspicuously hidden

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,320
in this book andy clark and his critics

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
so

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
i i'd like to quote um a couple of

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
sentences from this

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
writing

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
uh well

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
he writes code

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
the high road stands in for a top-down

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,640
approach that starts by asking

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
fundamental questions about the

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,239
necessary properties

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,040
things must possess if they exist using

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,840
mathematical variational principles one

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
can then show that existence is an

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
embodied exchange of a creature

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
with its environment that necessarily

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
entails predictive processing as one

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
aspect of the self-evidencing mechanics

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
the low road is the purpose the agenda

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
established by

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
is the

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,200
is to pursue the agenda established by

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
content hellholtz and generalize in a

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
bottom-up way the capacity for inference

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
and prediction to see how far it takes

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
us in understanding embodied exchange

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,879
with the environment so if anyone likes

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,560
to

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
gain a deeper understanding about these

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,480
conceptual um characterizations i highly

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
highly recommend

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
this

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,400
chapter of this book and and quite

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
unusually for a frist in writing uh it

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,280
also lacks

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,239
any mathematical formalism it doesn't

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
include a single mathematical equation

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
there

91
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
thank you

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
yeah in a recent stream we also talked

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
about the desert landscape and clark's

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
concern

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,879
was that

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,000
we might do away with what populates our

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
implicitly assumed to be rich ecosystems

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,519
of psychology philosophy

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,239
and so on with important ecosystem

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,280
players

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,239
like

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,159
goals

103
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,920
and so the fear or concern was that we

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,120
might be in a quiet and desert landscape

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
if we replace

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
some of these again implicitly or

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,319
explicitly stated to be rich constructs

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,920
like goals and we're like well it's just

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
distribution matching

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
then we've made some sort of like a

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,279
desert monoculture and that would be um

112
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
dip operate of

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
what

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
what what does clark say to his desert

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
living critics

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
um all right

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
if anyone else

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,919
has a thought they can raise their hand

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,600
otherwise we can look at the questions

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,560
okay

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
so this first

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
question

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
if one defines preferred states as

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
expected states one can say living

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
organisms must minimize the surprise of

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
their sensory observations

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
i'm not clear on the ontology here

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,840
is it that preference is the same as

129
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,240
expectation or that formally we can use

130
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
them in the same equation

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
is that an ontological claim

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
and is the free energy in physics an

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,600
analogy or an ontological assertion

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
about how things really are

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,240
so one starting place

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,199
was uh i i found the slide and so wanted

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,759
to highlight it this was in

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,199
free energy

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,120
a user's guide which was live stream

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
number 37

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
um the slides will be probably a little

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
bigger

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
um

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,240
it's worth restating just how unusual it

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
is to interpret p as a measure of both

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,360
probabilities and preferences

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,199
they both start with p though

148
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,400
there's nothing wrong with treating a

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
distribution as a measure of preferences

150
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
because distributions can have different

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
interpretations

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
but what's unorthodox and in need of

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
justification is giving the same

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
mathematical term

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,319
two different interpretations within the

156
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,280
same equation

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
they then add some more details

158
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,400
that unpack a little bit about how

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
it is the case that the same

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
term p

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,039
can be utilized

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,240
uh as

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,199
uh

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,919
both a probability

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
and a preference

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,720
and then they even extended it into a

167
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
third p

168
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,199
the ph fitness

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,000
where

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
by

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
allowing your probabilities and your

172
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
preferences to converge to reduce the

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
divergence between those two

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
distributions

175
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
then

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
fitness is achieved

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,400
and so

178
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
they provided a

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,160
restatement

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
of the way that that is implemented

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,840
and then

182
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,120
uh highlighted an additional

183
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,560
grounding or interpretive line

184
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,840
so that's

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,559
at least one part of that question

186
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,639
and also to look towards the equations

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,520
it's

188
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
something that we'll be able to

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
have very clear answers for and thanks

190
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,720
to the work of ali and blue and

191
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
others who have been

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
annotating equations

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
so for example in equation 3.1

194
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,199
or we can look at like box one

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,880
equation one

196
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
which is like a markov blanket

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,240
definition

198
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,800
in the description fields

199
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
we have a natural language

200
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,479
description

201
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,680
and then the terms that are used

202
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,840
in the description

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
are those that are referenced using

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,120
variables

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
so that will help us

206
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
translate across natural language of

207
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,879
different human languages

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,479
the discrete and continuous time

209
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
formalisms which we're going to explore

210
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
in this textbook

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
also

212
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,800
identical or isomorphic or related

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
formalisms in other papers which

214
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
sometimes are using the same notation

215
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,879
letters

216
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
but not always

217
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
but we could have another column for

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,599
first in 2019

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
and here's first in 2013

220
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
and then there's a conversation to be

221
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
had about where they align or don't and

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
that's the kind of annotation work that

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
somebody can engage in from the

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
publications and that also helps us

225
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
connect it to the the programmatic

226
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
implementations

227
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
like in active block rinse

228
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,839
or in other scripts

229
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,160
so that even that we can promote

230
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
norms and practices around variable

231
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,279
naming

232
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,399
in math

233
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
and in programming

234
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,800
but also where there is divergences or

235
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
differences which are important for

236
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,880
innovating and evolving the norms

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,920
we can also map them pretty coherently

238
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
so all the equations for three

239
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
can be um

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
red

241
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,120
naturally

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
so we discussed this a lot in the math

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
group and and again a lot of people

244
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,399
contributed to this

245
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
with one of the goals or

246
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
functions being that whenever we are

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
going to bring up an equation

248
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
like if there's a question about

249
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
equation 3.1

250
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
we can just

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
briefly

252
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
read

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,200
the current state of the description

254
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
because whether you're super familiar

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
with the letters and variables and how

256
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
they're concatenated

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,440
or whether it's just like a first pass

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
on your

259
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
seeing this equation

260
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
everybody will benefit when we align our

261
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
regime of attention to actually what it

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
says

263
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
and then that will help us do many many

264
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
other things

265
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
but to return back to this

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
question

267
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,760
um

268
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
does anyone

269
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,320
want to raise their hand and give a

270
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
thought

271
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,480
on

272
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
the relationship between preference and

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
expectation

274
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
ontological claims

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,399
about preference

276
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
and its relationship with expectation

277
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,640
and more generally

278
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
is the free energy

279
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,560
something that isn't

280
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,680
analogy

281
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,519
or mathematical

282
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,240
isomorphism or an equation that rhymes

283
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
or is it also an assertion

284
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,279
it's an equation that rhymes

285
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,399
what makes you say that no not just

286
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
because

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
just because it's cute that's all

288
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
uh i just joined the conversation but

289
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
preference and expectation i wouldn't

290
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,240
think they were

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
at all referring to the same thing

292
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,040
i mean expectation is a mathematical

293
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,519
operator

294
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,079
preference is

295
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
a statement

296
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,440
yes

297
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
expectation is used in multiple ways

298
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,880
it can refer to

299
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,079
predictions about the mean or the mode

300
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
or other attributes of a future time

301
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,880
point like i'm expecting uh you know

302
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
what are you expecting to happen on next

303
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,920
monday

304
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,720
right right also expectation can refer

305
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,560
and that's how it's used with the fancy

306
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
e

307
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,160
to refer to the expected value

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,680
of a distribution which for a gaussian

309
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
is

310
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
the mode

311
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,800
in the center of the symmetric peak

312
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
and that doesn't need to be about a

313
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
future time point

314
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,610
that can just be the expectation

315
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,320
[Music]

316
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,279
of the height of the classroom right now

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
does it's not saying that's what we're

318
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
expecting it to be in a year

319
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,360
as it might be used conversationally but

320
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,279
it's referring to just like the average

321
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,079
of a distribution

322
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,720
right

323
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,279
mathematically it's an operator and

324
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
verbally it can be

325
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,040
a prediction or a desire or something

326
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
yes

327
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,720
yes

328
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
and then yeah again in 37 and elsewhere

329
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,880
um

330
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
it'll be worth returning to this again

331
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
and again because it's one of the

332
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,680
essential

333
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
architectural

334
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,399
decisions in active inference

335
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
that enable

336
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,920
it's

337
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
part of the necessity and sufficiency

338
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,959
complex i don't know whether this is one

339
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,079
one the whole

340
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,320
um meat of it but it's part of what

341
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
allows

342
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,959
the dispensal of like an explicit reward

343
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,399
term

344
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,120
like

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
a homeostatic reinforcement reward

346
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
driven learner

347
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
would be like i'm more rewarded by being

348
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
in my homeostatic range

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,360
and then there needs to be this

350
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
architecture around well how are we

351
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
going to pursue reward

352
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
alternatively

353
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
an organism

354
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
trying to maintain homeostasis

355
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
realism or us modeling an organism that

356
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
is maintaining homeostasis

357
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
instrumentalism

358
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
we can just say

359
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
it expects to be

360
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
in the range that conversationally we're

361
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,720
going to describe as a preference

362
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
how do we know we put the animal in the

363
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,160
room and it's spending a lot of its time

364
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
on this warmer side

365
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
it prefers to be there

366
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
we also expect it to be there

367
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,279
we're less surprised when we see it

368
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,959
there

369
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,040
so then

370
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
it's possible to as they write here

371
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,760
interpret that

372
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
p

373
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
location distribution in the room for

374
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
the animal that we're observing or the

375
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,399
temperature distribution for the body in

376
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
the homeostatic context

377
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
as being a probability density

378
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
over temperatures over locations

379
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
as well as

380
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,519
reflecting the preferences

381
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,920
not the qualia or the phenomenology or

382
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,639
anything like too far out about what it

383
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,800
means to prefer where preferences arise

384
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
from whether they're fixed or learned in

385
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
the model all these like many many

386
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,560
trails that can come out of that

387
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
but just at this like

388
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,519
essential layer

389
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,519
we don't need to interpolate a reward

390
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,560
term

391
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,959
between what is expected

392
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,439
and what is preferred

393
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,920
any other comments from someone yes eric

394
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,719
and then anyone else

395
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,279
yeah i just um just to remark on that

396
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,760
it seems you're still not removing the

397
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,079
free variable of what the preference of

398
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,040
the

399
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,279
agent organism is

400
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,639
you're just holding it you're putting in

401
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,279
a different place so that you can

402
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,759
use it in this unified equation

403
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,360
but

404
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
you still have this

405
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
it's a pre variable okay what what do

406
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,639
you want to do okay i'm going to call

407
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,079
that an expectation and that's what i'm

408
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:46,880
going to

409
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
try to drive for when i uh optimize my

410
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
my variational

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
free energy

412
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
but it in that sense it's um it's kind

413
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
of a convenience or it's a trick it's a

414
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
little bit of an unnatural act i don't

415
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
know like that way i think of it for a

416
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
purpose

417
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,320
but

418
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
there's nothing

419
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
um

420
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,279
you haven't solved any other problem and

421
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
you know the deeper problem of

422
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
what should the organism attempt to

423
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,279
achieve the goals

424
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,480
yes

425
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,279
thanks ali

426
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,600
uh well

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
i think it also

428
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,959
might be quite helpful to refer back to

429
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,440
chapter 2 uh on page 36 i think yeah

430
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,520
page 36 uh

431
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,120
[Music]

432
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
i think

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
well here

434
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,519
they have actually

435
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
distinguished between the term

436
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
prediction and exactly yes here the term

437
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
prediction and expectation quite

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
explicitly

439
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,719
in terms of equation 2.6 so

440
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
okay

441
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,799
so let's look at equation 2.6

442
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,359
okay a few of the were all um

443
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,679
that we don't have the third line

444
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,640
um

445
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,559
fully described

446
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,599
but just here's the third line what does

447
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,359
this speak to with respect to

448
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,719
preferences and expectations

449
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
but here the preference actually is in

450
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,000
the second term the

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
callback library divergence here yeah

452
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,720
and

453
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,440
so

454
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
it's actually

455
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
inherent in the second term and the

456
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,480
expectation expected ambiguity

457
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,120
uh as it speaks for itself is the first

458
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,480
term so

459
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
we have here

460
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,679
uh

461
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
the risk is defined as the divergence

462
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,400
between the pre the preference and the

463
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,559
states so

464
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,160
i think that we can see the preference

465
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
in this equation as well

466
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,240
one note here is like that this g is

467
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
equal to the first the seconds

468
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,000
and um

469
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
this line

470
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
but one way that um we can understand

471
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
the relationship of the second and the

472
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
third line

473
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,919
is like they're very similar the first

474
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
term is identical

475
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
here

476
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,039
the only difference is that instead of a

477
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,000
y

478
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
we see an x

479
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,640
and so this is like x being the hidden

480
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,320
state and y being the observation

481
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,120
in the case where it's a fully

482
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,919
observable markov process

483
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,400
then the outcomes and the hidden states

484
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
are going to be like equal uncertainty

485
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,360
about them

486
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
because

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
in that case it's functionally that the

488
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,520
hidden states are observables

489
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
however if there's any amount of

490
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
ambiguity like the a matrix between the

491
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,400
hidden state and the observable

492
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
then there's always going to be more

493
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,679
uncertainty about the hidden state

494
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,160
relative to the observable

495
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
and then

496
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,120
importantly on both sides

497
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,160
there's a conditioning vertical line on

498
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,720
policy selection

499
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,039
and so that is what prevents us from

500
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,120
getting into like well what if it's 95

501
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,440
correct or 96 or 97 correct or any of

502
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
these sort of like model

503
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
diminishing returns debates

504
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,559
it's a

505
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,120
functional that's calculated for each

506
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,320
policy

507
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,880
that have been been

508
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
um possible of composing given the

509
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
affordances a policy is just a sequence

510
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
of actions so if there's four movement

511
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
affordances

512
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,240
there's four policies of time depth one

513
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
there's 16 policies of time depth two

514
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,280
and so on and for whatever in this

515
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,200
discrete formalism

516
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
finite set of policies there are

517
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
they're evaluated here

518
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,880
and then

519
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,280
there's a policy selection

520
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,600
that could choose the lowest

521
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
expected free energy or it could

522
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
proportionally choose from them with

523
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,760
different kinds of waiting and so on but

524
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,640
this is comparing the relative expected

525
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,280
ambiguity and risk

526
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
conditioned upon different specific

527
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
policies

528
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
and there's a process by which those

529
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
specific policies can be enumerated

530
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,039
and then this is a process by which

531
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,960
they're going to be evaluated

532
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
and then there's a policy selection by

533
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,039
which they're selected

534
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,400
so

535
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
organisms that fail to do this

536
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,679
adequately enough will be dissipated

537
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,480
or

538
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
systems

539
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,400
whether it's just um a molecular system

540
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,120
or some other kind of statistical system

541
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
that failed to do this well enough

542
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,480
to remain being that kind of thing

543
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,159
are not amenable to repeated

544
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
measurements

545
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
they are not that thing but things that

546
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
remain being that thing

547
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,880
for the time horizon of observations

548
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
will be selecting policies that are

549
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,400
consistent with this

550
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,000
can ask a question about this yeah about

551
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
this equation here

552
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,640
um

553
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
say let the second line

554
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,600
so i would have expected

555
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,159
so first of all see the the preferences

556
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
is not really spelled out very much in

557
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
this chapter and i don't know where it

558
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,880
will be

559
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
um

560
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
but um i would have expected something

561
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,600
more like preferences given

562
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,120
observations like you know the

563
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
observations of

564
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,000
what's what's happening in the world

565
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
that we can measure that's observation

566
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
why

567
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
and how does that

568
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
and how does that fit with my

569
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
preferences so what i want to optimize

570
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,840
is my preference

571
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,559
the achievement of my preferences

572
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,520
as

573
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,679
delivered by the observations

574
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,360
now i understand in that

575
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
that in that second equation

576
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
you're going to do a divergence

577
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,280
between observations the uh the tildes

578
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,480
the y tildes so you can't flip around p

579
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
of c given y tilde there

580
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
so

581
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
can somebody explain to me how this all

582
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,840
fits together then how do you achieve

583
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
preferences

584
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
under that equation

585
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,080
all give one

586
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,919
um thought and and i absolutely agree to

587
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
the first point which is like c is just

588
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,880
like

589
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,600
i don't even know if it's

590
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,159
described in this chapter

591
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
like it just

592
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,640
34 i think

593
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
34.

594
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
uh let me check it again

595
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,960
um

596
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,039
i mean there is this

597
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,960
yeah he says basically

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,440
parameter includes preferences but that

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
includes parameter yeah and also if

600
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,400
you're uh if you go to uh section 7.4 i

601
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
think

602
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
yeah in that section

603
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,880
it is untangled why these two parameters

604
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
are related and how these two parameters

605
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,840
are related to each other

606
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,280
section

607
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
yeah yeah i mean

608
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,559
like

609
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,080
there's there's that's like multiple

610
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
scales of where the information is not

611
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,360
provided

612
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,480
before when it needs to be provided

613
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
which is like this i

614
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
have made as just a helpful diagram of

615
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
the partially observable markov decision

616
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
process

617
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,640
which is c is the preferences and it

618
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
influences how g

619
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
evaluates policies which are generated

620
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,960
from affordances over a given time

621
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,919
horizon policies intervene upon how

622
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,240
hidden states change in the world

623
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
and there's there's more in different

624
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
readings but to return to um eric's

625
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
question and then again anyone with the

626
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
raised hand so

627
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
the question was whether we're comparing

628
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,679
outcomes

629
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,440
or states

630
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,559
how does this second term

631
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,480
help us realize our preference

632
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
well

633
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
when is the kl we're trying to minimize

634
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,440
g of pi

635
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
better policies have a lower score it's

636
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,320
like um golf i guess

637
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
or you could add negatives and make it

638
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
higher um and also just

639
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,559
it's an interesting note like climbing

640
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,120
mount improbable biologists often think

641
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
about the fitness peak

642
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
and climbing to fitness peaks

643
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
whereas for a physicist it's often

644
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,600
framed and also like

645
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
computer science gradient descending

646
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,360
and local minima global minima

647
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,400
but they're

648
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,279
just

649
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,480
actually like

650
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,919
the same landscape with some negative

651
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,880
signs

652
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
so the kl divergence and here we're

653
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
trying to minimize

654
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,919
if it's zero

655
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,440
that would mean like

656
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,159
we are perfectly realizing

657
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,559
our preference

658
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,520
so

659
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,679
let's just say that there's two policies

660
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,360
that we're comparing between

661
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,039
and one of them is going to perfectly

662
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,120
realize our preferences the other one

663
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,159
isn't so we have like pi one and pi two

664
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,520
and we're going to be calculating the kl

665
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
divergence of the outcomes

666
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,279
that we're expecting under the

667
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,360
variational distribution queue under

668
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,720
policy one

669
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,279
and under policy two

670
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,720
so if policy one is going to perfectly

671
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,320
realize our our uh if the outcomes of

672
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,440
policy one are expected to perfectly

673
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,120
realize our preferences

674
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,159
this term will be zero

675
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,279
whereas if policy two is going to

676
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,240
be expected to result in

677
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
an outcome distribution that's not

678
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
aligned with our preferences it doesn't

679
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,039
get penalized here

680
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
this is just evaluated as a as a value

681
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
nor does it get penalized here

682
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,000
because in this case of fixed

683
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
preferences that's also not changing

684
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
as we iterate through policies however

685
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
there would be a divergence that would

686
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,279
be non-zero like all divergences are

687
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,919
between the inferior policy and the

688
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,279
superior policy so by iterating over the

689
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,880
finite set of policies that we have

690
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,480
taking this term

691
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,919
and just leaving to the side for now

692
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,080
only the kl divergence

693
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,799
this will lead us to select policies

694
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,080
that can be expected to bring alignment

695
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
between the observations conditioned on

696
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,039
policy and our preferences preferred

697
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,840
outcome distribution

698
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
thank you that's very helpful so just to

699
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
kind of say that slightly differently is

700
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
given your preferences that's that

701
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,520
that's going to imply some outcomes

702
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
and what you're trying to do with that

703
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
kl that vergence is trying to get the

704
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,400
policy that will achieve those outcomes

705
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,120
so

706
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,320
if we

707
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,240
expect and prefer to be within the

708
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,039
homeostatic thermal range

709
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,799
and then the two policies in the

710
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,360
snowstorm are add the jacket or remove

711
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
the jacket

712
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
which one of those

713
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,320
are expected to

714
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
have the minimum divergence between us

715
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,960
being in the homeostatic range

716
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,000
and then the policy conditioned

717
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
expected outcomes

718
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
i'm going to have less divergence it

719
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,279
doesn't even mean you're going to live

720
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,480
it just means i'm going to have less

721
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,760
divergence by having the jacket on in

722
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
the snowstorm than by taking it off

723
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,840
which is going to move the expected

724
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,919
outcome distribution further from the

725
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,000
preference distribution which here is

726
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,200
fixed

727
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,919
but doesn't have to be fixed

728
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,279
okay

729
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,720
so we have several

730
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,720
um is anyone

731
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,559
here the person who has written any of

732
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
these questions so then we can just go

733
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,559
to that one

734
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,840
lyle

735
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,960
yes

736
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,799
there we go i think i'm i think i went

737
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,679
in here

738
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
okay so yeah i uh i wrote the one

739
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,039
that

740
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,760
is referring to the living organisms and

741
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,120
the question about

742
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,720
to what extent are these techniques

743
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
valuable in

744
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,679
what i would call social systems of

745
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,600
wide-ranging sorts

746
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,399
and

747
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,679
i know that this book at the outset

748
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,440
limits itself to

749
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,360
biological systems at least that's my

750
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,760
recollection from the introduction but

751
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,559
uh it just seems obvious to me that

752
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,840
this would have much broader

753
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,440
applicability

754
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,760
i'm curious what

755
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,200
sort of what the state of that is

756
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,279
well

757
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,520
um

758
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,919
do i hesitate to put anyone on the spot

759
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,440
john would you

760
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
give a first response there while i add

761
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
some resources

762
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,720
yeah

763
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,120
my first thought on that is

764
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,039
um

765
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
obviously

766
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,559
our civilization is struggling

767
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,399
and um

768
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,320
and civilizations have failed in the

769
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,159
past who collapsed

770
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
so it's not necessarily the case that

771
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
every social structure or societal

772
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
structure

773
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,919
is actually performing

774
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
functional active inference

775
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,159
but if we were a

776
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,399
highly functional organism if societies

777
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,480
were a highly functional organism

778
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
we would be doing something like active

779
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
inference and learning from learning

780
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,480
from our mistakes and

781
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
making sure that we put ourselves in a

782
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,480
environment that uh that is sustainable

783
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,919
and all that kind of stuff

784
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,559
so that what my first thought is

785
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,880
i think that all of this is applicable

786
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
to societal systems

787
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
but it doesn't necessarily mean that

788
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,919
any existing societal systems actually

789
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,760
perform functional

790
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,240
active inference

791
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,440
yeah

792
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
thanks it's almost like saying

793
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,320
uh

794
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
okay we're studying the penguins and

795
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,120
their thermostats and homeostats

796
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,320
this model could be parameterized to fit

797
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,440
a thriving or a failing society along

798
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
various different dimensions

799
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,679
and so in the sense that this is like a

800
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,080
linear aggression that can capture

801
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,399
failing as well as succeeding societies

802
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,279
yes the nested markov blanket formalism

803
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,760
has qualitatively but increasingly

804
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
quantitatively been applied and there's

805
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,720
multiple like startups and applications

806
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
that are explicitly pursuing this angle

807
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,519
it's been brought up for several years

808
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
now and um

809
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,039
in 2020 several of us wrote about it

810
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,440
being applied to remote teams and

811
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,799
organizations

812
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,360
and communities i can add these links to

813
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,519
decentralized science as a system and

814
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,600
ecosystem so

815
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,480
yes

816
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,159
people have started to sketch that

817
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,679
continent out

818
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,120
and there's a lot more to understand

819
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,360
what do you think lyle

820
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,080
yeah

821
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,159
i think that's that makes a ton of sense

822
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,720
i think uh obviously i guess the way i

823
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,039
was thinking about the question is

824
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,200
not so much whether

825
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
to what extent social systems do this

826
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,279
because social systems so you could take

827
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,519
two points of view one is you could say

828
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,120
social systems are behaving cognitively

829
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
in the ways

830
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
that we're

831
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,360
discussing

832
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,159
in other words they're

833
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,480
they're our preferred states that are

834
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,440
driving behavior now we could say

835
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
those preferred states are the wrong

836
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,399
states for whatever reasons

837
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,679
but

838
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,760
so so there's there's a question you

839
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,480
know between what we actually you know

840
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,360
as in any particular social system was

841
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,519
actually happening which i would argue

842
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,360
could be described through this

843
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
technique

844
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,279
or what they should be doing which we

845
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,960
could also describe through this

846
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,919
technique right so i think

847
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,360
i think it's important to have that

848
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,080
distinction and there's a really long

849
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,000
history of using dynamic systems models

850
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,320
to explore

851
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
those questions especially in the

852
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,039
business context so that's mostly how i

853
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,880
made my living through the

854
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,320
through the decades

855
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,600
so

856
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,640
though

857
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
that that you know sort of you know as

858
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,240
is to be or would prefer to be

859
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,480
sort of questioned it just seems like

860
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,600
this technique it would potentially be a

861
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,640
significant advance over the tools

862
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,320
in that space that currently exists

863
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
which are primarily

864
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,679
things like system dynamics and

865
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,760
agent-based modeling stuff like that

866
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,640
but this would seem to have the

867
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
potential to look at things as they are

868
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,919
why is it broken and what we might do

869
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,279
yes so

870
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,880
i've added several other

871
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,200
uh references it's important and the

872
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
book again is like

873
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
if it's describing the linear model then

874
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,320
there's the applications of a linear

875
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
model and

876
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,840
as people and as john brought up like

877
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
many times in this

878
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,519
uh series of live streams that we did

879
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
together with four with just the two of

880
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,279
us with john leading through

881
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
basically the entire thread of this

882
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,679
discussion of three papers and then two

883
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,279
more group discussions

884
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,880
there's been recent work on like scripts

885
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,360
by mao and colleagues

886
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
with a strong and a weak script

887
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,919
formalization like a strong script being

888
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,240
when the norms are practiced like in a

889
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
ritualistic way like reading from a

890
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,760
script versus the looser script concept

891
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,600
which could include just norms and

892
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,200
social praxis

893
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
and then more recently their modeling

894
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
work using pi mdp

895
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,320
to talk about epistemic communities

896
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,359
and then

897
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,679
some of the very earliest

898
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,679
live streams that we did were on

899
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
narrative human communication cultural

900
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,000
affordances

901
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,918
so these are absolutely topics that have

902
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,359
been addressed

903
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,119
although many of the earlier works are

904
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,879
like

905
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,199
here's people in the world

906
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,480
we're going to use active inference to

907
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
model it

908
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,239
but then

909
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,839
there's so much more

910
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
beyond that it's almost like a 1950s

911
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
cybernetics book

912
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
well we can just imagine that the person

913
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
is going to be involved in this feedback

914
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
loop

915
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,760
yeah but then that's not the the end of

916
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
the discussion on that um ali and then

917
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,040
john

918
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,200
uh i just wanted to mention that uh

919
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,560
well fep can potentially be

920
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,000
applied to any dynamical system with

921
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,480
ergodicity and uh because you see uh

922
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,400
in any system with the ergotic behavior

923
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,440
have uh some points of attraction some

924
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
attractors that

925
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,640
all the other states are converging to

926
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,760
so

927
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960
it's pretty general and well

928
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,000
almost uh all dynamical systems we know

929
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,680
of

930
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,760
on different time scales

931
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,079
can be potentially

932
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,680
modeled with fep and as its corollary

933
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,480
with active inference

934
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,079
thank you that's the key point right

935
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,680
because that's that's what we look at

936
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,079
there got to your god ethnicity tough

937
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,200
word for me

938
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,440
um and and you can actually look at that

939
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,640
even in the context of

940
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,560
businesses business strategy and so

941
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,440
forth with uh some understanding of the

942
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,359
absorbing barriers right

943
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,280
when when does a business dissipate when

944
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
it's not close enough to its preferred

945
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,000
state

946
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,760
like adequate cash flow so um yeah so

947
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,079
that i think that that just seems like a

948
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,920
really interesting progression from

949
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,560
where the state of the art of dynamic

950
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,119
non-linear dynamic systems is the way we

951
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,200
model businesses now

952
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,359
so well that's the way some of us do it

953
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,520
a lot of people use a spreadsheet but

954
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,280
um

955
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,520
this would just seem like a potentially

956
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,280
tremendous advantage

957
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
yeah and then just a few notes then john

958
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,400
um this stephen fox who's also joined on

959
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
and talked about industrial engineering

960
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
he's recently

961
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,920
had this paper come out just a couple

962
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,960
days ago

963
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,440
and ironically a spreadsheet is provided

964
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,359
in this paper but this is also in

965
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,000
practice in several places in the world

966
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,400
in startup ecosystems

967
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
and it's very active influenced and then

968
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,040
one other more conceptual note um cad

969
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,480
cad which is the complex systems

970
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
modeling software and i know some of you

971
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,880
are involved in cad cad learning as well

972
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
they describe it as a language for

973
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,079
encoding generalized dynamical systems

974
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,079
and that is what it is

975
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,400
active block friends is our

976
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,359
project where jacob has done much of the

977
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,000
initial work that is implementing active

978
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,640
inference in cad cad and we have a whole

979
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
litany of questions

980
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,240
about the relationships between base

981
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,599
graphs generalized dynamical systems

982
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,280
variational inference

983
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
cad cad which takes more of like a

984
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,800
sampling based approach

985
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,560
versus the variational approaches that

986
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,720
we're discussing here in active

987
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,680
and

988
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
it's going to be very interesting as

989
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,440
this

990
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,760
systems engineering complex systems

991
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,359
simulation

992
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,000
as well as tokenomic and other things

993
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,240
becomes integrated with this analytical

994
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,079
framework especially if we can

995
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,320
demonstrate a true concordance between

996
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,480
active inference and gds

997
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,079
john

998
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,240
uh lyle i just wanted to say your your

999
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
comments are really spot on earlier

1000
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,200
comments

1001
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,160
uh you had i think if i can paraphrase

1002
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,760
you had essentially said

1003
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
maybe even a dysfunctional society is

1004
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
performing active inference

1005
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
and then and then that would lead us to

1006
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,599
the

1007
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,400
really to the the key components then of

1008
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,200
that society or that social system is

1009
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,760
what is its set of preferred states and

1010
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,720
where is it placing its attention so if

1011
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,280
the if the if a uh say an elite group of

1012
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,839
very wealthy people or powerful people

1013
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,200
are running the world and they're

1014
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,680
running it for their preferences which

1015
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,400
is to maintain their wealth and to and

1016
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,079
to ensure that

1017
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,000
that they stay on top well then the

1018
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,560
world they could be performing

1019
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
functional active inference and the

1020
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,720
world could you know

1021
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,079
could uh

1022
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,200
could uh you know suffer the the

1023
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
problems that that kind of system would

1024
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,839
offer

1025
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,520
on the other hand if in a highly

1026
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,160
democratic system if people understand

1027
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,240
that they want clean air and clean water

1028
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,280
and peace and all that kind of stuff

1029
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
and then that's their set of preferred

1030
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,680
states and their attention is on that

1031
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
and they're performing active influence

1032
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,759
in

1033
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,800
thank you john

1034
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,599
um lyle and then mike

1035
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,680
i would just throw uh so john i'm

1036
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,040
completely

1037
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,680
on board with that i would i would just

1038
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
amplify a little bit on that i would say

1039
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,480
to a certain extent preferences

1040
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,839
and societal decisions are

1041
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,200
emergent

1042
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,760
so you you aren't going to find too many

1043
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,880
people in the world are going to say

1044
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,240
they want to be

1045
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,119
you know starving or have war whatever

1046
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,359
right and yet we do

1047
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,240
so

1048
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,400
the the interesting thing is how to me

1049
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,800
is how does the

1050
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,240
individual

1051
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,079
you know i mean this is the the whole

1052
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
build up right how does the individual

1053
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,319
behavior somehow

1054
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,599
uh

1055
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,040
you create an emergent system that has

1056
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,720
many bad outcomes

1057
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,119
even though potentially none of those

1058
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,880
are bad actors some of them are bad

1059
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,280
actors but let's just take the the the

1060
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,200
simple case there are no bad actors yet

1061
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,680
we get bad outcomes why is that

1062
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
and we can observe that in

1063
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
existing systems and then we can ask the

1064
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,599
question well

1065
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
you know why is that and then maybe if

1066
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,440
we understand why that is maybe we can

1067
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,640
do something

1068
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
to improve yes

1069
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
great

1070
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
um point and then just a short note

1071
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,240
there was in our remote teams

1072
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,480
we framed communication and information

1073
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
architectures as organizational

1074
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,400
affordances so

1075
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,160
that could assist with decision making

1076
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,839
find alignment where people do have

1077
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,359
similar preferences like a zone of

1078
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,359
proximate agreement in a negotiation

1079
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,480
context

1080
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,560
it might be broader but no matter how

1081
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,720
broad it is if you can't forage the path

1082
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,760
to it

1083
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,520
it's going to be a failing system

1084
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,839
mike

1085
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,319
yeah i just want to add i think scaling

1086
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,800
or the scale factor is

1087
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,880
hugely important here so

1088
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,040
uh if we're talking about interactions

1089
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,359
amongst a handful of individuals we're

1090
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,880
going to see different behaviors and

1091
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,319
outcomes than

1092
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,640
we might see on a global scale of

1093
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,920
cultural interaction

1094
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
okay and then the last comment on that

1095
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,560
john deal for it

1096
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,520
if your hand's still up i don't hear you

1097
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
actually okay

1098
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,839
your microphone may have changed or can

1099
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,319
other people hear john

1100
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,720
no okay um eric go for it

1101
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,880
yeah how does this all apply to a highly

1102
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,760
distributed system

1103
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,520
i don't see that

1104
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,400
yes

1105
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,520
like a society is

1106
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,200
good question the multi-agent case

1107
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,400
is something that hasn't been studied

1108
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,119
across the board but in 2021 with

1109
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,560
colleagues we

1110
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,680
made this is like one of the early

1111
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,280
it's not the first multi-agent

1112
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,480
simulation because there were

1113
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,640
multi-agent simulations however it was

1114
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,680
the first

1115
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,040
active inference model involving

1116
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,520
stigmergy which is the feedback process

1117
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,359
with agents modifying their environments

1118
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,680
and so on

1119
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,000
we can think about even a nested

1120
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,599
distributed

1121
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,760
cognitive system as

1122
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,400
inheriting some sparsity from a causal

1123
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,079
perspective like there's more

1124
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,319
connections in the base graph within the

1125
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,319
nestmate's head as we're modeling it and

1126
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,400
then interactions induce like a sparsity

1127
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
between two brains and then they're

1128
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
always coupled with the environment and

1129
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,800
so on

1130
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,920
and

1131
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,720
that sparsity is a statistical

1132
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
convenience but also it allows

1133
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,520
factorizability of models and

1134
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,400
the models may be factorized in a way

1135
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,520
where

1136
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,599
free energy calculations

1137
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,599
could be for example

1138
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,680
summed within a level of collective

1139
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,200
behavior

1140
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
i don't know if that's going it's not

1141
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,040
that's not the solution in and of itself

1142
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
to the modeling

1143
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,119
but when we have systems of like nested

1144
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,000
markov blankets

1145
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,800
in closing systems and closing systems

1146
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,599
and then also lateral interactions and

1147
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,160
interfaces like collective behavior

1148
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,480
those systems are at least amenable

1149
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,599
to this kind of principled composition

1150
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,440
via their sparsity

1151
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,119
which does map onto a causal

1152
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,800
architecture or at least a useful one of

1153
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
the real world

1154
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,040
so also remains to be seen

1155
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,880
but i think that's a very important

1156
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,720
question

1157
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,520
um

1158
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,880
lyle

1159
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
yeah i would throw it eric i would throw

1160
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,200
in on that that question because

1161
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,520
society of course broadly speaking is

1162
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,280
loosely coupled however of course there

1163
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,200
are clicks and densely coupled areas

1164
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,599
that are you know to create the well

1165
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,200
under well documented complex connection

1166
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,480
graphs right

1167
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,359
so that connection graph is emergent

1168
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,359
right so the question is i mean i think

1169
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,480
this would be actually a really

1170
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,240
fascinating research project

1171
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,680
can we show that fep would generate

1172
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,560
connection graphs or patterns the

1173
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,760
of

1174
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,839
societal interactions similar to what

1175
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,319
has been observed right so there's lots

1176
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,079
and lots of research on

1177
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,319
what those graphs look like

1178
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,920
so it is it possible for us to or

1179
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,760
someone to

1180
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,440
to

1181
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,720
use fep to show how those kind of

1182
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,400
connection patterns

1183
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,280
would

1184
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,960
emerge i think that's a really

1185
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
interesting question

1186
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,240
yes how we threshold

1187
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,200
and

1188
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,079
parameterize those causal graphs

1189
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,800
how we evaluate counterfactuals on those

1190
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,079
graphs

1191
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,520
and that's related to the problem of

1192
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,960
structure learning

1193
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,440
but bayesian model selection

1194
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,520
and other sort of hierarchical bayesian

1195
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,040
methods

1196
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,520
have the tools there

1197
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,079
also just quick pointer to the project

1198
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,359
ideas table

1199
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,240
there's some very interesting projects

1200
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,800
that people have suggested

1201
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,400
jakub no big deal

1202
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,040
sounds like a good one

1203
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,400
but we can absolutely do it and that's

1204
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,640
one of the advantages of being in like

1205
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,680
an active and activity driven

1206
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,240
participatory research and education

1207
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,359
space is we're hopefully going to be

1208
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,040
able to help each other

1209
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
identify those projects and where their

1210
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,040
hazard hasn't been overlap

1211
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,960
and then scaffold those projects support

1212
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,040
them and then provide them like a place

1213
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,520
to communicate about the project

1214
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,319
playing into the ontology active block

1215
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,599
for ins

1216
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,280
all these pieces that

1217
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
one researcher working by themselves

1218
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,480
would have

1219
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,319
just

1220
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,240
not those affordances

1221
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,839
let's just try to quickly look at the

1222
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,680
last several questions

1223
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
so

1224
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,240
um

1225
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,480
must all preferred states and strategies

1226
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,640
be ultimately linked to survival in some

1227
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,000
way or in the case of some organisms can

1228
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,520
free energy be related to something

1229
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,760
other than survival

1230
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,560
so

1231
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,400
just a quick thought on that in the

1232
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,599
context of repeated measurements

1233
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,800
yes

1234
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,359
survival is the capacity for repeated

1235
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,680
measurements

1236
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,760
free energies for

1237
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,960
domain specific models can be made that

1238
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,040
have nothing to do with survival

1239
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,800
and i don't think that there's any

1240
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,119
contradiction there

1241
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,359
john

1242
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,079
i still don't hear you actually

1243
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,480
uh rohan and then anyone else who raises

1244
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,880
their hand

1245
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,960
yeah hi

1246
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,839
uh so i was actually wondering because

1247
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,880
uh

1248
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,040
there's no treatment of time in any of

1249
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,520
these uh methods right

1250
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,200
so i

1251
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,000
so

1252
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,839
like is there any

1253
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,559
accommodation made so if you're sampling

1254
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,760
something

1255
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,520
let's say you sample at a minute

1256
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,640
frequency

1257
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,960
you're getting a certain set of events

1258
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,559
whereas if you're sampling at a much

1259
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,880
higher frequency you would get a very

1260
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,200
different much more noisy

1261
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,359
data set but that might be essential to

1262
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,920
capture certain things that might

1263
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,079
actually enable survival maybe there's

1264
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,640
certain events that act only at certain

1265
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,920
times

1266
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,440
so uh

1267
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,680
from the perspective of

1268
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,240
repeated measurement right so i think

1269
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,640
free energy principle as it relates to

1270
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,000
survival

1271
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,720
uh could it just be related to some sort

1272
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,240
of

1273
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,880
creating an internal clock

1274
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,200
for repeated measurement

1275
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,599
great question

1276
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,040
yes so far it's been almost

1277
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,400
time independent as you suggest

1278
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,119
but

1279
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,440
we're going to be dealing with two

1280
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,839
ways to deal with time in chapter four

1281
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,000
and beyond and that's like a discrete

1282
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,520
time formalization

1283
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,599
where future and past states are

1284
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,160
explicitly modeled partially observable

1285
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,640
markov decision process

1286
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,280
and then also a continuous time variance

1287
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,480
where future and past time points are

1288
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,680
not explicitly modeled however a taylor

1289
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,520
series approximation

1290
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,599
higher and higher derivatives of a

1291
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,160
function are utilized to glean an

1292
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,800
approximation to the future behavior of

1293
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,359
a function those are two different ways

1294
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,920
of dealing with time and then you talked

1295
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,160
about like sampling rate

1296
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,520
and

1297
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,119
i think uh

1298
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,680
you'll see many connections

1299
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
and ways to apply that

1300
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,280
for example you could imagine like if

1301
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,920
the sensor is every seconds but you're

1302
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,400
able to think 10 times per seconds

1303
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
or what about when the sensor is every

1304
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,319
10 seconds but you're only able to think

1305
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,920
over this time scale

1306
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
and it's those kinds of situations where

1307
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,920
actually the frequencies are happening

1308
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,960
differently

1309
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,200
that we also might be able to address

1310
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,520
yes rohan

1311
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,079
uh yeah yeah also like if there are

1312
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,040
multiple sensors some of them react

1313
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,760
quickly some of them react slowly or if

1314
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,800
there's just

1315
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,079
uh

1316
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,839
or if we look at active inference as

1317
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:36,960
some sort of

1318
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,839
model averaging phenomena right so you

1319
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,400
have a model that runs really fast

1320
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,319
that reacts really quickly and produces

1321
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,000
predictions really quickly

1322
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,240
and the other one

1323
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,359
uh

1324
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,359
acts more slowly

1325
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,880
would those be

1326
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,960
valid targets in

1327
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,000
in any sense

1328
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,240
yes i think it's a very um interesting

1329
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,839
question i'll just add it here just

1330
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,280
because it was where we were discussing

1331
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,640
it um

1332
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,800
like about different time scales

1333
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,400
and the way that

1334
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,880
cognitive clock rates for example and

1335
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,400
sensory clock rates and then the time

1336
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,760
scale events the statistical

1337
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,240
regularities in the world happen

1338
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,839
um

1339
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,720
in model stream 4.1 with

1340
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,880
devry's and colleagues

1341
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,640
they talked about the message passing in

1342
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,520
a factor graph so

1343
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,880
any time that there's a base graph

1344
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,040
there's a way to accomplish variational

1345
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,960
inference on that base graph using

1346
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,599
message passing techniques

1347
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,599
that's what their package is about

1348
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,040
forney lab

1349
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,280
and then what they hinted at towards the

1350
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,359
end is actually this reactive message

1351
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,200
passing

1352
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,040
development which uses reactive

1353
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,520
programming techniques so whereas in

1354
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,760
message passing at least in the forney

1355
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,559
factor graph formalization it's like you

1356
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,800
crank the model and a message is passed

1357
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,160
amongst every node or there's like a

1358
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,559
given execution order of messages that

1359
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,800
are passed for the entire graph

1360
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,040
however the reactive

1361
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,960
message passing paradigm

1362
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,599
may allow like

1363
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,319
uncoupling of the frequency of message

1364
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,359
passing

1365
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,200
so you might have one prior that gets

1366
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,800
one message per hour and then there's

1367
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,559
another distribution that gets one

1368
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,319
message per minute and another one is

1369
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,839
getting one per second

1370
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,280
and even that one could be doing model

1371
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,359
averaging of something much faster

1372
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,359
so there's there's many ways that i

1373
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,800
think your questions will be starting to

1374
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,640
be explored rohan and then john

1375
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,520
okay john if you're like

1376
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,640
can you hear me now oh good

1377
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,640
on the question of survival i think you

1378
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,800
would have to identify to answer it

1379
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
you'd have to identify first what is the

1380
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,880
organism or what is the agent that

1381
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,200
you're talking about because obviously

1382
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,079
as if it's an individual person a person

1383
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,640
might uh sacrifice their life for others

1384
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,599
so then you know survival is not the

1385
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,200
main necessarily the main uh

1386
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,240
driver

1387
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,280
but if it's a society

1388
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,079
then

1389
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,079
you know that's a

1390
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,640
that any individual might not survive

1391
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,280
but society as a whole might i suspect

1392
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,079
in the bigger picture that it's not

1393
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,480
it's not really survival of a species

1394
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,760
it's probably

1395
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,319
the ability to um

1396
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,720
the propagation of information somehow

1397
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,400
that's what i would guess in the in the

1398
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,319
biggest picture

1399
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,400
that's probably what everything is doing

1400
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,040
is propagating information

1401
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,440
and mike levin has also explored like

1402
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,040
how changes in the scope of the self

1403
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,119
can lead to like an organism with

1404
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,280
reduced fitness as a function of a

1405
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,760
cancer with increased fitness and

1406
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,800
vision so to speak and so like just

1407
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,400
because there's an imperative or

1408
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,280
normative way that we model behavior

1409
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
doesn't mean that everything works or

1410
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,920
anything like that

1411
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,280
yes

1412
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,599
ali

1413
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,119
yes adding to what john said well

1414
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,119
yes again i believe here survival

1415
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,440
doesn't necessarily mean

1416
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,400
biological survival and

1417
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,880
actually it means it it has a much

1418
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,800
broader sense

1419
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,640
and uh it means

1420
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,680
uh

1421
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,000
the existence of things actually it's a

1422
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,160
metaphysical concept here because um

1423
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,920
as i said

1424
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,480
carl priston has

1425
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,880
defined the existence or the the the

1426
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,190
requisites of

1427
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,680
[Music]

1428
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,319
the prerequisites of existence as uh

1429
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,400
having two uh parameters or two features

1430
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,760
uh namely uh being an ergotic system and

1431
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,359
having markup blankets so any system uh

1432
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,559
which has

1433
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,400
these any system which has these two

1434
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,440
properties can basically be considered

1435
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,559
uh as an existence system or

1436
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,119
we can call it a surviving system here

1437
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,680
just to in our last minutes before we go

1438
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,599
to tools

1439
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,760
touch on some of these points can markup

1440
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,359
blanket be considered a decoupling

1441
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,400
mechanism

1442
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,480
so can anything mathematical be

1443
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,440
considered a mechanism

1444
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,280
people use terms in different ways so

1445
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,599
just to raise the point that like a

1446
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,040
linear aggression on height and weight

1447
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
isn't a mechanism of height and weight

1448
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,359
it's just a descriptor so markov blanket

1449
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,960
doesn't need to be any kind of mechanism

1450
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,200
at all it doesn't need to cut nature at

1451
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,960
the joints or anything like that that

1452
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,119
being said there are ways in which one

1453
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,799
could think of the blanket again

1454
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,640
variously depending on how the real

1455
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,839
generative model and generative process

1456
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,599
separated as part of a markov partition

1457
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,520
sometimes there's ways to think of it as

1458
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,200
how they're coupled

1459
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,440
other times it is a statistical

1460
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,760
decoupling of a type

1461
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,079
it's a partial information encapsulation

1462
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,319
but it's not a total encapsulation

1463
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,880
and that way it is like an interface and

1464
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,520
yes thanks to whomever has added this

1465
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,400
quote

1466
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,280
um

1467
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,359
this is one reason why the transcripts

1468
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,720
of all of the live streams and

1469
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,440
discussions augmented with the ontology

1470
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,000
will be so helpful and searchable

1471
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,440
because we could find sentences that

1472
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,599
have raised similar points

1473
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,799
and addressed them so good question

1474
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,599
and then just last ones

1475
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,359
um

1476
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,280
maybe we can come back

1477
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,599
to this

1478
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,040
and then um

1479
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,839
this one is a a nice next step

1480
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,440
question thinking about friction what is

1481
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,599
the analogy to friction in a cognitive

1482
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,799
system

1483
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,319
what is what is the stochastic

1484
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,920
fluctuation

1485
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,160
on our cognitive path of least action

1486
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,880
what is that in the real world realism

1487
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,640
ontological claims

1488
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,680
and then

1489
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,319
from the behavioral modeling perspective

1490
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,200
where are we using these equations

1491
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,480
and

1492
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,319
partitioning variants

1493
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,280
into

1494
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,160
a path or a flow of least action

1495
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,079
and a variable that is analogous to

1496
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,880
stochastic fluctuation or friction

1497
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,520
but doesn't take on any of the baggage

1498
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,079
of describing some feature or component

1499
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,359
or mechanism of the physical system

1500
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,280
so also a great question though and

1501
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,640
we'll leave this one in case people want

1502
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,720
to continue to address it

1503
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,920
so

1504
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,240
that brings us to the end of chapter

1505
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,720
three live meetings

1506
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,640
next week we'll head into two weeks of

1507
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,079
chapter four

1508
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,400
then two weeks of chapter five

1509
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,079
and then we'll have two weeks to sort of

1510
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,079
ground ourselves think about what we've

1511
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,119
learned talk about project ideas and

1512
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,599
then we'll be heading into the second

1513
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,440
cohort of the first half of the book

1514
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,119
and for those who are here who want to

1515
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,240
continue

1516
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,200
into

1517
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,240
the the back nine as it were the second

1518
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,799
half of the textbook

1519
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,640
and also people are welcomed and

1520
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,960
encouraged to be facilitators or return

1521
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,920
participants in the second cohort first

1522
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,480
part because it's many coats of paint

1523
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,640
for everyone and so we want to provide

1524
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,240
that affordance to return again and

1525
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,440
again and again

1526
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,520
because the basics are the classics and

1527
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,000
the essence and the seed of innovation

1528
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,839
all this other important things that

1529
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,799
happen when we return and clarify

1530
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,680
also we've had to sort of do all of

1531
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,079
these entering the figures and equations

1532
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,599
for the first time

1533
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,760
but now that we have the architecture

1534
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,240
people can focus on annotating them or

1535
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,480
they can focus on adding new questions

1536
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,160
or improving the questions that others

1537
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,480
have written

1538
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,599
if anyone else has any comments that

1539
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,119
they want to

1540
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,400
make while the recording is still

1541
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,160
occurring i'll just give a few seconds

1542
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,720
for anyone to raise their hand

1543
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,400
um and then we'll end this session

1544
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,480
and then take a one minute break and

1545
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,960
then in this room we'll be continuing on

1546
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,760
with tools organizational unit

1547
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,079
and um if you want to continue speaking

1548
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,319
with people here about just any topic at

1549
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,640
all you can head up to a room up top and

1550
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,480
then of course always you can join into

1551
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,200
the discord voice channels and just be

1552
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,040
working on things like during the math

1553
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,440
reading group or any other area rohan

1554
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,640
and then anyone else who raises their

1555
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,640
hand

1556
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,040
yeah so i actually so sorry for this

1557
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,359
late thought so i i'm just curious is so

1558
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,760
when you say the free energy principle

1559
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
it's basically figuring out some

1560
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,200
set point of states internal states that

1561
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,520
you that the agent wants to be with

1562
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,680
right it's not necessary that

1563
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,000
it actually couples to the real world so

1564
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,480
why wouldn't it be that

1565
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
okay it just becomes a brain in the vat

1566
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,280
type of situation

1567
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,400
so it does so it just find needs to find

1568
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,000
the set point that helps it survive

1569
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,040
so

1570
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,960
it doesn't have to actually model the

1571
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,040
real world it just has to find a place

1572
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,920
and

1573
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,920
no matter what happens just stay there

1574
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,960
so it's not

1575
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,160
really dynamic it is that could be

1576
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,119
is that a possibility

1577
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,599
it is dynamic it is explicitly modeling

1578
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,839
time and one can make a model just like

1579
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,920
a linear regression could be static or

1580
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,760
you could use the linear

1581
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,720
regression technique and use it in

1582
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,440
i was i was more referring it uh so uh

1583
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,280
if you look at some of the reinforcement

1584
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,040
deep reinforcement learning models right

1585
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
they usually find some trick within the

1586
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,119
game like if you're looking at atari

1587
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,119
games and you say maximize the score for

1588
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,559
example

1589
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,480
so it tries to find

1590
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,240
uh you know okay i can maximize the

1591
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,920
score by doing the simplest thing that

1592
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,319
doesn't require me to progress in any

1593
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,200
way

1594
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,000
but

1595
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,720
it would increase the score

1596
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,680
okay

1597
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,359
so um

1598
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,119
yes these are important things so write

1599
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,280
them down so that we can have infinite

1600
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,359
discourse on them

1601
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,240
um

1602
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,160
the brain the vat does still have an

1603
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,760
interface with the environment whether

1604
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,319
it's receive only and then you brought

1605
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,440
up like it doesn't have to be like

1606
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,599
modeling the quote real world

1607
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,920
this is the architecture that helps us

1608
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,359
bypass

1609
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,160
that

1610
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,040
and say right the particulate states the

1611
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,680
particular states which are the blanket

1612
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,760
states and the internal states

1613
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,680
are doing inference acting as if they're

1614
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,559
doing inference on external states

1615
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,559
so it's perfectly compatible with

1616
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,359
scientific realism scientific surrealism

1617
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,119
aesthetic surrealism

1618
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,319
you could but so i mean the states could

1619
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,400
be hallucinating

1620
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,240
it could be hallucinating the world and

1621
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,680
it's actually just

1622
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,280
doing inference on the hallucination

1623
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,720
rather than

1624
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,720
actual reality as such

1625
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,200
anil seth and many others who speak of

1626
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,040
that uh reality as a controlled

1627
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,520
hallucination they're they're two feet

1628
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,880
in that territory without any qualms

1629
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,400
and feeling like it addresses questions

1630
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,520
that have been unaddressed by other

1631
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,160
perspectives

1632
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,960
okay okay yeah okay so i'll just put

1633
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,040
this down yep cool

1634
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,839
thank you everybody
