1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,290
Okay, it is May 19,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,698
2022 and it's week three of the textbook

3
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:12,640
group first cohort. We're in week three

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,280
discussing appendix A and B and

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,958
there are some notes in the sections of

6
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,926
the book. In the chapters. There are

7
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:27,974
also some ideas and questions that

8
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:32,134
people have raised. So we'll go

9
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:34,358
to the questions and then start with the

10
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,134
most upvoted. So feel free to add more

11
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:39,658
upvotes if you want to

12
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,314
discuss it, like even in this

13
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:45,770
discussion. And then hopefully

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,842
if people are available to take notes in

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,966
this section, that will help add their

16
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,374
thoughts in and also capture what the

17
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:56,286
speakers are saying. And then we'll look

18
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,630
at the question and then try to

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,774
come to different answers and just add

20
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,950
more information that people can add

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,680
more structure to later.

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,866
Okay, the first question says appendix A

23
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,206
is described as the mathematical

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,070
background. So maybe question

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,886
one for the authors or for you. What is

26
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,294
the process of determining what is

27
00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:22,774
figuring ground for the formalisms of

28
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:23,670
active?

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,228
What other math concepts and formalisms

30
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:31,236
are important for learning and applying

31
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:33,816
active inference? And then three, what

32
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:36,840
are some resources and approaches for

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,216
learning math that help us learn what is

34
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:41,880
useful for active inference?

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,084
Anyone can raise their hand or we can

36
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:12,270
just start to add some annotations here,

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,964
like what should be included in the

38
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,864
primary regime of attention with a

39
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:21,276
reading of a book, either linearly,

40
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,288
like some books are, or in a maybe

41
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:27,216
moving around the sections. So what

42
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:30,404
should be in the chapters? What should

43
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,148
be in the appendix? What is not in the

44
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:32,900
appendix?

45
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,766
What did people expect would be in the

46
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:41,790
chapter in the appendix? Not covered.

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,280
Yeah, Jessica and then anyone else?

48
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,366
Yeah, I was wondering about the

49
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:16,094
multiplication of the matrices that we

50
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:19,710
covered yesterday. Which equations

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,430
have the multiplication of the matrices?

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,122
A couple of examples just so I can play

53
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,420
around with them.

54
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,986
In the actual active inference

55
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:36,790
equations.

56
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,180
Does anyone know? One,

57
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,166
this is referencing the way that the

58
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:50,066
appendix A is starting with linear

59
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,102
algebra and then introducing this

60
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:58,482
operation of multiplying two matrices.

61
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:02,006
Or to get a product if someone can

62
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,954
find like an equation that we already

63
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,490
seen or some other equation while I'm

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,786
typing up that question, that would be

65
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,410
helpful.

66
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,094
Could anyone just describe what they

67
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:21,422
thought the intention was of starting

68
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:24,386
with linear algebra and using 8.1 as the

69
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,734
first equation of the appendix? Or we'll

70
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,058
return to just the more general

71
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:29,780
questions.

72
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,644
Yeah, I mean, learning our algebra is

73
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:45,780
kind of the most discreet.

74
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,784
I don't. Want to say fundamental, but

75
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:53,916
like practical and comprehensive way of

76
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:57,852
kind of working with a large space of

77
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:01,772
data, I guess, together and

78
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:04,460
computing on it. So it's kind of the

79
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,360
basis for the discrete parts

80
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,556
and maybe easier than the nondiscrete

81
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:26,570
parts. Good reason it started.

82
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,038
I guess if the question was where

83
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:46,246
is linear algebra used in the active

84
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,290
inference math?

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,740
When you go to appendix b.

86
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,646
Then you've got the equations of active

87
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:59,534
inference and these are all expressed in

88
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:03,246
terms of large vector spaces of

89
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:05,246
variables, so probability of

90
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:08,222
distributions. And so for example, on

91
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,342
page 245, you've got this dot notation

92
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,658
which is the expectation of a value.

93
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:18,530
So that goes directly back to

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,786
that first section of appendix A is what

95
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,738
does that mean in terms of how do you

96
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:25,446
take an expectation of a large vector of

97
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:26,966
things? How do you express that

98
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,990
compactly?

99
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,006
Thanks. Could you unpack we looked at

100
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:38,330
the dot notation a little bit yesterday

101
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,442
and they were mentioning how

102
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:43,978
well, I think it was actually one of the

103
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:45,322
questions too. Let's just see if someone

104
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,740
asks this, okay?

105
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,414
They say the dot operator in a

106
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:56,602
three, the dot operator

107
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:58,266
is equivalent to standard matrix

108
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,830
multiplication where the first matrix

109
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,986
has been transposed. So what is the

110
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,970
relationship with expectation?

111
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,786
How does expectation for anyone, how

112
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,866
does expectation relate to linear

113
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:13,750
algebra?

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,324
Yeah, expectation is the probability of

115
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:32,444
a value, the average probability of some

116
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,764
value. So you're going to take all the

117
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,808
possible values and you're going to

118
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:39,280
multiply them by the probability of that

119
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,896
value and then divide by the sum of the

120
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,216
probability of normal is to one. So that

121
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,536
will be the expectation. So if you have

122
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:50,496
a whole array or a vector in your

123
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:53,156
distribution, you can express that all

124
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:55,764
in compact notation by saying with this

125
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,844
simple way of saying we're going to take

126
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,268
every one of these terms and we're going

127
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:01,396
to multiply it by the probability of

128
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:05,076
that term and the probability is

129
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:07,656
some to one. So then that will be your

130
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,400
average overall.

131
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,550
Awesome, thanks for that answer.

132
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,724
Okay, thanks for that awesome answer.

133
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:24,892
Does anyone have any other thoughts on

134
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:27,228
just this first question and then we'll

135
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:31,232
continue. So what is

136
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:33,996
figuring ground? We're learning active

137
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:36,016
inference in the chapters. That's why

138
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:38,176
the chapters are there. The appendix is

139
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:41,600
there to somehow lightly supplement

140
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,356
that. Like they describe it as an

141
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,976
introduction or a refresher to the basic

142
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:51,844
mathematical techniques. And linear

143
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:56,136
algebra is the first section, a two

144
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:58,680
that is discussing a lot of important

145
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,816
things like derivatives and

146
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:03,076
Probabilities taylor series variational

147
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:04,988
calculus and Stochastic dynamics are

148
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,240
going to come in in the coming chapters,

149
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,556
but the linear algebra is important for

150
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:12,380
the upcoming chapters.

151
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,832
Okay, so this question asked in

152
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,730
a three.

153
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,484
They say the dot operator is equivalent

154
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:31,396
to standard matrix multiplication where

155
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:33,696
the first matrix has been transposed,

156
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:36,064
which is flipped like it's the operation

157
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:38,260
in Google Sheets or Excel right click

158
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,028
paste transpose. They say that in the

159
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,796
case of column matrices, this is

160
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,136
equivalent to the dot product. So the

161
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:47,496
dot operator here is like a

162
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:49,444
generalization of the vector dot

163
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:51,656
operator, the sum of the products of the

164
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,064
corresponding entries of the two

165
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:56,300
sequences of numbers. So the questions

166
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,320
here were what is interpretation,

167
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,756
implication or use of a dot product of

168
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:04,156
vectors? And then what is an

169
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,328
interpretation, implication or use of a

170
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,272
more generalized dot product. And there

171
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,290
looks like there's an awesome answer.

172
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,946
What would be a situation where if

173
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:57,906
anyone can think of one, like the Dot

174
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:59,350
product would be applied.

175
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,014
We're trying to do this in this

176
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:06,346
situation. This is the operation that we

177
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:09,834
needed. We wanted to compute matrix A on

178
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:13,338
something of something. We used

179
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:14,780
B dot C.

180
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,714
Continue eric's description from

181
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:28,586
the probability like you have

182
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:32,602
expectation probability and you wanted

183
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:38,142
to kind of see the error or whatever

184
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,622
the difference, I guess between

185
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:44,030
observation and the expectation,

186
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,154
then a Dot product would give you that

187
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:58,728
answer or it's

188
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,670
a probability density of it.

189
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,554
What are some ways to compute

190
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:13,354
differences? Like if

191
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,234
there are scalars you can subtract like

192
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:20,158
five minus three or something, then it

193
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:23,150
was mentioned of cosine similarity.

194
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,510
Does anyone think of or imagine another

195
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,726
way that you could compute the

196
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,366
difference between two different kinds

197
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:34,562
of features of

198
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:35,730
different dimensions.

199
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,110
Like another example is divergence

200
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,466
because that's like measuring the

201
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:49,602
differences between these two

202
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,314
distributions and there's different

203
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,540
divergences. The KL is one of them.

204
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,834
What other things are in this space that

205
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:59,766
might be just tractable possible

206
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:01,190
distance measures?

207
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,602
Well, these are the same dimensionality

208
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,514
in all these cases. But another very

209
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,046
popular one is the sum squared

210
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,610
difference, sum squared error.

211
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,850
And then you can have absolute different

212
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,294
value difference. So these are called

213
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,190
different norms.

214
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,480
I think that's the right word. Yes.

215
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,362
There's also the Ginny index, the Jacard

216
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:36,478
index, euclidean distances

217
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,530
like sample to sample distances.

218
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,794
So could anyone talk

219
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:14,898
about L zero, l one and L two, et cetera

220
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:18,150
norms? While I'm adding some links.

221
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,700
If I have the right numbers here l two

222
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,288
norm would be the square root of the sum

223
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:42,430
of squares. L one norm would be the

224
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,400
average of the absolute absolute value

225
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,456
differences and L zero. I don't know

226
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:52,528
what that is. I don't think it's a

227
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,892
difference, is it? It's like a presence

228
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,430
absence. Okay.

229
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,436
That kind of encoding is used in a lot

230
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:07,876
of different algorithms and

231
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,776
then the L two norm is the sum of

232
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:13,784
squares. So the L two norm is what is

233
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:15,316
used like in at least squares

234
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:18,740
regression, classical statistics,

235
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,556
ttest inova that's a

236
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:25,630
lot driven by the L two norm.

237
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,020
And all of that is like in the

238
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,528
genre of what the A three notation is

239
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:36,400
describing.

240
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,992
But depending on what the B and the C

241
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:42,956
are and what the A is, et cetera,

242
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,464
there's just the dimensions of

243
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,544
everything and other operations that are

244
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,310
happening before or after it.

245
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,410
Later on they mentioned the quadratic,

246
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,226
which is the L two norm. So that's where

247
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,458
you have the same term as multiplied by

248
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,654
itself. Or if you have cross terms,

249
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,510
then you get the covariance.

250
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,456
And that's going to be used later with

251
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,680
the LaPlace approximation and other

252
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,440
approximation techniques.

253
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,856
Any other comments on a three or dot

254
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:26,076
product? Or just like this kind of

255
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:28,780
linear algebra topic?

256
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,300
Linear algebra the basics,

257
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,764
the trace and the determinant, which are

258
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,376
probably less important than the dot

259
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:51,770
product but still come into play,

260
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,936
the derivatives, how things change with

261
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,920
respect to each other, possibly time,

262
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,840
possibly some other surface,

263
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
and then probabilities.

264
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,376
So does anyone have any other comments

265
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:12,780
or thoughts on that whole section? Like

266
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,364
anything that they read or like had

267
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:17,170
uncertainty around up to equation A 22?

268
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,028
Great. That no one has uncertainty

269
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:35,010
around any of the equations up to A 22?

270
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,796
Yeah, obviously there is a

271
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:44,448
lot to learn and to understand and we're

272
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:45,590
not going to.

273
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,228
It's just I don't know people who want

274
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,728
to think about that. Like, what are we

275
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:54,404
learning in Appendix A? Why is appendix

276
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:55,210
A there?

277
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,080
Hopefully we can start to understand

278
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,210
some of this in Math Learning Group.

279
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,476
The people who want to be really engaged

280
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:06,910
with the math questioning and process

281
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,412
and also connecting it to computer

282
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,876
science into the applications has been

283
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,308
happening and then hopefully everyone

284
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:17,856
can benefit from this, like finding the

285
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:20,624
resources and stuff. Because the

286
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,064
relationships between the terms,

287
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:25,072
relationships amongst the terms are

288
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,440
driven by formalisms.

289
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,644
Like the way that preferences and

290
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,448
expectations are framed in active

291
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,140
inference is related to equations,

292
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,820
not only a conceptual linkage.

293
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,616
Maybe here we can just write Math

294
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,816
Learning Group and copy this to the

295
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:55,800
resources.

296
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,196
Okay, so what kinds

297
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:05,796
of examples do you think would be useful

298
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,576
for learning the equations and concepts

299
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,364
in Appendix A? If the equations felt too

300
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:13,468
general and not applying to anything in

301
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:17,496
particular, what example or scenario

302
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:20,948
or would have made sense or you felt

303
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,640
would have made that clearer?

304
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,192
Like, we're running a business and first

305
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,416
this person wants to do this and then

306
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,752
this person wants to do that? Or what

307
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,532
example or what would somebody have

308
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,484
expected to have found or wanted to have

309
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:40,670
found that would have made it clear?

310
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:51,264
Examples or other exercises or

311
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:53,084
a format? This is kind of like a math

312
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,044
lecture. It's kind of directional versus

313
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:57,792
like, what other things could happen

314
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,104
where you would feel like you were

315
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:00,276
understanding and learning this and

316
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:02,788
engaging with it. Yes. Thanks, Brock. I

317
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,284
was kind of reminded of a video that

318
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:11,044
Karl A presentation where

319
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:15,000
he in real time demonstrates

320
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,992
and helps you work

321
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,776
through a pattern of red. Like it's like

322
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,892
three dots sort of that are moving

323
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:28,110
around red, green and pattern. And so

324
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,824
understanding just a simple visual

325
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:36,740
example of how active inference

326
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,312
would work that

327
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:45,068
doesn't require

328
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:49,410
the formalism to just

329
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,584
surface level kind of pattern

330
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:54,592
recognized, that would be like ideal

331
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:57,636
maybe of then bringing in the math for

332
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:00,564
this part and that part and some

333
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:09,168
scaffolding. But yeah,

334
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm not sure the appendix, I'm not sure

335
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,896
it was meant to be bred in. I'm not sure

336
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,116
there's a great way to read one order or

337
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:21,124
another there because you kind of need

338
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:25,568
it, but you kind of it's

339
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:28,950
a lot too, right? Yeah,

340
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,412
great point. And the organizing

341
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:36,184
team for the textbook group which was

342
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,580
open to everybody who wanted to join the

343
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,464
and the comms weekly meetings. So for

344
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:43,644
future cohorts, people could totally be

345
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:45,132
involved with planning it,

346
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:47,644
communicating it, doing anything for

347
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:50,572
future cohorts as a co organizer or

348
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:53,964
other role. But we talked a lot about

349
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:57,280
the reading order. Would it make sense

350
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,890
to read them in without

351
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,968
appendix or putting the appendix last or

352
00:23:06,054 --> 00:23:09,604
somewhere else? One was

353
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:12,388
short and hopefully the one week of

354
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,516
regime of attention on appendix A and B

355
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:17,476
is like we're just skimming it in a

356
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:20,856
week. We're not getting a

357
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:23,784
PhD in math, we're not generating these

358
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:26,024
equations on a blank piece of paper.

359
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:29,672
We're just like seeing the forms that

360
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:32,648
will be used and then some of the key

361
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:35,192
areas in the order that the authors

362
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:37,192
thought that those background topics

363
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:39,950
were important. So like for appendix A,

364
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,084
linear algebra, which is what we talked

365
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,748
the most about, because it's going to

366
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:47,710
come into play most quickly,

367
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,040
especially with these notions of

368
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,544
expectation and differences which is

369
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,168
going to come into play with everything

370
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:58,180
that's going to happen. Taylor series

371
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,896
variational calculus and Stochastic

372
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:04,772
dynamics we talked less about.

373
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:06,484
They happened in a later order within

374
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:08,916
the appendix, but hopefully there will

375
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:11,192
still be many questions on them because

376
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:13,624
they're probably also areas with a lot

377
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,264
to learn and to clarify. And also

378
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:18,840
appendix A is like not the final

379
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,280
resource of it diffusing into us. Like

380
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,932
something that was really important that

381
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:26,492
came up in the math learning group. Is

382
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:29,176
there's not like a glossary of variables

383
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,088
or table of variables so that's

384
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,308
something we can work on with notation

385
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:37,676
is connecting the variables to natural

386
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,330
language ontology terms and then also

387
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,928
things like this what do we even look up

388
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:47,776
or a symbol or what does it mean when

389
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,808
there's a double arrow? There's a lot of

390
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,956
things that like a lot of dots that

391
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:55,252
could be connected if people ask them

392
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,456
and then we can probably get a response

393
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:59,556
like what was the double arrow in a

394
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,928
three? Does it mean anything that

395
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:05,016
they're offset? Or what are the parts of

396
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,056
this shape that are mattering for the

397
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:09,876
background of learning? Active

398
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,524
inference, anyone can ask like any

399
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:14,556
question. If it's coming to mind as an

400
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:17,404
uncertainty, then writing it down just

401
00:25:17,442 --> 00:25:20,908
anywhere is really helpful. Because then

402
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:23,852
on the first pass through learning or a

403
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:26,352
primary branch of learning, we can just

404
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:29,570
go, okay, here's what a one shows,

405
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,372
and then have that in a way that reduces

406
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:36,448
uncertainty more rapidly than how any of

407
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,144
us would just give an ad hoc

408
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:39,060
explanation.

409
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,884
Moritz wrote one thing that I

410
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,140
always find useful in thinking about

411
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,288
matrix, linear algebra matrices is to

412
00:25:54,314 --> 00:25:56,216
write out pictures of the matrices in

413
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,056
their dimensions because often the

414
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,876
notation, you've got these I's and J's

415
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,688
and K's and stuff going around, but you

416
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,276
don't know how that maps out into the

417
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,604
actual elements of the matrix. So those

418
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:08,910
illustrations are always helpful that

419
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,088
could be added into this book. They're

420
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,950
in a few places, but not that much.

421
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,990
There you go. Things like that.

422
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,776
Yeah. And also connecting the

423
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,424
programming experience that people might

424
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:27,260
have even in no code tools like Excel

425
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,940
Google Sheet, you have rows and columns,

426
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,464
ones have numbers and ones have letters,

427
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:35,092
but they can be other things. And then

428
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,432
anyone who's used something like Python

429
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:42,236
or R or even just doing some statistical

430
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:44,628
calculations, like if you put two lists

431
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,176
of numbers into the t test, that would

432
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:49,448
be vector versus vector something, and

433
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,476
then you would address the fifth element

434
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,624
of the list. And then if it was in

435
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,484
Excel, you would need to address two

436
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,868
numbers to say where you were in the

437
00:26:57,874 --> 00:27:00,044
matrix. And then the tensor is just any

438
00:27:00,082 --> 00:27:02,856
number of more than three dimensions,

439
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:04,956
which is sometimes like it's like, oh,

440
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:06,256
but how spatially are we going to see

441
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:08,112
it? But then we're familiar with working

442
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:11,248
with spreadsheets and data sets that are

443
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:13,776
larger than two by two or larger than

444
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,720
two dimensions,

445
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,430
and that will come into play a lot.

446
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,256
And the numbers can be representing

447
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:23,636
probabilities or be used for

448
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:27,684
probabilities. I also

449
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:31,032
Daniel in the chat shared a link to a

450
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:35,048
Python notebook that is a link, and it

451
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:36,648
shows kind of the operations on

452
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:40,824
matrices. And you can see both the

453
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:44,028
mathematical yeah, there you go. So you

454
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:45,836
can see the actual matrix and you can

455
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:48,364
actually run code too, there. So that

456
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:51,788
particular awesome. So I pasted the

457
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:55,136
link in here and then we can

458
00:27:55,158 --> 00:27:57,680
fill out the rest of the row.

459
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:05,802
But then someone

460
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,570
could be looking for a guide on matrix

461
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,222
or programming and matrix or something

462
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,662
before this state. So then each person,

463
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:17,166
if they find it and add it here, will

464
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:19,760
have a lot to share and learn.

465
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,976
Okay, does anybody want to like, if they

466
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,010
were the one who asked it this question,

467
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,910
I i think it's probably referring to

468
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,070
long equations that that probably none

469
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,058
of us are ready to give answers to at

470
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:48,434
this point. Unless somebody wants

471
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:50,980
to contextualize this question.

472
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,888
I'm hoping a read of chapter four will

473
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:01,296
elucidate when the time comes. Just

474
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,170
exploring the formal foundations here.

475
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,890
Okay.

476
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,220
Okay.

477
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,934
Does anyone have a favorite or

478
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:20,282
recommended textbook that it contains

479
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,594
the KL divergence and Dearsley

480
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:25,630
distribution in the index.

481
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,762
This is for the math learning group.

482
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:31,282
Okay. Maybe we could tag some questions

483
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,074
too, and so then we can know which ones

484
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:36,900
they can look at. Wikipedia is good.

485
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,094
The Kale divergence is approachable.

486
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:43,346
The deerish lay is tougher. The links

487
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:44,918
take you to definitions that enable you

488
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:46,280
to put the pieces together.

489
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,434
Okay, any comments

490
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:55,834
on KL and Dear schley from

491
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,202
someone who is familiar? Otherwise it

492
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,186
sounds very technical and we don't need

493
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,500
to go into it right now.

494
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,786
What is up with dividing by sigma in a

495
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:20,700
31?

496
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,918
Also detail, but we'll

497
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:29,186
just see if there's any questions that

498
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,846
are not going to be specific details

499
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:38,046
because math is very hard to understand

500
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,546
sometimes on the fly and there's

501
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:42,274
definitely a space for the interactive

502
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,294
discussions around math that are

503
00:30:44,332 --> 00:30:47,580
unrecorded which are important.

504
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,786
However, this is a little bit of a

505
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,998
different format, which is how I'm

506
00:30:53,014 --> 00:30:58,090
hopefully interpreting people's activity

507
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,080
rather than their disengagements because

508
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,638
they are here and hopefully have at

509
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:07,150
least scanned these chapters.

510
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,002
Anyone can raise their hand at any time

511
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:20,820
or add questions or upload things.

512
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,110
Mean field mode,

513
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,950
equation nine, equation 16 probability

514
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,190
resource,

515
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,920
statistical question,

516
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,540
appendix B just to see if there was any.

517
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,994
Also seem like all details. So we

518
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:51,374
have 23 minutes. What does anybody want

519
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,560
to ask now?

520
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,800
Or is there some question here

521
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,402
like the most upvoted one or some other

522
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:06,450
one that's far less challenging that

523
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,794
they would like to address for the next

524
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:08,580
20 minutes?

525
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,466
Did anyone read Appendix A or B

526
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:54,410
visually?

527
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,182
Did you just ask if anyone read it?

528
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,894
Yes. What would anyone like to share

529
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:08,240
about reading it?

530
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,742
I totally read it with a highlighter and

531
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,046
made several notes in the margin in my

532
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:19,666
physical book. It was challenging. A lot

533
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:24,900
of the notation I feel like is

534
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,420
crazy,

535
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,854
even just independence b was it the very

536
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:36,518
first thing? Are they using O for

537
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:38,614
observations or are they using O for

538
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:42,540
outcomes? I was totally unclear on that.

539
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,486
Completely. So like state inference,

540
00:33:46,518 --> 00:33:50,426
Markov decision processes like the

541
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,874
states that influence outcomes O,

542
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:55,338
right? Literally. That's what it says on

543
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:58,766
the top of page 244. So it says that the

544
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,706
variable O is an outcome. Is an outcome

545
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,246
and observation. Are those the same

546
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,866
thing? Are they interchangeable? I've

547
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:08,686
always thought O was observations. I put

548
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,002
that question in there in the past.

549
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:14,354
It's already there and

550
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:17,026
then the question right before it. This

551
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:20,660
is a really tricky section. Right? So

552
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,622
the two questions that are in Appendix B

553
00:34:23,676 --> 00:34:24,918
that are together, it says the

554
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,326
likelihood of observations given a

555
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:27,446
policy is not straightforward to

556
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,782
compute. This is because POMDP problem

557
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,918
is structured so that policies pi

558
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,946
influence trajectories indicated by

559
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:36,374
tilde of states S that influence

560
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:39,066
outcomes o without a direct influence of

561
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:42,090
policies on outcomes. The problem then

562
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,522
involves the sum over trajectories of

563
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,274
states to marginalize these out and find

564
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:49,002
a marginal likelihood of observations

565
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,654
given policies. Like what does that

566
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,814
these even refer to? If you look in the

567
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:55,182
questions in Appendix B, they're there

568
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:56,990
in the questions already listed.

569
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,782
I felt like it was very obscure and not

570
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:03,442
super clear. And also the notation gets

571
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:06,850
crazy and I'm really a stickler for

572
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,546
defining every single variable and

573
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:10,306
symbol in an equation to understand the

574
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,926
math so that I can actually read it in

575
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:15,270
English. So I was a little bit lost.

576
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,680
Totally agree. Thanks for sharing it,

577
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,826
Eric. Just with respect to that

578
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:26,666
particular question, I think that

579
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:29,034
these refers to the trajectories of

580
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:32,426
states and you can see that because the

581
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:35,994
sum is over the tilde s. So the tilde s

582
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:38,000
is the trajectories of states.

583
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,806
So you sum over all the trajectories of

584
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:43,966
states to try to figure out, well, what

585
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:46,622
are we going to get if we apply a given

586
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:50,180
policy? That's my intuition about that.

587
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,002
And I suspect also that observations are

588
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:56,094
outcomes. They're sensory outcomes.

589
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:58,014
They're the outcome of a generative

590
00:35:58,142 --> 00:36:00,726
model or a generative process, but

591
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:03,510
they're the outcome that is observed.

592
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,146
How many dots we need to actually unpack

593
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:13,622
and connect for unsighted grammatically

594
00:36:13,686 --> 00:36:16,954
vague sentences. Right. So thank you.

595
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,422
My uncertainty has been reduced

596
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:21,930
substantially just by figuring that out.

597
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,738
But I felt like that the whole time I

598
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,358
was reading the appendix, I was like,

599
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,280
what is even going on here?

600
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeah.

601
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,854
Sir, the way I view it is like

602
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,158
exercising. You're not going to run a

603
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:38,802
marathon the first time you set out,

604
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:42,562
but the more you

605
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:45,726
stretch and warm up and I think that's

606
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:47,586
how I kind of view this. Going through

607
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,986
the appendix is kind of refreshing on

608
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,458
what you used to know about math, at

609
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:53,758
least for me. And so that's like

610
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:55,014
stretching and doing a little bit of

611
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:57,414
exercise last week. And then every time

612
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:59,446
you go through it, every time you see

613
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,174
the notation, you've slept on it some

614
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:03,442
more, it becomes more and more familiar.

615
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:04,858
And so you can start to put together

616
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,866
bigger, bigger chunks. Some vaguely you

617
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:10,742
can map to the notation and the math.

618
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:12,298
Other ones it's still going to be

619
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:13,674
dangling, but that's okay because

620
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:15,098
there's fewer dangling things that

621
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:17,578
you're groping with at any given moment.

622
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:19,086
So I think it's great to go through

623
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:20,622
these dependencies and see it all

624
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:23,246
through one pass and all right, so I

625
00:37:23,268 --> 00:37:25,134
didn't run a marathon, but that's okay.

626
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:27,182
I ran 2 miles. That's pretty good for

627
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,890
first start. Thanks,

628
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,834
Eric. Another metaphor is just like,

629
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,530
oh, yes, please. Jakub.

630
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,466
Yeah, I was just going to comment

631
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:43,800
on what Blue said with

632
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,914
some confusion about the notation

633
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:52,218
because I asked the question about the

634
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:53,866
marginalizing of state. But then I was

635
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:55,910
also confused about the O notation

636
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,026
because in equation B

637
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:04,070
one, it seems that it's a trajectory

638
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,294
over outcomes. But then there's also an

639
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:10,206
O without a tilde on it. So does that

640
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:11,726
mean that it's an outcome at a

641
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,326
particular point in time? But then

642
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:15,806
there's also a bold o,

643
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:18,306
which implies that it's kind of a

644
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,306
vector. But if it's a trajectory of

645
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:22,578
outcomes, that also seems to be a

646
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:26,078
vector. Like a trajectory for me implies

647
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:29,058
some kind of vector form because it's a

648
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,400
sequence of outcomes given a policy.

649
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,560
But then what does that bold O

650
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,154
mean if not trajectories over outcomes?

651
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:42,934
So just to kind of add

652
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,080
to the confusion, I guess.

653
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,774
Thanks, Jacob. I'm glad we're groking

654
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:51,066
we're on the same page, you and I for

655
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:51,660
sure.

656
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,390
It would be awesome for description or

657
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,134
any notes. What is the reading or a

658
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,390
reading in language?

659
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,786
The this of this conditioned on that is

660
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,226
this over that of these two things.

661
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:13,906
The first thing is this. The second one

662
00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:17,122
is that an example of that is in this

663
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:20,246
situation, here's the script, here's the

664
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,200
graphical abstract, here's the paper,

665
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,654
here's the person you could ask, which

666
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:27,046
one of these do you think is going to be

667
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:27,640
interesting?

668
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,186
Okay, so Mike asked, and I'll copy this

669
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,522
in for those who have read the entire

670
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,774
book. Did you find the appendices useful

671
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:42,970
as you went along through the chapters?

672
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,880
Ali.

673
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,488
Yeah. I also think that if the materials

674
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,564
in these two appendices were to be

675
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:15,784
integrated in the linear

676
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,796
narrative of the whole book, it would be

677
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:22,450
much more useful than separating out as

678
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,330
separate appendices. Because.

679
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,864
As we see, that's my own experience.

680
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:34,352
Well, reading the chapters independently

681
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:37,440
and in isolation of the narrative

682
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,990
doesn't give me a sense of their

683
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,524
concrete applications and I don't know

684
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:47,416
how to use them and how to use all

685
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:49,640
of these equations, and everything

686
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,320
becomes much more fuzzy.

687
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,860
I hope this is not controversial. That

688
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,648
linear reading of the appendix as

689
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,000
something that you look through is

690
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,364
extremely confusing or extremely

691
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:13,876
imprecise because there's many symbols

692
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,736
introduced that might have been

693
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:19,324
introduced earlier, like O is probably

694
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:23,192
discussed earlier, but then it's

695
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:25,516
briefly just sort of mentioned. And then

696
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,580
there's a lot of symbology that's not

697
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,928
mentioned. What it is. So it's hard to

698
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:32,204
read the appendix without prior

699
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:36,450
knowledge. Yet, ostensibly, Appendix A

700
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,720
is the introduction refresher.

701
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,280
So is this the introduction offering?

702
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,180
They hope so. They expect and prefer

703
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,504
perhaps the appendix to go some way

704
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:58,332
towards remedying it being

705
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:01,070
the maths required to understand this

706
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,780
not complicated basis.

707
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,626
The multidisciplinary basis means it is

708
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:11,326
often difficult to find resources that

709
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:12,522
bring together the necessary

710
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:16,622
prerequisites they're going some

711
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:20,298
way. So this is like one kind of plank

712
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:21,982
out there from their point of view,

713
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:24,866
from the chapters. This is stuff. Ali I

714
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:27,006
also kind of agree on what ordering

715
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:28,820
these are really interesting questions.

716
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,374
So then what is the next connector

717
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:36,770
that picks up here with this artifact?

718
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,498
Because someone mentioned how Moritz

719
00:42:43,534 --> 00:42:44,886
mentioned you could basically do a whole

720
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:46,838
course on deep learning to apply most of

721
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:49,446
the matrix operations and whole courses

722
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:52,986
on the math of them so they can't go

723
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,794
into all this detail. They can't spend 1

724
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:58,202
hour or like multiple coda pages on

725
00:42:58,256 --> 00:43:01,902
just what this means. So there

726
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,486
has to be some kind of compromise, but

727
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:04,702
then there's not going to be one

728
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:06,750
specific perfect compromise,

729
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,246
especially with like, length and

730
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:12,750
audience considered.

731
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,134
I undertook a very detailed linear

732
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,586
reading of the book because that's just

733
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:23,778
kind of how I am, of the appendixes at

734
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:26,820
least. But I think for many people that

735
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,918
I've been there before, where you're

736
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:31,590
staring at math equations like this is

737
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,942
gibberish. Just to read the text and

738
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:37,218
to read it and go through it, it's

739
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:39,962
helpful to know that it's there. So if

740
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:42,570
nothing else, at least you can be

741
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,314
reading the book and then be like, oh,

742
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:48,390
I remember kind of reading about Taylor

743
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,914
series expansion in the appendix. And so

744
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,014
then you can just go back and just

745
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:56,346
having access to it or the refresh

746
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:59,054
recall access, even though it is

747
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:01,098
confusing. I agree to try to a linear

748
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:02,830
read of the appendix.

749
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,294
I think skimming over it or deeply

750
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:08,962
reading it and then being able to refer

751
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:12,530
back to it is useful. Thanks, Blue.

752
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,360
So in next week,

753
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,066
we're going next two weeks. So the pace

754
00:44:20,098 --> 00:44:23,638
of one section per week might be like

755
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:25,526
whatever it was for you, however much

756
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:28,614
time you put in, et cetera. The coming

757
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:30,300
chapters are going to be very different

758
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,934
because one didn't have any formalisms

759
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:35,466
or figures really, just the kind of

760
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:37,338
overview figures. But we're going to

761
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:41,066
have two weeks for two. So no need to

762
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:42,998
rush it. Read a couple of pages and then

763
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:44,366
just go back to the beginning and just

764
00:44:44,388 --> 00:44:46,734
restart the same pages. That's like the

765
00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:49,162
multiple coats of paint in a mural.

766
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:51,546
Like the low road to active inference.

767
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:53,506
That's where they're going to pick up in

768
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:57,358
that high road, low road dialectic

769
00:44:57,454 --> 00:44:59,966
that we talked about last time. Let's

770
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:01,822
just see what figures, what equations

771
00:45:01,886 --> 00:45:05,480
might happen. Okay. Lot of terms that

772
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,062
hopefully are in the ontology already.

773
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:13,362
Like you can use the at symbol hopefully

774
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:16,978
to call most of them, but if something's

775
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,926
not there, we can add it to supplemental

776
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:23,798
or entailed. Okay, so what figures

777
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,490
and figures and equations will we might

778
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,220
see? Here's a box 2.1

779
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,590
about probability.

780
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,486
Here's an equation that's the

781
00:45:39,508 --> 00:45:42,874
Bayesian kernel and

782
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:45,314
it's going to be talking about this

783
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:48,402
example of a frog and an apple and

784
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:51,730
jumping or not jumping. And that example

785
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,926
is going to play a current role. But

786
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,894
then some likelihoods are shown in a

787
00:45:57,932 --> 00:45:59,926
specific example of like frogs and

788
00:45:59,948 --> 00:46:01,590
jumping or not and apples.

789
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,678
There's a work through example of exact

790
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,330
Bayesian inference.

791
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,502
Here's a table on statistical

792
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:13,770
distributions.

793
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,298
It would be really interesting, like to

794
00:46:18,304 --> 00:46:22,058
hear what support and surprise mean and

795
00:46:22,224 --> 00:46:23,646
what are these district? Are these all

796
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:25,518
the distributions? Are there other ones?

797
00:46:25,604 --> 00:46:27,486
Or like why these ones? Or why are they

798
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:30,126
useful? Where have they been used? What

799
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:31,280
does it even mean?

800
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,154
Here's where the KL divergence is

801
00:46:37,192 --> 00:46:41,294
introduced and then some more analysis

802
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:43,454
from a surprise perspective. Bayesian

803
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:46,230
surprise with the KL divergence.

804
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,214
There's the box on expectations, which

805
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:52,086
is also what we talked about a little

806
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:53,334
bit today. And that was really

807
00:46:53,372 --> 00:46:55,366
interesting to connect it to the

808
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:56,310
matrices.

809
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,958
A figure of the generative process

810
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:07,050
and the generative model is the caption

811
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,992
a figure both perception and action

812
00:47:14,056 --> 00:47:16,236
minimize discrepancy between model and

813
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:24,764
world free

814
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:25,390
energy.

815
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,096
Variational free energy as an upper

816
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:35,444
bound on negative log evidence the

817
00:47:35,482 --> 00:47:38,132
figure but with equations in it. Very

818
00:47:38,186 --> 00:47:42,490
common format figure

819
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,016
complementary roles of perception and

820
00:47:45,038 --> 00:47:46,584
action in the minimization of

821
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:49,912
variational free energy. Big act,

822
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:52,536
imp theme and like something kind of a

823
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:55,804
common fristinism like perception and.

824
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:58,652
Action, being in the same game or being

825
00:47:58,706 --> 00:48:00,620
in the same service of the same

826
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:01,870
objective function.

827
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,968
Planning but no specific

828
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,400
equations but probably citations.

829
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,228
Just introducing expected free energy,

830
00:48:17,414 --> 00:48:20,804
which Yaakob and others can probably

831
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,870
go into a lot more detail on.

832
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,620
Expected free energy about a future

833
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,430
where the outcomes haven't happened.

834
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,544
Expected free energy figure with

835
00:48:33,582 --> 00:48:37,130
equations, the end of the low road.

836
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,616
Introducing the two key terms

837
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,224
variational free energy, expected free

838
00:48:43,262 --> 00:48:46,440
energy summary

839
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,564
does anybody, like, want to, like, add

840
00:48:53,602 --> 00:48:55,504
or what was something cool or whether

841
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:57,090
they read it already or not?

842
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,390
What does anyone Ali? Yes, please.

843
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,096
Well, I've noticed the dispersion of

844
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:24,064
some sidebar boxes like box 2.1 or

845
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,600
in this chapter.

846
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,784
I don't know the distinction between the

847
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:34,012
purpose of these boxes and I mean,

848
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,884
what's the function of these boxes as

849
00:49:36,922 --> 00:49:38,996
compared to what we see in the

850
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:43,576
appendices? Because presumably these

851
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:46,472
boxes cover the concepts that could be

852
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,872
skipped over if one is familiar with

853
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:52,616
these mathematical concepts. So do you

854
00:49:52,638 --> 00:49:57,052
have any idea about the reason behind

855
00:49:57,186 --> 00:49:59,070
this decision? I mean,

856
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,456
covering some basic concepts, basic

857
00:50:02,488 --> 00:50:05,316
mathematical concepts in these sidebar

858
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:08,480
boxes and some others in the appendices?

859
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,154
That's a great question. A box could

860
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:25,350
reflect like, okay, expectations.

861
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,274
Got it. Or like, okay, some product

862
00:50:27,312 --> 00:50:29,726
rule. All right. But it's kind of like

863
00:50:29,828 --> 00:50:32,094
you might want to read that. Or is this

864
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:35,166
introductory highlighting it? This is

865
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:37,470
the 101 on probability.

866
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,902
Or is it saying this is a total

867
00:50:39,956 --> 00:50:41,474
skippable unit? If you want to learn

868
00:50:41,512 --> 00:50:43,966
about how the lizard does it, here's

869
00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:47,330
where you look. It can sometimes mean

870
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,740
both. And the format of the book is also

871
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:55,334
relatively austere, though in

872
00:50:55,372 --> 00:50:56,790
a concise tone.

873
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,566
It's in black and white, which

874
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:05,734
especially in some later sections make

875
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:09,046
some visualizations where it's like it's

876
00:51:09,078 --> 00:51:11,674
hard to understand what curves are doing

877
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:14,554
what it's a black and white image, so

878
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:16,518
what is there to see with the color?

879
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:20,154
But it also might predispose

880
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,282
towards more simple or visually

881
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:26,430
accessible material.

882
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:31,086
So what is going to be accessible and

883
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:32,546
the order. So those are all really

884
00:51:32,568 --> 00:51:35,506
important questions. So we can just take

885
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:37,774
notes on it in the weeks that we're

886
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:39,378
going to continue to do this because we

887
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:42,166
only have limited live time. How about

888
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:43,798
in the last like 3 minutes? What does

889
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:46,034
anybody think about the opening

890
00:51:46,162 --> 00:51:48,822
quotations or specifically this

891
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:52,598
quotation? My thinking

892
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:55,174
is first and last and always for the

893
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,750
sake of my doing. William James.

894
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,120
I thought the guy was a philosopher, so

895
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,250
I guess you just abused me of that one.

896
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,240
I.

897
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:17,960
Yeah,

898
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,994
these would be really nice areas to look

899
00:52:26,032 --> 00:52:28,618
into for people who like the history

900
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:32,426
part. Blue and I and

901
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:34,202
others are working on some different

902
00:52:34,256 --> 00:52:37,440
kinds of ways to reference papers and

903
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,770
just up cool paper. Sensation

904
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,526
perception. We have those terms. We

905
00:52:44,548 --> 00:52:47,854
could just link the paper somewhere. So

906
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:49,106
if anyone's like, interested in that

907
00:52:49,128 --> 00:52:53,554
kind of architectures or that

908
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:58,546
kind of philosophy question the

909
00:52:58,568 --> 00:53:01,174
literature right now. Is small enough to

910
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:03,526
know what has and hasn't been done in a

911
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:06,534
lot of areas that are philosophical and

912
00:53:06,572 --> 00:53:08,070
applied and technical.

913
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,014
But just from, like, the first

914
00:53:15,052 --> 00:53:17,720
principles, what does this seem to mean.

915
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,846
That shared that other group that

916
00:53:23,948 --> 00:53:27,110
we're kind of both a part of Daniel

917
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,178
Liminal dow thing. That's not really a

918
00:53:33,184 --> 00:53:34,618
dow. I don't know what it is, but

919
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:37,434
there's this debate for some reason

920
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:40,910
that's going on there about different

921
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,030
ways of knowing and being and

922
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,902
doing and a bunch of stuff that

923
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:51,046
is kind of a mix

924
00:53:51,098 --> 00:53:53,310
of philosophy and linguistic fallacies.

925
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,522
But if

926
00:53:57,576 --> 00:54:00,338
thinking is actually a physical process,

927
00:54:00,424 --> 00:54:04,086
which I think anyone here is going

928
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,870
to argue against, then it is something

929
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,240
necessarily that is being done.

930
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,278
However, I guess, small, you want to

931
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,650
draw that Markov blanket. And then

932
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,906
however large, whether that's your

933
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:22,214
physical body actions or some extended

934
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:27,834
thinking, it's literally what

935
00:54:27,872 --> 00:54:28,700
you're doing.

936
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,734
It's not just for the sake of your

937
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,030
actions, but they are your actions.

938
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,554
They're just another set of your

939
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:45,378
actions. All right. I'll offer a

940
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:47,986
different take on it. Yeah. Awesome.

941
00:54:48,168 --> 00:54:50,770
William James was a great visionary,

942
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,810
and he foresaw Mark's Mark Zuckerberg's

943
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,990
metaverse 120

944
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,680
years ago or whatever, and he said, no,

945
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,414
I don't want to live just inside my

946
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:08,346
mind, inside the metaverse. I want to be

947
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:10,554
out in the world, interact with real

948
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:14,246
people and real things. So he was a meta

949
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,500
or Facebook skeptic way before his time.

950
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,750
Okay. Thank you, Ali.

951
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:28,734
Yeah. As Brock mentioned, I think it

952
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:31,710
relates to an epistemological

953
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,510
distinction between propositional

954
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,666
knowledge and how to knowledge. And I

955
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:45,534
think this statement by this statement

956
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:48,850
here tries to blur this distinction,

957
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,690
blurs the line between propositional

958
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,274
knowledge and know how knowledge.

959
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:57,794
Because especially in analytical school

960
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:01,660
of philosophy, there's always been

961
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,860
a very, let's say

962
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,246
not a heated debate, but there's a

963
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:15,582
long standing debate about

964
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:18,746
the distinction between these two kinds

965
00:56:18,778 --> 00:56:22,874
of knowledge and whether in fact they

966
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:25,954
can be distinguished from each other or

967
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:29,442
not. Thank you.

968
00:56:29,496 --> 00:56:32,194
Could you just unpack what are the two

969
00:56:32,232 --> 00:56:34,450
kinds of knowledge again, and what are

970
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,000
just they referring to?

971
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,610
Sure. Well, about propositional

972
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,046
knowledge well, an example of

973
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:47,094
propositional knowledge is to know the

974
00:56:47,132 --> 00:56:51,130
exact mechanisms of walking.

975
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:55,770
I mean, which muscles contract and which

976
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,370
I mean, in what angles.

977
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:07,274
The whole thing about the biomechanics

978
00:57:07,322 --> 00:57:08,894
of walking, the whole knowledge about

979
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:11,406
the biomechanics of knowledge can

980
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:13,950
constitute this kind of propositional

981
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,250
knowledge. And it's totally different

982
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,580
from knowing how to walk. I mean,

983
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,666
a three or four year old year old child

984
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:26,882
has a know how knowledge of walking,

985
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:30,390
but not necessarily where

986
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,694
he or she doesn't know anything about

987
00:57:32,732 --> 00:57:35,286
the biomechanics of walking. So the

988
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:37,574
biomechanics of walking is the

989
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:40,266
propositional knowledge. Actually,

990
00:57:40,368 --> 00:57:43,434
knowing how to walk constitutes the know

991
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:46,010
how of walking.

992
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,356
So when people say things like active

993
00:57:57,388 --> 00:57:59,932
inference is integrating perception,

994
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:03,264
cognition, and action, maybe it is

995
00:58:03,302 --> 00:58:06,140
rethinking some of these long held

996
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,212
mental frameworks for distinguishing or

997
00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:12,356
operating differently on action and

998
00:58:12,378 --> 00:58:16,752
perception. Like, one fascinating

999
00:58:16,816 --> 00:58:19,656
recent example from me and working with

1000
00:58:19,678 --> 00:58:23,032
Eric was in the area of ant

1001
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,888
pheromone modeling. Without going into

1002
00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:27,316
too many details, people often modeled

1003
00:58:27,348 --> 00:58:29,576
preference as a function of the absolute

1004
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:33,212
amount of pheromone on trails because

1005
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:34,716
that's what the exponential, like,

1006
00:58:34,738 --> 00:58:36,076
decay is on. That's what can be

1007
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:40,264
manipulated rather than the perceived

1008
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:43,052
intensity, which might have a different

1009
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:44,956
scaling relationship. So it's like a dim

1010
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,544
room, you can detect a small change.

1011
00:58:46,582 --> 00:58:48,432
Bright room, you can't detect a small

1012
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:52,176
change. So that kind of psychophysics of

1013
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:58,180
perception gets ignored implicitly

1014
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,980
because of calls for measurability,

1015
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,760
because the cognitive can't be measured

1016
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,510
directly. Even if you potentially had an

1017
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,656
electrical measurement or something like

1018
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:10,570
that happening,

1019
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,496
then these are awesome questions. Can

1020
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:17,064
you think without acting or is thinking

1021
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:17,960
in action?

1022
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,764
This active paper, which was

1023
00:59:28,802 --> 00:59:30,268
on a live stream, so we can provide the

1024
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:35,040
link to it.

1025
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,696
Models like perception and action in the

1026
00:59:37,718 --> 00:59:40,896
sort of like kernel level, just the

1027
00:59:40,918 --> 00:59:44,050
autonomous sensing sentient bot level.

1028
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,524
And then attention and metacognition are

1029
00:59:47,562 --> 00:59:51,876
both related as actions to

1030
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:54,756
the lower level, which is like why the

1031
00:59:54,778 --> 00:59:57,968
paper is relating computational

1032
00:59:58,064 --> 01:00:01,400
phenomenology with mental action.

1033
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,796
Again, just to have a look at the kinds

1034
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,570
of models that can happen.

1035
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,200
And then now does making any model,

1036
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,604
fitting any data well enough and saying,

1037
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:17,404
well, we modeled it as action. So is

1038
01:00:17,442 --> 01:00:20,636
thinking in action? Will that model that

1039
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,044
says, yeah, it's consistent with that,

1040
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:24,436
will that ever constitute positive

1041
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,556
evidence for saying thinking is action?

1042
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,064
Or why even say that?

1043
01:00:30,182 --> 01:00:32,050
Or what does it mean to say it?

1044
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,400
And then here's a funny meme.

1045
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,836
Here's the generative model and the

1046
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:43,168
generative the partially observable

1047
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,856
Markov decision process. Here's Karl,

1048
01:00:45,888 --> 01:00:46,740
Friston,

1049
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,070
Jessica and then anyone else.

1050
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,772
Yes. I guess it's like a beginning

1051
01:01:00,836 --> 01:01:04,664
understanding of this. I tend to think

1052
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:08,680
that there's like a bias towards action

1053
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,484
in active inference. I think the first

1054
01:01:11,522 --> 01:01:14,844
chapter is saying even if you want to

1055
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,244
sense or perceive, you have to do some

1056
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:20,384
kind of action in order to gain the

1057
01:01:20,422 --> 01:01:23,570
information. And this

1058
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,688
quote is basically saying like, okay,

1059
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:29,216
even though the whole field is trying to

1060
01:01:29,238 --> 01:01:30,560
understand cognition,

1061
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,060
what we decide to do and the thinking

1062
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,944
that we go through in order to determine

1063
01:01:36,992 --> 01:01:39,744
our policy is to determine our actions.

1064
01:01:39,792 --> 01:01:42,704
And then it sort of feed into the

1065
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:44,664
thinking itself. So maybe that's why

1066
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:48,984
there's like the bias to action because

1067
01:01:49,102 --> 01:01:50,984
our actions is what it's going to be

1068
01:01:51,022 --> 01:01:57,096
allowing the thinking. But when

1069
01:01:57,118 --> 01:01:59,576
we update our models or trying to come

1070
01:01:59,598 --> 01:02:01,196
up with the policies that we're going to

1071
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,904
be doing, like, we have to be processing

1072
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:06,270
things. So the thinking is in

1073
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,620
as a service to action.

1074
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,404
That's sort of like what I was thinking.

1075
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:13,296
I don't know, it's a little bit like the

1076
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:16,576
chicken and the egg, but I

1077
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:18,176
kind of tend to think of it. It's like,

1078
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:20,564
yes, we have to act in order to

1079
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:23,904
understand, but the understanding

1080
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,476
which will be coming from the thinking

1081
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:28,340
is what determines our next action.

1082
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,020
Yeah, that's kind of what I was

1083
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,590
thinking.

1084
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,320
Matthew. Thanks, Jessica.

1085
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,612
Yeah, it kind of seems to me like we're

1086
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,500
stuck in a little bit of a linguistic

1087
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,810
Godellian loop of some sort because

1088
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,652
thinking is essentially a verb and

1089
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:54,448
verbs tend to imply, in a linguistic

1090
01:02:54,464 --> 01:02:57,604
emergent term, actions. And so we

1091
01:02:57,642 --> 01:02:59,924
have to then pop outside of that and try

1092
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:01,716
to consider with our internal mental

1093
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:03,944
processes how to disentangle these

1094
01:03:03,982 --> 01:03:08,584
concepts. But I see no reason to think,

1095
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:12,008
ironically, that internal mental states

1096
01:03:12,094 --> 01:03:15,076
aren't also conscious parameterizations

1097
01:03:15,108 --> 01:03:17,724
of processes in the brain and our

1098
01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:19,676
ability to grasp control of that to some

1099
01:03:19,698 --> 01:03:21,708
extent. And so it seems very strange to

1100
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,980
me to try to separate those

1101
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,876
linguistically from our current vantage

1102
01:03:26,908 --> 01:03:28,144
point, even though I understand why,

1103
01:03:28,182 --> 01:03:30,096
historically, working only with

1104
01:03:30,118 --> 01:03:32,768
language, it might have made sense. So

1105
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,196
those kind of quotes like James strike

1106
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:39,456
me as somewhat antiquated

1107
01:03:39,568 --> 01:03:42,628
or just operating on dichotomies that

1108
01:03:42,714 --> 01:03:44,516
don't seem to make sense given that

1109
01:03:44,538 --> 01:03:46,548
we've unpacked these processes to the

1110
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:47,510
degree we have.

1111
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,770
Thank you, Matthew. Very deep points.

1112
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,964
Like you mentioned, thinking as a verb

1113
01:03:57,012 --> 01:04:01,048
implies action. And then just to kind of

1114
01:04:01,214 --> 01:04:04,830
complete that thought is like the word

1115
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,636
for the noun form of this one. So then

1116
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:09,900
what does that imply?

1117
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,130
And then also, like Jessica mentioned,

1118
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,324
to. Some extent that we can only express

1119
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:25,680
processes through their discretization

1120
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,920
via symbols. Right. The idea

1121
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,068
that there's this process, there's a

1122
01:04:32,074 --> 01:04:33,184
flow, there's something that can't

1123
01:04:33,232 --> 01:04:35,140
necessarily be separated,

1124
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,464
obviously, from the rest of the flows

1125
01:04:38,512 --> 01:04:41,704
around it. But to reference it, to point

1126
01:04:41,742 --> 01:04:43,608
to it, to describe it, communicate it to

1127
01:04:43,614 --> 01:04:47,450
another agent, we have to nounize it

1128
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:51,016
kind of like which is the opposite of

1129
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:52,890
verbalizing, so to speak.

1130
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,340
Wow. Thank you, Matthew.

1131
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,740
Again. These are yes. Eric.

1132
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,562
Sorry, I didn't have anything. I didn't

1133
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:16,026
have the hand was yeah. So Karl

1134
01:05:16,058 --> 01:05:19,630
Friston had an influential 2019

1135
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:23,680
paper. Long paper.

1136
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,386
The free energy principle for a

1137
01:05:26,408 --> 01:05:29,566
particular physics. That was in 2019.

1138
01:05:29,678 --> 01:05:32,242
So it's been several years since then.

1139
01:05:32,376 --> 01:05:35,970
And like, particular allegedly

1140
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,770
accidentally or intentionally is a pun.

1141
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,626
So it can mean specific, like a physics

1142
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:44,226
for the specific systems that we're

1143
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:46,694
modeling. Or it could be specific, like

1144
01:05:46,732 --> 01:05:50,378
this is a specific approach. Another

1145
01:05:50,464 --> 01:05:53,338
interpretation is like it's for

1146
01:05:53,504 --> 01:05:56,826
particulate entities when we

1147
01:05:56,848 --> 01:06:00,394
define thing and the partition, which is

1148
01:06:00,432 --> 01:06:02,394
going to coinstantiate, like the

1149
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:03,754
generative model and the generative

1150
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:05,806
process and then the Markov blanket or

1151
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,840
the interface that's separating them,

1152
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:11,646
that is separating the figure from

1153
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:13,134
ground. It's separating, like, the

1154
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:16,222
entity from the niche. It's separating

1155
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:20,334
what from what? What can it represent?

1156
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:24,002
The separation of something from all

1157
01:06:24,056 --> 01:06:27,570
possible separations, some separations.

1158
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:31,718
And then, Matthew, you mentioned, like

1159
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:34,898
yeah, verbalizing speech, but it feels

1160
01:06:34,914 --> 01:06:38,280
like we're speaking nouns sometimes.

1161
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,154
Yet verbalization is a process,

1162
01:06:42,352 --> 01:06:44,970
especially dialogue. Yes. Matthew.

1163
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,978
Could I ask a question that brings in a

1164
01:06:49,984 --> 01:06:51,674
little bit of content from the other

1165
01:06:51,712 --> 01:06:53,834
chapters of the book is that yeah,

1166
01:06:53,872 --> 01:06:56,286
sure. I'm just kind of curious because

1167
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:58,058
when you're talking about those, you're

1168
01:06:58,074 --> 01:07:00,718
talking about the Markov blankets and

1169
01:07:00,804 --> 01:07:02,766
integrating it into this idea of how we

1170
01:07:02,788 --> 01:07:05,298
draw boundaries. I'm kind of curious.

1171
01:07:05,464 --> 01:07:08,942
Is it fair to say that to the extent

1172
01:07:09,006 --> 01:07:12,322
we've drawn our boundaries and do see a

1173
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:14,962
reduction of free energy in this system,

1174
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:17,614
it reinforces the idea that there's

1175
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:21,682
something to that boundary structure

1176
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,538
as an entity in the world, that there's

1177
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:25,014
a reality to that? Is that a fair

1178
01:07:25,052 --> 01:07:25,990
interpretation?

1179
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,712
I think many people would have a lot to

1180
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:35,656
say and add. This touches on the

1181
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:37,620
question of reification of scientific

1182
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,208
models and the

1183
01:07:41,294 --> 01:07:44,648
ability for identified statistical model

1184
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:48,380
to be like transcending itself and used

1185
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:51,464
in a realist way, like ontologically

1186
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:54,430
real about true joints of the world.

1187
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,316
And I'm going to go to live stream

1188
01:07:58,348 --> 01:08:01,936
table and find several of those

1189
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,984
who explained their research on this

1190
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:07,388
topic. But even short of trying to claim

1191
01:08:07,404 --> 01:08:10,756
it's real, does that ability like once

1192
01:08:10,778 --> 01:08:13,636
we've drawn a boundary using these

1193
01:08:13,658 --> 01:08:16,980
Markov blankets and we do see that

1194
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,380
it seems to be, let's say, using

1195
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:22,820
information to self evidence,

1196
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,608
do we? Think that that's I mean, it

1197
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:29,556
seems. Like. This paradigm

1198
01:08:29,588 --> 01:08:31,272
of thought is predicated on the idea

1199
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:33,816
that to the extent that that occurs and

1200
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:35,752
reduces free energy, it should attract,

1201
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:37,468
or further attract attention, at the

1202
01:08:37,474 --> 01:08:39,372
very least, for examination or

1203
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:40,380
investigation.

1204
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,628
Yes. So, great questions, Jacob. Do you

1205
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:47,664
have something to add on that or is it a

1206
01:08:47,702 --> 01:08:51,068
slightly different area? I guess it's

1207
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:53,804
kind of related to the Markov blanket

1208
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:54,640
discussion.

1209
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,296
This may be completely wrong, but it

1210
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:03,104
seems to me like with that,

1211
01:09:03,142 --> 01:09:05,456
this kind of discretization of the

1212
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:09,012
Markov blankets forces us to a specific

1213
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:11,876
kind of discrete thinking. But I feel

1214
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:15,496
like that just this model of a

1215
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,536
Markov blanket. I think of it as a kind

1216
01:09:18,558 --> 01:09:21,576
of classical model, but I presume that

1217
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:23,992
the reality is more something like a

1218
01:09:24,046 --> 01:09:27,996
schrodinger Markov blanket where we

1219
01:09:28,018 --> 01:09:30,350
can't really draw boundaries between

1220
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,512
thinking and observing a generative

1221
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:36,332
process. In the same way that we can

1222
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:39,596
think of, say, electrons as balls

1223
01:09:39,628 --> 01:09:42,816
bouncing off each other, but we can

1224
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:44,576
think of them as classical particles and

1225
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:48,316
that will help us to an extent,

1226
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:52,244
but then we can also observe the

1227
01:09:52,282 --> 01:09:54,852
process of thinking. So thinking is also

1228
01:09:54,986 --> 01:09:57,872
kind of entangled with the generative

1229
01:09:57,936 --> 01:10:01,828
process. So even though

1230
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:04,452
the Markov blanket is a useful

1231
01:10:04,516 --> 01:10:08,584
formalism, I think that there

1232
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:13,064
are definitely certain scenarios that in

1233
01:10:13,102 --> 01:10:16,088
which it's more like a probabilistic.

1234
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:19,836
Well, it's already probabilistic, but in

1235
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:23,016
the sense that the entity that's

1236
01:10:23,048 --> 01:10:26,524
performing inference also in

1237
01:10:26,562 --> 01:10:30,720
its own inference loop

1238
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,904
performs inference on itself and

1239
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:37,344
therefore thinking is at the same time

1240
01:10:37,382 --> 01:10:41,140
an action, but at the same time it's

1241
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,590
part of the generative process.

1242
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:54,426
Another angle on this thanks Jacob,

1243
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,950
is what Dean T often talks about with

1244
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,778
active inference as a framework or a

1245
01:10:59,784 --> 01:11:01,746
filter. These are just sort of like

1246
01:11:01,848 --> 01:11:03,506
different distinctions that might be

1247
01:11:03,528 --> 01:11:05,842
transiently useful in some axis, like

1248
01:11:05,976 --> 01:11:08,606
fitting something to a framework. It's

1249
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:10,998
kind of the procrusty's bed. Stretch it

1250
01:11:11,004 --> 01:11:13,558
out so that this perception and then

1251
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,134
active as a filter, was reminding me of

1252
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,646
what Matthew was saying, like going out

1253
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:21,954
and discovering divergences from

1254
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:24,534
expectation of there not being metabolic

1255
01:11:24,582 --> 01:11:27,210
activity on a planet. And then there is

1256
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,870
some statistical deviation.

1257
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,534
And so, like, in the classical

1258
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:34,186
statistical framework, that might be

1259
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,146
like it's a one sigma difference in the

1260
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:39,494
Bayesian framework, well, there's a base

1261
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:43,022
factor of two. And here for this

1262
01:11:43,156 --> 01:11:45,934
evidence, and there's other ways to talk

1263
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:49,346
about detection of novel entities that

1264
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:51,022
might be part of, like, a reification

1265
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:54,862
process of the extended cognition

1266
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:56,130
of the modelers.

1267
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,576
Then, like, one philosophical angle on

1268
01:12:01,598 --> 01:12:06,424
that. And then also anyone who wants

1269
01:12:06,462 --> 01:12:09,736
to read, then Ali is this book by Helen

1270
01:12:09,768 --> 01:12:12,284
Longineau which talks about

1271
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:15,216
methodological pluralism and about how

1272
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:17,532
there can be, like, disciplinary rigor

1273
01:12:17,676 --> 01:12:20,060
and the ways in which often unstated,

1274
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,210
like social priors can be

1275
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:27,824
the substance of what becomes understood

1276
01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:30,592
to be science as, like, a complex

1277
01:12:30,656 --> 01:12:33,940
phenomena. Ali and then Brock.

1278
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,750
Adding to what Yakov said, I think

1279
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,252
the concept of Markov blanket emanates

1280
01:12:43,316 --> 01:12:46,888
from the Plutonian way of

1281
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:51,400
thinking, specifically hylomorphism

1282
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,916
school of thought as

1283
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:59,864
opposed to hylozoism. The distinction

1284
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:02,396
between hylomorphism and hylozoism is

1285
01:13:02,418 --> 01:13:05,520
that, well, in hylomorphism,

1286
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,672
everything is disconnected. Every

1287
01:13:08,726 --> 01:13:12,912
concept is disconnected and with

1288
01:13:12,966 --> 01:13:15,456
every other concept. And so there's a

1289
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,472
discontinuity, metaphysical

1290
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:20,528
discontinuity between the concepts.

1291
01:13:20,704 --> 01:13:23,780
But in hylozoism,

1292
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,590
the philosophers advocating this

1293
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:32,840
school of thought, well, they claim that

1294
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:37,320
hylomorphism fails at answering

1295
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,840
the question of what it is adequately,

1296
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,828
and they even rephrase the question.

1297
01:13:44,914 --> 01:13:47,740
And they claim that the right question

1298
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:50,908
to ask is not what it is,

1299
01:13:51,074 --> 01:13:55,168
it's what it can do. So that's basically

1300
01:13:55,254 --> 01:13:57,664
the distinction between hylomorphism and

1301
01:13:57,702 --> 01:14:01,232
hylozoism. But I think the mark

1302
01:14:01,286 --> 01:14:06,120
of blanket is a way of formalizing

1303
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:09,716
this hylomorphic way of

1304
01:14:09,738 --> 01:14:12,980
thinking. At least that's my opinion.

1305
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,060
Thanks a lot for that, Ollie. Eric?

1306
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,752
Sorry, I'm not hearing Eric. Can others

1307
01:14:30,806 --> 01:14:31,840
hear Eric?

1308
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:38,526
Maybe I need to reload. Can you

1309
01:14:38,548 --> 01:14:40,830
hear me? Okay, I'm going to reload.

1310
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,614
Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear blue.

1311
01:15:02,662 --> 01:15:04,454
Okay. You're still not hearing Eric,

1312
01:15:04,502 --> 01:15:07,626
though? No, sorry. Yeah, I just did,

1313
01:15:07,648 --> 01:15:09,370
like, a small disrupt.

1314
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,152
Okay, wait, eric, try again.

1315
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:23,636
Okay. How about now? Yeah, now I can see

1316
01:15:23,658 --> 01:15:25,364
you in here again. Okay. How about

1317
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:28,660
everyone else who's the audience?

1318
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:32,772
Okay. Wow. Disrupt on the high low

1319
01:15:32,826 --> 01:15:35,050
field. It's happened before.

1320
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:40,356
I just throw in my two cent about my

1321
01:15:40,398 --> 01:15:41,816
interpretation of a markup blanket.

1322
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:46,860
It's about trying to perform

1323
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:49,064
simplifications that make computation

1324
01:15:49,192 --> 01:15:51,468
tractable. If you have everything

1325
01:15:51,554 --> 01:15:53,264
interacting with everything else, then

1326
01:15:53,302 --> 01:15:57,840
we can't do computing on that. So we

1327
01:15:57,910 --> 01:16:01,280
apply compartmentalization and

1328
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:04,736
build objects and interfaces for how the

1329
01:16:04,758 --> 01:16:06,470
objects interact with one another,

1330
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,504
and those become tractable.

1331
01:16:11,552 --> 01:16:15,348
That's what a

1332
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:17,444
Bay's net does, is it says what are

1333
01:16:17,562 --> 01:16:19,880
independent and what are dependent

1334
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:24,120
variables on each other. And that works

1335
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:27,076
well when those abstractions,

1336
01:16:27,188 --> 01:16:29,368
the objects and relations, nouns and

1337
01:16:29,374 --> 01:16:31,932
verbs are a good fit to how the world

1338
01:16:31,986 --> 01:16:34,984
actually operates. So that is a driver

1339
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:37,340
for learning or building representations

1340
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,132
that will use these Markov blankets and

1341
01:16:41,186 --> 01:16:43,688
put the compartments where they actually

1342
01:16:43,794 --> 01:16:46,540
are faithful to the compartmentalization

1343
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,576
that we can abstract over the way the

1344
01:16:48,598 --> 01:16:50,752
world parts in the world operate. So

1345
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:53,120
things that are distant, that separate,

1346
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,096
that interact only weekly, we try to

1347
01:16:56,118 --> 01:16:57,936
maybe factor those out, pretend they

1348
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,164
don't interact at all, or use some other

1349
01:17:00,202 --> 01:17:02,356
intermediate variables to represent the

1350
01:17:02,378 --> 01:17:04,196
interaction in order to simplify things

1351
01:17:04,218 --> 01:17:06,916
so we can do computation. So that's how

1352
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:08,568
I think Marco blankets and we'll see if

1353
01:17:08,574 --> 01:17:10,248
the math tells us that later on when we

1354
01:17:10,254 --> 01:17:15,560
get to it. Awesome. Brock ethanoli.

1355
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,222
Okay. I'm like not hearing Brock,

1356
01:17:29,286 --> 01:17:32,734
unfortunately. Do you? Yes, we all

1357
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,574
hear Brock. Brock is reloading, I think

1358
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:37,454
now. Again. Okay. Yeah. Gather does this

1359
01:17:37,492 --> 01:17:40,718
sometimes, but I don't

1360
01:17:40,724 --> 01:17:43,360
know if it's because we have 15 people.

1361
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:46,638
Yeah, but like Matthew said, I don't

1362
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:47,774
hear him. It's just like there's

1363
01:17:47,822 --> 01:17:49,250
different drop offs.

1364
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,726
I can hear you, but I still think Daniel

1365
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:55,538
can't hear you. Daniel, you can't wait.

1366
01:17:55,624 --> 01:17:57,782
Now you're back. Go for it. Okay,

1367
01:17:57,836 --> 01:18:00,598
continue. Interesting. Can you hear me?

1368
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:02,520
Yeah. Oh, okay.

1369
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,742
Yeah. This is just this ongoing thing

1370
01:18:06,796 --> 01:18:09,034
that I don't know, we just keeps coming

1371
01:18:09,072 --> 01:18:11,706
up about. Yeah, well, okay, maybe they

1372
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:13,606
exist, maybe they don't. Markov

1373
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:16,682
blankets, really? But how would they

1374
01:18:16,736 --> 01:18:21,166
form in any how

1375
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:23,178
would they form an evolving collapse?

1376
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:26,720
Presumably there is some point

1377
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:30,862
in that process, this evolution part

1378
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:34,500
where the Markov blanket is

1379
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:39,902
extremely poorly defined relative

1380
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:43,380
to the system and that's basically

1381
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:47,158
these sort of underexplored areas. It

1382
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:49,186
was also in relation to Matthew's

1383
01:18:49,218 --> 01:18:52,070
question also about the free energy

1384
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,026
minimization thing where there's systems

1385
01:18:55,058 --> 01:18:58,222
like non equilibrium systems

1386
01:18:58,306 --> 01:19:01,930
basically, where still something

1387
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,594
interesting worthy of study is

1388
01:19:05,632 --> 01:19:09,500
happening, but perhaps is not

1389
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:15,886
free energy minimizing in

1390
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:19,582
that state. Thanks for

1391
01:19:19,636 --> 01:19:21,630
sharing it. Just a few thoughts.

1392
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,646
Let's just say some sort of meso scale

1393
01:19:27,678 --> 01:19:29,298
or global as that's called, but that

1394
01:19:29,304 --> 01:19:30,706
doesn't mean about the whole world, but

1395
01:19:30,728 --> 01:19:32,482
some sort of global free energy

1396
01:19:32,536 --> 01:19:34,898
minimization in the joint model is

1397
01:19:34,984 --> 01:19:38,662
achieved like in a conversation that

1398
01:19:38,716 --> 01:19:41,414
isn't the same thing as the local

1399
01:19:41,612 --> 01:19:43,746
disconnected free energy minimization.

1400
01:19:43,938 --> 01:19:47,234
Otherwise fitting high parameter models

1401
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,074
optimally would be simply reducing to

1402
01:19:50,112 --> 01:19:53,702
fitting single dimensional models alone.

1403
01:19:53,766 --> 01:19:54,854
If we could just do the linear

1404
01:19:54,902 --> 01:19:56,406
optimization on the standalone

1405
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:58,922
variables, then why would we ever need

1406
01:19:58,976 --> 01:20:02,880
the larger dimensional methods? And then

1407
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,782
think of this textbook maybe with

1408
01:20:08,836 --> 01:20:10,222
where things could be in the coming

1409
01:20:10,276 --> 01:20:13,674
years. The Markov

1410
01:20:13,722 --> 01:20:16,762
membrane is like the linear algebra.

1411
01:20:16,906 --> 01:20:18,574
And then Jacob mentioned that this is

1412
01:20:18,612 --> 01:20:22,190
classical model. It is kind of classical

1413
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:25,486
in a sense, in the timeless classic

1414
01:20:25,598 --> 01:20:29,506
sense. So the one layer Markov

1415
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:32,486
blanket when thinking about the rise and

1416
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:36,294
fall of civilization is not the

1417
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,050
end all that's. Like I think maybe

1418
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,994
analogous to a linear regression y

1419
01:20:42,032 --> 01:20:46,042
equals MX plus B and then you have all

1420
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:48,026
these hundred years of development on

1421
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:51,374
the linear regression model and all

1422
01:20:51,412 --> 01:20:53,326
these techniques and applications and

1423
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,874
pipelines. So the Markov blanket

1424
01:20:56,922 --> 01:21:00,458
one layer potentially over interpreting

1425
01:21:00,474 --> 01:21:02,618
it as already presenting with strengths

1426
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:06,242
or weaknesses in certain situations when

1427
01:21:06,296 --> 01:21:07,662
not being just like empirically

1428
01:21:07,726 --> 01:21:10,660
demonstrated. In the general case,

1429
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:15,300
we'll see what could be said and when.

1430
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:16,850
Matthew.

1431
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:21,478
Yeah, along those lines, I was kind of

1432
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:23,158
curious. I've seen that there's been a

1433
01:21:23,164 --> 01:21:25,254
decent amount of work on the sort of

1434
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:27,654
hierarchical or fractal composition of

1435
01:21:27,692 --> 01:21:30,842
these models. I'm curious if that

1436
01:21:30,896 --> 01:21:33,866
implies that there's a fractality to the

1437
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:36,650
boundary by default or if there needs

1438
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,338
there any specific work on sort of

1439
01:21:39,344 --> 01:21:41,238
hierarchical composition of the

1440
01:21:41,264 --> 01:21:42,906
boundaries of that so called membrane.

1441
01:21:42,938 --> 01:21:43,840
As you said.

1442
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,662
With better annotation, we could have

1443
01:21:49,716 --> 01:21:52,558
better answers because there's many

1444
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:54,586
papers that we've discussed in a guest

1445
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,026
stream or a paper and there's also like

1446
01:21:57,048 --> 01:21:59,714
many other papers obviously, that we

1447
01:21:59,752 --> 01:22:01,860
don't have that kind of annotations of

1448
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,610
because it's quite common to see nested

1449
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:11,458
models in the context of nesting

1450
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:13,666
of cognitive processes. Like in that San

1451
01:22:13,698 --> 01:22:15,254
Fed Smith paper, which was I think,

1452
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:18,166
number 25. That was about cognition as

1453
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:20,938
mental action. So that was nested and

1454
01:22:20,944 --> 01:22:23,062
the nesting was interpreted as cognitive

1455
01:22:23,126 --> 01:22:26,218
actions and counterfactuals, basically.

1456
01:22:26,384 --> 01:22:28,538
And then sometimes nesting is used to

1457
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:31,482
refer to actual, like, well, the state

1458
01:22:31,536 --> 01:22:33,646
is inside of the country and then the

1459
01:22:33,668 --> 01:22:35,466
region is inside of the state. It's

1460
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:38,478
implied that the map is mapping onto the

1461
01:22:38,484 --> 01:22:41,406
territory, maybe even spatially, the

1462
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:44,858
cell is inside of the tissue. And that's

1463
01:22:44,874 --> 01:22:47,060
like answering Schrodinger's question.

1464
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:49,774
Everything happening with the planetary

1465
01:22:49,822 --> 01:22:53,140
scale analyses, cellular level.

1466
01:22:56,870 --> 01:23:00,550
And then this is hopefully what is

1467
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,094
spoken to with the composability of

1468
01:23:03,132 --> 01:23:05,794
active inference. And sometimes that's

1469
01:23:05,842 --> 01:23:07,874
framed in terms of the lateral

1470
01:23:07,922 --> 01:23:11,146
composability of you could have three

1471
01:23:11,168 --> 01:23:14,346
ants interacting or 300 ants and

1472
01:23:14,368 --> 01:23:17,690
then the nested composability,

1473
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:20,106
you could have the fifth and the 7th and

1474
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,694
all those layers with computational

1475
01:23:22,742 --> 01:23:24,454
trade offs, maybe with no extra

1476
01:23:24,512 --> 01:23:26,942
information to be gleaned. And then

1477
01:23:27,076 --> 01:23:29,562
learning the structure of the generative

1478
01:23:29,626 --> 01:23:31,486
model or just the structure of the

1479
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,838
partition more broadly and like what the

1480
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:36,146
variables are and everything that's the

1481
01:23:36,168 --> 01:23:40,260
structure. Learning challenge and

1482
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:42,900
cognition as structured learning.

1483
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,420
Hashtag synergetics geometry of thought

1484
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,742
is what Friston has and others have

1485
01:23:50,796 --> 01:23:54,822
raised as like a total open area because

1486
01:23:54,876 --> 01:23:57,702
there's the parameter fine tuning once

1487
01:23:57,756 --> 01:24:01,500
you have the Bayes graph. So then

1488
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,700
you're now inside of the ability to

1489
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:08,346
reify or not that model. You're just

1490
01:24:08,368 --> 01:24:11,322
doing parameter optimization. We used

1491
01:24:11,376 --> 01:24:13,190
two factors in this linear regression

1492
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:14,814
and then we optimized it with the L two

1493
01:24:14,852 --> 01:24:18,106
norm. Two is the best number of factors,

1494
01:24:18,298 --> 01:24:21,850
but it couldn't be set at that scale.

1495
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:24,046
You could say in a two parameter model,

1496
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:26,594
this is the best parameters with this

1497
01:24:26,632 --> 01:24:29,554
norm, but then you couldn't pull back

1498
01:24:29,592 --> 01:24:33,166
another level. And so that's like meta

1499
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:36,530
scientific and metabasian analyses,

1500
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,960
which they're going to talk about later.

1501
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,826
Okay, I guess I'm also kind of wondering

1502
01:24:45,858 --> 01:24:47,846
if there are any examples that come to

1503
01:24:47,868 --> 01:24:50,006
mind of something like a system that is

1504
01:24:50,028 --> 01:24:52,646
structured. Such as the clearest or

1505
01:24:52,668 --> 01:24:53,938
simplest example that comes to mind is

1506
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,382
like, let's say that you have a nation

1507
01:24:55,526 --> 01:24:58,314
and a state within that nation and there

1508
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:01,354
is a port and there is an overlap of

1509
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:03,126
sort of that port interface to an

1510
01:25:03,168 --> 01:25:05,534
outside structure that is shared by both

1511
01:25:05,572 --> 01:25:07,754
the national and overlapping national

1512
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:09,754
and state interests and decision

1513
01:25:09,802 --> 01:25:13,246
processes. And so I'm kind of curious if

1514
01:25:13,268 --> 01:25:15,746
there are examples of demonstrating that

1515
01:25:15,768 --> 01:25:17,294
kind of composability of generative

1516
01:25:17,342 --> 01:25:19,486
models or if that's something that's

1517
01:25:19,518 --> 01:25:21,780
still just new and open.

1518
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:26,226
Those are awesome questions. If people

1519
01:25:26,408 --> 01:25:30,606
know any some areas to investigate,

1520
01:25:30,718 --> 01:25:33,210
like in the phenomena that you're

1521
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:36,646
overlapping interests informally, there

1522
01:25:36,668 --> 01:25:38,326
would be like shared regimes of

1523
01:25:38,348 --> 01:25:40,306
attention. There's the question of

1524
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:43,020
synchrony and that doesn't mean like

1525
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:46,666
synchronization identically but

1526
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:48,490
generalized synchrony.

1527
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:51,786
Then there's like coordination of

1528
01:25:51,808 --> 01:25:55,614
affordances. We're not going

1529
01:25:55,652 --> 01:25:58,346
to do this because of that. So that's

1530
01:25:58,378 --> 01:26:01,946
like in an area that Yaako

1531
01:26:01,978 --> 01:26:04,302
and others have been working on is just

1532
01:26:04,356 --> 01:26:07,374
describing that situation as an

1533
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,766
affordance on an affordance or like E

1534
01:26:10,788 --> 01:26:14,386
sub E. It's not in the textbook. But if

1535
01:26:14,408 --> 01:26:15,826
people are staying this long then this

1536
01:26:15,848 --> 01:26:17,266
is just kind of some ways that some

1537
01:26:17,288 --> 01:26:19,118
people are thinking about it. And these

1538
01:26:19,144 --> 01:26:20,934
are the areas where people can also do

1539
01:26:20,972 --> 01:26:23,560
research and learning with us. But

1540
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,070
affordances on affordances,

1541
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:29,766
the safety could be on or off. So then

1542
01:26:29,788 --> 01:26:31,334
there's like an affordance that modifies

1543
01:26:31,382 --> 01:26:34,540
another affordance and could those have

1544
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:38,234
compositionality just like some of these

1545
01:26:38,272 --> 01:26:41,690
other generalization

1546
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,770
affordances for generalization

1547
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,974
basically, what are those? And then

1548
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:48,734
isn't it like discovering what those

1549
01:26:48,772 --> 01:26:49,360
are?

1550
01:26:57,150 --> 01:27:00,746
Just I think it's

1551
01:27:00,778 --> 01:27:02,974
kind of also related to that question of

1552
01:27:03,012 --> 01:27:04,958
this formation evolution, collapse of

1553
01:27:04,964 --> 01:27:08,830
markup blankets is when does the

1554
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:14,260
observation and actions of one system

1555
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:17,906
map to the

1556
01:27:17,928 --> 01:27:20,382
preferences of another and vice versa?

1557
01:27:20,446 --> 01:27:25,158
How does that come into being

1558
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:27,190
existence? How does that start to happen

1559
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:30,920
and how does it unhappy? I don't know.

1560
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:35,222
Awesome question. Thank you. And another

1561
01:27:35,356 --> 01:27:38,518
angle on that, let me just check and

1562
01:27:38,524 --> 01:27:40,858
then Ali is like this is a graph that

1563
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:42,442
we're going to look at a ton and we will

1564
01:27:42,496 --> 01:27:45,226
interpret what all of it means. What is

1565
01:27:45,248 --> 01:27:48,010
the OASB, pi, g,

1566
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,466
et cetera. But this

1567
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:53,518
is a basing graph like Eric mentioned.

1568
01:27:53,604 --> 01:27:55,354
And the edges are like dependencies,

1569
01:27:55,482 --> 01:27:57,742
not causal influences in the world, but

1570
01:27:57,796 --> 01:27:59,614
apparent potentially or different

1571
01:27:59,652 --> 01:28:02,130
interpretations. Is this the only

1572
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,906
skeleton? No, this is

1573
01:28:05,928 --> 01:28:08,850
the Y equals MX plus b of skeletons.

1574
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:12,498
And there's the linear regression in the

1575
01:28:12,504 --> 01:28:14,338
first equation in the textbook of the

1576
01:28:14,344 --> 01:28:16,486
stats textbook. And then there's all

1577
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:19,174
these accessory tests. Then there's like

1578
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:22,230
creation and destruction as applied.

1579
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,546
Maybe there can just be a loop that's

1580
01:28:24,578 --> 01:28:26,034
not active inference, just checking

1581
01:28:26,082 --> 01:28:27,754
every day if something's within an

1582
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:30,634
arbitrary threshold. So there could be

1583
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:35,386
some liminal or gray area like

1584
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:37,846
an interface. I think steven Solette

1585
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:39,246
mentioned it as like a nail bed or

1586
01:28:39,268 --> 01:28:41,502
something, like an interface between

1587
01:28:41,556 --> 01:28:43,198
more particulate and then less

1588
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:46,606
particulate, more field versus the

1589
01:28:46,628 --> 01:28:48,590
particle. Ali.

1590
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:54,210
Well, as a little side note,

1591
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:57,522
there's a popular science book coming

1592
01:28:57,576 --> 01:29:00,686
out, I think in June, namely The Romance

1593
01:29:00,718 --> 01:29:04,438
of Reality by Bobby Azerian, which

1594
01:29:04,604 --> 01:29:08,294
touches on the

1595
01:29:08,332 --> 01:29:11,414
emergence of Markup blankets, the

1596
01:29:11,452 --> 01:29:14,354
dynamics of emergence of Markup

1597
01:29:14,402 --> 01:29:19,718
blankets. And it attacks

1598
01:29:19,734 --> 01:29:22,166
it from many different angles,

1599
01:29:22,278 --> 01:29:25,466
evolutionary angle, I mean, from a

1600
01:29:25,488 --> 01:29:29,434
cosmic, even perspective. And it

1601
01:29:29,472 --> 01:29:33,694
even goes as far

1602
01:29:33,732 --> 01:29:37,854
as well, considering the

1603
01:29:37,892 --> 01:29:41,360
whole cosmos, the whole universe, as,

1604
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:47,274
let's say, a kind of Metamark

1605
01:29:47,322 --> 01:29:51,026
of blanket, so to speak. And well,

1606
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:54,866
I think that could be an

1607
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:58,066
interesting thought put forward

1608
01:29:58,168 --> 01:30:00,118
by Bob Yadarian in this book. All right.

1609
01:30:00,124 --> 01:30:01,110
Thanks, Daniel.

1610
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:06,514
Thanks. In fact, he gave part one of

1611
01:30:06,572 --> 01:30:09,466
what was intended and may still be like

1612
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,770
a multiple part discussion,

1613
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,282
but this was him giving that

1614
01:30:14,336 --> 01:30:18,266
presentation. So we

1615
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,886
were in contact is definitely an

1616
01:30:19,908 --> 01:30:22,782
interesting view. And it's going to take

1617
01:30:22,836 --> 01:30:26,814
all kinds of research and education and

1618
01:30:26,852 --> 01:30:29,390
communication. Jessica.

1619
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:37,598
Yes. I guess first,

1620
01:30:37,684 --> 01:30:41,566
join the lab. Some of the ideas

1621
01:30:41,598 --> 01:30:44,998
that helped me a little bit to start

1622
01:30:45,084 --> 01:30:48,280
even conceptualizing this,

1623
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:50,806
in addition to the filter that you

1624
01:30:50,828 --> 01:30:54,406
mentioned before, Daniel, and how it

1625
01:30:54,428 --> 01:30:58,122
could be more like porous or more hard

1626
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,714
and allow things in and out, but it was

1627
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:03,866
also about it could

1628
01:31:03,888 --> 01:31:06,406
be like just grouping of relationships

1629
01:31:06,518 --> 01:31:08,486
and interactions. So, like, the closer

1630
01:31:08,518 --> 01:31:10,862
like a relationship, like different

1631
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:13,646
things are, maybe that's more like on

1632
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:16,670
biological systems, I don't know if

1633
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,710
they're closely related or they have

1634
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,358
more interactions, even though they

1635
01:31:21,364 --> 01:31:24,066
might be different, but grouping it in

1636
01:31:24,088 --> 01:31:26,546
those sense and maybe that relates to

1637
01:31:26,568 --> 01:31:29,630
what Eric said from the calculational

1638
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,978
part. But that was sort of like some of

1639
01:31:32,984 --> 01:31:35,374
the things where I started connecting

1640
01:31:35,502 --> 01:31:37,300
Marco blankets to.

1641
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:42,834
Okay, if items

1642
01:31:42,882 --> 01:31:45,286
or different objects and things like

1643
01:31:45,388 --> 01:31:48,486
they're closely related, you can start

1644
01:31:48,588 --> 01:31:52,266
putting a blanket around and

1645
01:31:52,288 --> 01:31:53,882
maybe go through with the idea of

1646
01:31:53,936 --> 01:31:57,626
wrapping things from some of

1647
01:31:57,648 --> 01:31:59,306
the definitions. But, yeah, those are

1648
01:31:59,328 --> 01:32:01,306
kind of like the kind of visual ideas

1649
01:32:01,338 --> 01:32:04,638
that started helping me a little bit

1650
01:32:04,724 --> 01:32:06,346
and I still don't understand properly,

1651
01:32:06,378 --> 01:32:08,206
but those are the things I was like,

1652
01:32:08,228 --> 01:32:10,910
okay, so relationships, filters,

1653
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:15,598
kind of like connecting interactions

1654
01:32:15,774 --> 01:32:16,980
between things.

1655
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:22,642
Awesome. Thanks a lot for that. Like

1656
01:32:22,776 --> 01:32:26,280
interacting entities. So you could

1657
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:28,710
have the edges representing some

1658
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,286
interaction, like when people are

1659
01:32:31,308 --> 01:32:33,314
fitting a linear model. Interacting

1660
01:32:33,362 --> 01:32:36,166
variables. So there's this whole

1661
01:32:36,348 --> 01:32:38,346
discussion topic of whether the

1662
01:32:38,368 --> 01:32:40,326
interactions are like the two ants

1663
01:32:40,358 --> 01:32:42,426
bumping into each other, whatever that

1664
01:32:42,448 --> 01:32:44,586
means in the, quote, real world. And

1665
01:32:44,608 --> 01:32:45,942
then there's like the statistical

1666
01:32:46,006 --> 01:32:49,850
interaction. So then defining

1667
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:52,234
certain variables in statistical models.

1668
01:32:52,282 --> 01:32:54,686
So leaving that debate behind us and

1669
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,074
just talking about the statistical

1670
01:32:56,122 --> 01:32:58,670
models that we have, Bayesian graphs,

1671
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:02,194
some variables have edges between them

1672
01:33:02,312 --> 01:33:04,706
that could be either designed to be

1673
01:33:04,728 --> 01:33:07,298
there or not. Or you could do some sort

1674
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:09,042
of like thresholding. Approach and

1675
01:33:09,096 --> 01:33:10,942
explore that your thresholding parameter

1676
01:33:11,006 --> 01:33:14,654
was acceptable. But the more of a loose

1677
01:33:14,702 --> 01:33:17,318
interaction you allow, the more

1678
01:33:17,404 --> 01:33:18,742
challenge there is to fit that

1679
01:33:18,796 --> 01:33:21,206
statistical model. And you may not have

1680
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:23,346
enough data to fit like the ten variable

1681
01:33:23,378 --> 01:33:25,506
by ten variable with all the interaction

1682
01:33:25,538 --> 01:33:27,674
terms which is like why when doing

1683
01:33:27,712 --> 01:33:30,966
linear modeling in a health population

1684
01:33:31,078 --> 01:33:33,370
example they would like do model

1685
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,182
selection on what their statistical

1686
01:33:36,246 --> 01:33:39,702
power is with that data set to resolve

1687
01:33:39,766 --> 01:33:41,146
certain kinds of effects and

1688
01:33:41,168 --> 01:33:43,774
correlations and non sphericities. And

1689
01:33:43,812 --> 01:33:47,630
that is addressed a lot in the SPM

1690
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:51,422
textbook and Kristen's earlier pre

1691
01:33:51,476 --> 01:33:55,426
active work. But then you mentioned how

1692
01:33:55,448 --> 01:33:58,658
to be engaged with that process of the

1693
01:33:58,664 --> 01:34:01,298
wrapping or the seeing the clusters and

1694
01:34:01,304 --> 01:34:02,754
then knowing where is there going to be

1695
01:34:02,792 --> 01:34:05,960
maybe generative models arising that are

1696
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,726
consisting of other generative models or

1697
01:34:08,748 --> 01:34:11,046
other generative processes? And then

1698
01:34:11,148 --> 01:34:13,080
some things interact more with others

1699
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:17,050
statistically in a model as by design or

1700
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,820
just as an outcome of whatever.

1701
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:22,726
So there's sparse connectivity amongst

1702
01:34:22,758 --> 01:34:24,554
the variables. They're not like all by

1703
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:27,238
all connected. And then that sparse

1704
01:34:27,254 --> 01:34:29,398
connectivity simplifies a lot of things

1705
01:34:29,504 --> 01:34:31,354
that's also related to like a Lasso

1706
01:34:31,402 --> 01:34:35,214
regression and also to the below l two

1707
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:38,206
norms and then a sparse model can be

1708
01:34:38,228 --> 01:34:41,306
factorized. And that is what allows for

1709
01:34:41,348 --> 01:34:43,454
the variational Bayesian inference,

1710
01:34:43,582 --> 01:34:45,522
which is like doing Bayesian model

1711
01:34:45,576 --> 01:34:49,166
fitting on a factorized because it's

1712
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:52,466
sparsely connected graph and

1713
01:34:52,488 --> 01:34:54,918
so a lot of these discussions are quite

1714
01:34:55,084 --> 01:34:58,214
downstream of a lot of the philosophy of

1715
01:34:58,252 --> 01:35:00,246
map and territory. But it's still a

1716
01:35:00,268 --> 01:35:02,934
super important conversation. However,

1717
01:35:03,052 --> 01:35:05,622
within the model inference, with a model

1718
01:35:05,676 --> 01:35:09,402
inference using a model, a lot of these

1719
01:35:09,456 --> 01:35:12,250
questions are very technical and

1720
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,654
downstream of importance qualitative

1721
01:35:15,702 --> 01:35:17,146
things that are also important to keep

1722
01:35:17,168 --> 01:35:20,558
in mind but of a

1723
01:35:20,564 --> 01:35:21,440
different type,

1724
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:28,080
jessica or anyone else.

1725
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:33,060
Yeah. Wow, very interesting.

1726
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,450
Here's one other question I guess we can

1727
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,262
discuss. Like as the as it currently

1728
01:35:44,316 --> 01:35:46,806
stands, there's a 1 hour meeting and

1729
01:35:46,828 --> 01:35:48,006
then at the end of the hour, the very

1730
01:35:48,028 --> 01:35:51,538
next hour begins the Tools regular

1731
01:35:51,634 --> 01:35:53,510
organizational unit meeting.

1732
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:59,418
It is the people who are here now but

1733
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,938
hopefully others would be listening to

1734
01:36:00,944 --> 01:36:02,186
it if they're not able to make this

1735
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:05,642
time. But what will help

1736
01:36:05,696 --> 01:36:07,306
people with the synchronous and

1737
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:10,814
Asynchronous make the most of the next

1738
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,734
few months? Do people appreciate having

1739
01:36:14,772 --> 01:36:18,160
a longer discussion for this?

1740
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:22,226
Do people think that the main versus the

1741
01:36:22,248 --> 01:36:25,822
math group? Is there another subgroup,

1742
01:36:25,886 --> 01:36:27,506
like a philosophy discussion, that

1743
01:36:27,528 --> 01:36:31,700
people want to kind of really do this?

1744
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:36,806
Because we're experimenting with

1745
01:36:36,828 --> 01:36:39,334
open endedness on our first cohort and

1746
01:36:39,372 --> 01:36:42,582
in these early phases of the book and

1747
01:36:42,716 --> 01:36:44,582
people can probably imagine various of

1748
01:36:44,636 --> 01:36:46,134
the things we want to balance, like

1749
01:36:46,172 --> 01:36:48,682
respecting everyone's time and different

1750
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:49,914
backgrounds, respecting their

1751
01:36:49,952 --> 01:36:53,146
preferences for how much they want to

1752
01:36:53,168 --> 01:36:55,594
learn about different topics. Being

1753
01:36:55,632 --> 01:36:58,246
realistic about how much asynchronous

1754
01:36:58,278 --> 01:37:02,186
and synchronous, direct and peripheral

1755
01:37:02,378 --> 01:37:05,214
time makes sense. But also being

1756
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,658
realistic like there isn't a two minute

1757
01:37:07,674 --> 01:37:11,646
video for a process. So how

1758
01:37:11,668 --> 01:37:15,346
do people think about that, those who

1759
01:37:15,368 --> 01:37:19,140
have stayed this far?

1760
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,590
Mike and then anyone else?

1761
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,750
Can you hear me? Yes. Okay.

1762
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:55,148
Yeah. I think that as noted earlier in

1763
01:37:55,154 --> 01:37:56,672
the discussion, there are just so many

1764
01:37:56,726 --> 01:37:59,696
themes that run through this that there

1765
01:37:59,718 --> 01:38:02,608
are opportunities to pull on any of a

1766
01:38:02,614 --> 01:38:04,144
number of threads in the course of

1767
01:38:04,182 --> 01:38:07,504
discussion. And so today's discussion

1768
01:38:07,552 --> 01:38:10,436
was interesting and I stayed for this

1769
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:14,256
part of the discussion simply

1770
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:16,788
because of the interesting threads that

1771
01:38:16,794 --> 01:38:19,972
were being pulled. Certainly a contrast

1772
01:38:20,036 --> 01:38:21,828
with the first part of the discussion

1773
01:38:21,924 --> 01:38:23,816
around math and I think a lot of

1774
01:38:23,838 --> 01:38:26,970
uncertainty amongst the attendees about

1775
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,412
how to engage with the mathematical

1776
01:38:29,476 --> 01:38:33,276
aspects. Maybe to try and put

1777
01:38:33,298 --> 01:38:36,684
a point on it, from my

1778
01:38:36,722 --> 01:38:40,444
perspective, learning about what

1779
01:38:40,482 --> 01:38:42,328
is active inference and how can active

1780
01:38:42,344 --> 01:38:44,720
inference be applied in real world

1781
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:47,936
situations is a motivator for me

1782
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:51,456
participating. Obviously there

1783
01:38:51,478 --> 01:38:54,064
are also sort of philosophical and maybe

1784
01:38:54,102 --> 01:38:56,484
more scientific discussions that can

1785
01:38:56,522 --> 01:38:57,350
take place.

1786
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,372
Any meeting could touch on any of those

1787
01:39:04,426 --> 01:39:06,996
aspects as well as some of the

1788
01:39:07,018 --> 01:39:08,904
asynchronous interaction could pick

1789
01:39:08,942 --> 01:39:10,170
those up as well.

1790
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,864
Thanks a lot. Okay. Anyone can

1791
01:39:15,902 --> 01:39:17,752
raise their hand here's just a few other

1792
01:39:17,886 --> 01:39:19,348
options. Like if somebody here's

1793
01:39:19,364 --> 01:39:20,724
something that's interesting to them,

1794
01:39:20,862 --> 01:39:24,350
we can in the discord make a channel

1795
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,976
that is relate or people can participate

1796
01:39:28,008 --> 01:39:29,612
in the regular channels just like

1797
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:32,524
questions that's going to potentially be

1798
01:39:32,642 --> 01:39:34,488
seen and interacted with by people more

1799
01:39:34,514 --> 01:39:36,524
broadly. Like what if we posted

1800
01:39:36,572 --> 01:39:39,328
questions that we're having we're in the

1801
01:39:39,334 --> 01:39:41,584
cohort one of the text and we had this

1802
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:45,088
question do you know that's one option?

1803
01:39:45,174 --> 01:39:48,340
Another, and this is like to Mike's

1804
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,184
expression that applied active inference

1805
01:39:51,232 --> 01:39:55,072
is a motivator epistemic and pragmatic

1806
01:39:55,136 --> 01:39:58,356
value, expected epistemic value. We

1807
01:39:58,378 --> 01:40:00,696
expect to learn a lot by like staying in

1808
01:40:00,718 --> 01:40:04,964
these sometimes challenging

1809
01:40:05,012 --> 01:40:07,784
or oblique or whatever discussions. But

1810
01:40:07,822 --> 01:40:09,412
then there's also expected pragmatic

1811
01:40:09,476 --> 01:40:12,264
value with applying active inference,

1812
01:40:12,392 --> 01:40:14,460
learning and applying active inference.

1813
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,252
So then maybe that is a group

1814
01:40:18,306 --> 01:40:22,344
we can partition, like an applied

1815
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:26,480
active inference group. So then we can

1816
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:28,572
be clear about what the focal artifact

1817
01:40:28,636 --> 01:40:32,930
is because also we want to not

1818
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,116
all groups at all times will be able to

1819
01:40:36,138 --> 01:40:40,064
have nor is it useful to have open ended

1820
01:40:40,112 --> 01:40:42,580
discussions of any discursion length.

1821
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,452
So like knowing how far and in what ways

1822
01:40:46,506 --> 01:40:48,372
and how many minutes of people's linear

1823
01:40:48,436 --> 01:40:52,570
time. Ali yes,

1824
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,628
the meetings, just one note

1825
01:40:56,644 --> 01:40:58,468
on the organizational unit meetings.

1826
01:40:58,564 --> 01:41:01,244
The organization units in the active lab

1827
01:41:01,282 --> 01:41:04,396
like comms and tools for education,

1828
01:41:04,498 --> 01:41:06,908
communication and tools are like

1829
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:10,460
directory 1 hour lab

1830
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:13,788
meetings or group meetings because we're

1831
01:41:13,804 --> 01:41:16,652
not doing the education work necessarily

1832
01:41:16,716 --> 01:41:18,492
in that 1 hour. But some groups

1833
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:19,984
sometimes it's possible to do some

1834
01:41:20,022 --> 01:41:23,360
stuff, but it's like increasingly moving

1835
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:26,996
towards sharing updates from people who

1836
01:41:27,018 --> 01:41:29,092
want to commit in Asynchronous work or

1837
01:41:29,146 --> 01:41:30,996
smaller groups that want to commit to

1838
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:33,750
doing something like that. So then

1839
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,816
educational related projects, that's

1840
01:41:36,848 --> 01:41:38,552
their opportunity to ask for help,

1841
01:41:38,606 --> 01:41:40,810
share updates and so on.

1842
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:45,092
But earlier on there was more topical

1843
01:41:45,156 --> 01:41:48,488
material, but then through

1844
01:41:48,654 --> 01:41:52,220
particularization and operations and

1845
01:41:52,290 --> 01:41:55,116
other approaches, it becomes more like

1846
01:41:55,138 --> 01:41:57,804
Pragmatic and less discovery and less

1847
01:41:57,842 --> 01:42:00,444
mixed media role specification, all

1848
01:42:00,482 --> 01:42:03,736
these processes. So people sticking

1849
01:42:03,768 --> 01:42:06,436
around is sort of the and being engaged

1850
01:42:06,488 --> 01:42:08,096
and like seeing an affordance and then

1851
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:11,116
just making that contribution, wanting

1852
01:42:11,148 --> 01:42:12,624
to be a facilitator for a certain

1853
01:42:12,662 --> 01:42:13,996
project or wanting to contribute

1854
01:42:14,028 --> 01:42:15,536
actively or just even connect with

1855
01:42:15,558 --> 01:42:19,108
another participant. You can email

1856
01:42:19,194 --> 01:42:20,692
them if they've provided their

1857
01:42:20,746 --> 01:42:25,012
information, just some

1858
01:42:25,146 --> 01:42:28,664
random things. But we want to have

1859
01:42:28,702 --> 01:42:31,332
the applied angle, the philosophical

1860
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:35,048
loop and how to even partition that

1861
01:42:35,134 --> 01:42:38,824
discussion. Like we couldn't just

1862
01:42:38,862 --> 01:42:41,224
overgo every math, every philosophy,

1863
01:42:41,272 --> 01:42:44,796
every applied question and have the

1864
01:42:44,818 --> 01:42:47,388
judge and the jury and all this

1865
01:42:47,474 --> 01:42:48,620
apparatus.

1866
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,044
So how can we scaffold that conversation

1867
01:42:54,092 --> 01:42:56,016
around applied active inference for the

1868
01:42:56,038 --> 01:42:57,536
people who are like super excited and

1869
01:42:57,558 --> 01:42:59,120
motivated? Mike?

1870
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:03,456
Yeah. I just want to add there's an

1871
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:06,116
interesting duality related to what you

1872
01:43:06,218 --> 01:43:08,932
just said in that we can't go into fine

1873
01:43:08,986 --> 01:43:12,916
detail in all of the content and at

1874
01:43:12,938 --> 01:43:16,084
the same time, I've found this group to

1875
01:43:16,122 --> 01:43:19,000
be remarkable at unpacking things and

1876
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:22,936
sort of really getting into what do we

1877
01:43:22,958 --> 01:43:25,640
mean when we say that? Types of

1878
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:28,584
discussions and what does this term mean

1879
01:43:28,622 --> 01:43:31,884
not taking things for granted as going

1880
01:43:31,922 --> 01:43:35,304
through the text. There's a balance

1881
01:43:35,352 --> 01:43:38,316
to be struck in taking that approach of

1882
01:43:38,498 --> 01:43:40,024
asking what do we mean when we're

1883
01:43:40,072 --> 01:43:42,076
talking about this and putting nouns on

1884
01:43:42,098 --> 01:43:46,288
things and relating it to language and

1885
01:43:46,374 --> 01:43:48,912
not going too far over into getting into

1886
01:43:48,966 --> 01:43:50,530
fine detail about things.

1887
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:59,846
Thank you, Lyle. And then I'll leave

1888
01:43:59,868 --> 01:44:02,022
with your question. Yeah, this firstly

1889
01:44:02,086 --> 01:44:03,162
great session, really great

1890
01:44:03,216 --> 01:44:06,778
conversation, I really enjoy it. Most of

1891
01:44:06,784 --> 01:44:09,638
this is new material for me and so I'm

1892
01:44:09,654 --> 01:44:11,086
really enjoying the breadth of the

1893
01:44:11,108 --> 01:44:14,286
conversation and I'm cognizant of this

1894
01:44:14,468 --> 01:44:16,894
aspect you're digging into is how much

1895
01:44:16,932 --> 01:44:19,402
do we sort of separate out the pieces

1896
01:44:19,466 --> 01:44:21,546
and go deep dive in different places

1897
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:25,054
versus more of touching on multiple

1898
01:44:25,102 --> 01:44:28,818
threads and their interactions? For me,

1899
01:44:28,904 --> 01:44:31,138
while I understand there is a balance to

1900
01:44:31,144 --> 01:44:35,480
be struck there, I'm really enjoying the

1901
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:38,598
challenge of relating as an example,

1902
01:44:38,684 --> 01:44:42,502
the math to the philosophy, to all these

1903
01:44:42,556 --> 01:44:45,446
different threads together because they

1904
01:44:45,468 --> 01:44:49,482
are linked. Right. I do

1905
01:44:49,536 --> 01:44:53,514
understand that some

1906
01:44:53,552 --> 01:44:56,682
of those areas need a separate group

1907
01:44:56,736 --> 01:44:58,842
that you can drill down into for me

1908
01:44:58,896 --> 01:45:00,778
personally. And so this may be not the

1909
01:45:00,784 --> 01:45:02,714
same as other people in the group. I'm

1910
01:45:02,762 --> 01:45:04,462
really enjoying understanding the

1911
01:45:04,516 --> 01:45:07,694
connections, the philosophy, how these

1912
01:45:07,732 --> 01:45:09,694
different thought process came to be

1913
01:45:09,732 --> 01:45:11,886
through history and get that depth of

1914
01:45:11,908 --> 01:45:15,282
understanding. Thank you,

1915
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:18,660
Lyle. And for those who want to listen

1916
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:22,802
or view, these live streams have many,

1917
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:25,906
many themes. So check if there's papers

1918
01:45:25,938 --> 01:45:28,662
that you're interested in here. The live

1919
01:45:28,716 --> 01:45:32,294
streams is about papers, so there's 46

1920
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:35,526
papers. Guest streams are not driven by

1921
01:45:35,548 --> 01:45:36,946
a paper. Sometimes the person is sharing

1922
01:45:36,978 --> 01:45:38,374
a paper. But these are like

1923
01:45:38,412 --> 01:45:40,794
presentations, hearing from different

1924
01:45:40,832 --> 01:45:42,762
perspectives. And if anybody wants to

1925
01:45:42,896 --> 01:45:45,098
help organize these, that's what we do

1926
01:45:45,104 --> 01:45:47,354
in comms. If they want to facilitate and

1927
01:45:47,392 --> 01:45:49,066
participate in these discussions, if

1928
01:45:49,088 --> 01:45:51,178
they want to contact authors, recommend

1929
01:45:51,264 --> 01:45:54,122
papers, these are all distributed tasks

1930
01:45:54,186 --> 01:45:56,686
that are leverage points for people who

1931
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,614
care to just do a ton of amazing things.

1932
01:45:59,732 --> 01:46:01,374
Like if somebody's interested to connect

1933
01:46:01,412 --> 01:46:04,206
it to a given community and make an

1934
01:46:04,228 --> 01:46:06,266
artifact or a live stream co organize

1935
01:46:06,298 --> 01:46:09,362
that, we can catalyze it at the lab

1936
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:11,826
scale for individuals who know about the

1937
01:46:11,848 --> 01:46:13,634
affordance but then want to take that

1938
01:46:13,672 --> 01:46:17,574
affordance to just have really

1939
01:46:17,772 --> 01:46:20,706
leveraged impacts in the active

1940
01:46:20,818 --> 01:46:23,686
ecosystem. So, ali's question and then

1941
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:30,504
jessica sorry.

1942
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:32,456
I don't have any questions you asked.

1943
01:46:32,478 --> 01:46:35,300
About the timetable for the meetings,

1944
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,016
like what specific times are they

1945
01:46:37,038 --> 01:46:38,010
occurring at?

1946
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:44,364
Sure. Yeah. Okay. They are on Mondays at

1947
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:47,740
13 and 23 UTC.

1948
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,868
There's two meetings to reflect, like

1949
01:46:51,954 --> 01:46:54,492
education being the primary mission of

1950
01:46:54,546 --> 01:46:57,136
ActInf lab, and then that spreads them

1951
01:46:57,158 --> 01:46:59,952
out by time zones. But if somebody

1952
01:47:00,006 --> 01:47:02,530
really wants to contribute to an area,

1953
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,392
the organizational unit meeting is not

1954
01:47:05,446 --> 01:47:07,872
the rate limiting step. Anyone who has

1955
01:47:07,926 --> 01:47:10,276
attention to contribute will be able to

1956
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:12,452
find a regime of attention that is

1957
01:47:12,506 --> 01:47:14,288
connected to a task that's meaningful.

1958
01:47:14,384 --> 01:47:16,384
The rate limiting step is not people's

1959
01:47:16,432 --> 01:47:19,700
availability for a 1 hour meeting.

1960
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,768
It's however much time people want to

1961
01:47:21,774 --> 01:47:23,384
contribute. Whatever practices and

1962
01:47:23,422 --> 01:47:25,784
things will find something that works

1963
01:47:25,822 --> 01:47:28,040
for people who want to be engaged. So

1964
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,072
don't take these meeting times as being

1965
01:47:30,126 --> 01:47:32,888
like when we're doing it, when we're

1966
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:36,236
deciding. Even anybody who wants

1967
01:47:36,258 --> 01:47:38,652
to can email or contact just the lab

1968
01:47:38,706 --> 01:47:42,440
email address and be started on figuring

1969
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,470
that out.

1970
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:45,680
Jessica.

1971
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,752
Yes. This was related to the question

1972
01:47:50,806 --> 01:47:53,520
about applied projects.

1973
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:56,416
I was thinking that maybe one thing that

1974
01:47:56,438 --> 01:48:00,820
we could do is on the project ideas

1975
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,350
to have a table where people can

1976
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,676
briefly share what they want to do or

1977
01:48:08,858 --> 01:48:11,530
just say, okay, I'm interested in

1978
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:15,156
machine learning and apply active

1979
01:48:15,188 --> 01:48:18,040
inference and maybe this specific topic.

1980
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:21,652
Who will be interested in discussing

1981
01:48:21,716 --> 01:48:24,796
this or exploring what to do and then

1982
01:48:24,898 --> 01:48:27,084
adding the names of the people who will

1983
01:48:27,122 --> 01:48:30,044
be interested in that. So the person who

1984
01:48:30,082 --> 01:48:35,176
started the project, then they can

1985
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:37,344
start maybe contacting those people and

1986
01:48:37,382 --> 01:48:40,256
see what time they can meet and start

1987
01:48:40,358 --> 01:48:42,576
creating their own subgroups. So maybe

1988
01:48:42,598 --> 01:48:43,936
that's something that we could do to

1989
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:47,890
facilitate that in a simple way.

1990
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:52,036
So just start saying, this is what I

1991
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,032
would like to do. Apply active inference

1992
01:48:54,096 --> 01:48:57,396
while also studying the course. And we

1993
01:48:57,418 --> 01:48:59,248
like to connect with people here who

1994
01:48:59,274 --> 01:49:02,952
might share the same interest and see

1995
01:49:03,086 --> 01:49:05,864
what kind of feedback that person can

1996
01:49:05,902 --> 01:49:08,490
get. Thanks.

1997
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:12,220
And just connecting and building

1998
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:15,164
trust and having like a buddy system or

1999
01:49:15,202 --> 01:49:18,892
small groups or just people who are on

2000
01:49:18,946 --> 01:49:22,460
the relatively long path to apply

2001
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:24,620
active inference on teams.

2002
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:28,860
We don't have the speed dating hot swap

2003
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:33,488
activation protocol but

2004
01:49:33,654 --> 01:49:38,068
connecting with people. And then however

2005
01:49:38,154 --> 01:49:40,036
it's authentic in that relationship.

2006
01:49:40,218 --> 01:49:42,564
Seeing what you're interested in in

2007
01:49:42,602 --> 01:49:45,252
three months will be in a pretty

2008
01:49:45,306 --> 01:49:48,576
different situation, but we still won't

2009
01:49:48,608 --> 01:49:51,112
have even gone through the second half

2010
01:49:51,166 --> 01:49:55,144
of the book on the application of

2011
01:49:55,182 --> 01:49:58,504
the textbook. So there's a lot of

2012
01:49:58,542 --> 01:50:02,600
time for us to develop ideas

2013
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,510
and to connect with each other.

2014
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,084
So thanks for sharing that a lot.

2015
01:50:09,122 --> 01:50:11,580
Jessica and I tagged you so that we can

2016
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:14,956
create a table with the right way or do

2017
01:50:14,978 --> 01:50:18,368
it however is the right way because it

2018
01:50:18,374 --> 01:50:20,544
helps enable connections for people who

2019
01:50:20,582 --> 01:50:24,320
want to connect around applying.

2020
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:28,310
And also it helps us remember these are

2021
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,396
the specific reference points in the

2022
01:50:31,418 --> 01:50:35,190
text that are like

2023
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:39,476
our attractor regime of attention for

2024
01:50:39,498 --> 01:50:42,064
this textbook group. Like the textbook

2025
01:50:42,112 --> 01:50:43,736
group isn't all of active flap. If

2026
01:50:43,758 --> 01:50:45,460
people want to apply active inference,

2027
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,036
it doesn't have to be from the ground

2028
01:50:48,068 --> 01:50:50,756
up, but it totally could be. But there's

2029
01:50:50,788 --> 01:50:52,236
many ways to apply that are just in

2030
01:50:52,258 --> 01:50:54,476
different codas that people can get

2031
01:50:54,498 --> 01:50:55,980
involved in immediately.

2032
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,696
So if somebody feels

2033
01:51:00,728 --> 01:51:02,030
like doing things,

2034
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,376
I hope they feel like they have the

2035
01:51:05,398 --> 01:51:06,930
agency to do that.

2036
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:12,352
Okay, any final thoughts on this

2037
01:51:12,406 --> 01:51:15,916
interesting semi

2038
01:51:15,948 --> 01:51:19,750
pattern breaking? And also

2039
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,164
yes, one final thought for me is we

2040
01:51:24,202 --> 01:51:26,976
would have had tools organizational unit

2041
01:51:27,008 --> 01:51:29,204
meeting at this time, which is why near

2042
01:51:29,242 --> 01:51:31,992
the end I asked if you want to do

2043
01:51:32,046 --> 01:51:36,584
different scheduling because in

2044
01:51:36,622 --> 01:51:38,932
general it's probably not good practice

2045
01:51:38,996 --> 01:51:43,624
or ways of working to go overtime to

2046
01:51:43,662 --> 01:51:45,484
respect everyone's time and all of these

2047
01:51:45,522 --> 01:51:47,852
types of things. But also in the future

2048
01:51:47,906 --> 01:51:50,236
we're in gather so people who want to

2049
01:51:50,258 --> 01:51:52,764
keep discussing the textbook could go

2050
01:51:52,802 --> 01:51:54,768
there into a different room. People who

2051
01:51:54,774 --> 01:51:57,152
want to do Tools can go into another

2052
01:51:57,286 --> 01:52:01,410
place. So we need to figure out

2053
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:05,216
how to do that through the

2054
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:06,816
people who want to be there, like these

2055
01:52:06,918 --> 01:52:08,224
people and the feedback that everybody

2056
01:52:08,262 --> 01:52:09,792
has in the ways they want to co create

2057
01:52:09,846 --> 01:52:11,796
it. Tim and then anyone else who has

2058
01:52:11,818 --> 01:52:13,908
like last thoughts? Hey. Yeah, I was

2059
01:52:13,914 --> 01:52:15,364
just going to say this is generally way

2060
01:52:15,402 --> 01:52:17,456
more interesting than the Tools meeting

2061
01:52:17,488 --> 01:52:18,470
generally is.

2062
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,652
Cross pollination shows great potential

2063
01:52:23,716 --> 01:52:26,664
already, I would say. Yeah, sounds good.

2064
01:52:26,702 --> 01:52:27,704
I just wanted to add to that

2065
01:52:27,742 --> 01:52:29,224
conversation, though, about someone even

2066
01:52:29,262 --> 01:52:31,530
mentioned Plato, Socrates and all that

2067
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,544
and that whole sort of recursive

2068
01:52:33,592 --> 01:52:36,830
involution of that

2069
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:40,012
raification thing you were talking about

2070
01:52:40,066 --> 01:52:43,084
and sort of the thought processes maybe

2071
01:52:43,122 --> 01:52:45,310
being almost like a recapitulation of

2072
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,284
the structure learning and the

2073
01:52:48,322 --> 01:52:50,176
Kreptasian factor graphs and all that

2074
01:52:50,198 --> 01:52:51,184
kind of thing you were talking about

2075
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:54,832
there. Plato had like a concept of

2076
01:52:54,886 --> 01:52:56,512
knowledge which he referred to as

2077
01:52:56,566 --> 01:52:59,956
recollection and this idea way,

2078
01:52:59,978 --> 01:53:02,644
way back where all learning and

2079
01:53:02,682 --> 01:53:04,724
knowledge is actually an act of

2080
01:53:04,842 --> 01:53:07,476
recollecting what we already know. And I

2081
01:53:07,498 --> 01:53:09,110
just wanted to point out there's kind of

2082
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:12,650
maybe just more of. An interesting.

2083
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,872
Illusion or connection, I guess between

2084
01:53:18,926 --> 01:53:22,356
those two where there seems like what's

2085
01:53:22,388 --> 01:53:23,704
old is new again. Or what have you

2086
01:53:23,742 --> 01:53:26,904
covered? Thanks,

2087
01:53:26,942 --> 01:53:30,680
Tim. Anyone else

2088
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,936
who hasn't spoken or who would like to

2089
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:33,690
add anything?
