1450	65680	00:01	It's week three of the textbook group first cohort. We're in week three discussing appendix A and B. There are also some ideas and questions that people have raised. We'll go to the questions and then start with the most upvoted.	We'll discuss appendix A and B in the textbook group first cohort	The textbook group first cohort
67970	567760	01:07	The first question says appendix A is described as the mathematical background. What other math concepts and formalisms are important for learning and applying active inference? What are some resources and approaches for learning math that help us learn what is useful for active inference.	What other math concepts are important for learning and applying active inference	Inactive Inference: The Mathematical Background
567910	1036440	09:27	The chapters describe it as an introduction or a refresher to the basic mathematical techniques. The linear algebra is the first section, a two that is discussing a lot of important things. The appendix is there to somehow lightly supplement that.	The linear algebra is important for the upcoming chapters	The Dot Product and inference in linear algebra
1039760	1906410	17:19	Brock: What kinds of examples do you think would be useful for learning the equations and concepts in Appendix A? Would it make sense to read them in without appendix or putting the appendix last or somewhere else? Hopefully we can start to understand some of this in Math Learning Group.	Brock: Hopefully we can start to understand some of this in Math Learning Group	Appendix A: Learning Linear Algebra
1906990	2248020	31:46	Did anyone read Appendix A or B visually? Did you just ask if anyone read it? I totally read it with a highlighter and made several notes in the margin in my physical book. Going through the appendix is kind of refreshing on what you used to know about math.	This is a really tricky section in POMDP. It was challenging for me reading it	Read the POMDP Book Review
2249430	2338750	37:29	Eric: I was also confused about the O notation because in equation B one, it seems that it's a trajectory over outcomes. But then there's also a bold o, which implies that it also seems to be a vector. It would be awesome for description or any notes.	Jacob: I was confused about the O notation in equation B one	Exploring the marginalizing of state with the O notation
2339170	2652530	38:59	Ali: If the materials in these two appendices were to be integrated in the linear narrative of the whole book, it would be much more useful than separating out as separate appendices. That linear reading of the appendix is extremely confusing or extremely imprecise.	Mike: Ali, did you find the appendix useful as you went through chapters	The appendix and its place in the book
2653670	2953390	44:13	So in next week, we're going next two weeks. The coming chapters are going to be very different. They're going to pick up in that high road, low road dialectic that we talked about last time. Let's just see what figures, what equations might happen. What does anyone want to add?	The coming chapters are going to be very different because one didn't have any formalisms	Bayesian Inference: The First 2 Weeks
2958180	3555272	49:18	The format of the book is also relatively austere, though in a concise tone. There is a distinction between propositional knowledge and how to knowledge. What is going to be accessible and the order. What does anybody think about the opening quotations?	Ali: I've noticed some sidebar boxes that could be skipped over	Non-Probability: A Short Introduction
3555326	3900172	59:15	Can you think without acting or is thinking in action? This active paper is relating computational phenomenology with mental action. I tend to think that there's like a bias towards action in active inference. Will that ever constitute positive evidence for saying thinking is action?	Matthew: Can you think without acting or is thinking in action	Can Thinking Be In Action?
3900226	4004970	1:05:00	The term particular allegedly accidentally or intentionally is a pun. It can mean specific, like a physics for the specific systems that we're modeling. Another interpretation is like it's for particulate entities. The separation of something from all possible separations. Yet verbalization is a process, especially dialogue.	Separation is the separation of something from all possible separations	Separation of particulate entities
4007630	4631130	1:06:47	Jacob: Is it fair to say that to the extent we've drawn our boundaries and do see a reduction of free energy in this system, it reinforces the idea that there's something to that boundary structure as an entity in the world? This touches on the question of reification of scientific models.	Jacob Brock: I'm curious about Markov blankets and how they draw boundaries	Markov Blankets and the Realism
4632060	4726690	1:17:12	Brock ethanoli. Can you hear me? Yeah. Gather does this sometimes, but I don't know if it's because we have 15 people. How would they form? Presumably there is some point in that process where the Markov blanket is extremely poorly defined relative to the system.	Daniel thinks Brock can't hear him, but I can hear him	No Markov Blankets
4726770	4876850	1:18:46	It was also in relation to Matthew's question also about the free energy minimization thing. Otherwise fitting high parameter models optimally would be simply reducing to fitting single dimensional models alone. So the one layer Markov blanket when thinking about the rise and fall of civilization is not the end all.	Matthew: Thanks for sharing your thoughts on free energy minimization	Markov Blanket and the future of classical models
4879130	5081960	1:21:19	There's been a decent amount of work on the sort of hierarchical or fractal composition of these models. With better annotation, we could have better answers. It's quite common to see nested models in the context of nesting of cognitive processes.	There's a decent amount of work on hierarchical or fractal composition of models	On the composability of active inference models
5083450	5429390	1:24:43	Daniel: I'm curious if there are examples of demonstrating that kind of composability of generative models. If people know any some areas to investigate. How does the observation and actions of one system map to the preferences of another? How does that come into being existence?	Daniel: I'm curious if there are examples of composability of generative models	Generative models of the world
5432930	5542050	1:30:32	Daniel: Some of the ideas that helped me a little bit to start even conceptualizing this. It could be like just grouping of relationships and interactions. Those are the things I was like, okay, so relationships, filters, kind of like connecting interactions between things.	Daniel: Some of the ideas that helped me start conceptualizing this filter	Relationships and filters in the science experiments
5542120	5733060	1:32:22	Like interacting entities. So you could have the edges representing some interaction, like when people are fitting a linear model. The more of a loose interaction you allow, the more challenge there is to fit that statistical model. However, within the model inference, a lot of these questions are very technical and downstream of importance.	Some variables have edges between them that could be designed to be there	Bayesian inference with variational Bayesian graphs
5738550	6230530	1:35:38	Ali: What will help people with the synchronous and Asynchronous make the most of the next few months? Do people appreciate having a longer discussion for this? Is there another subgroup, like a philosophy discussion, that people want to kind of really do this?	Ali: What will help people with synchronous and Asynchronous make most of meetings	Applied Active Inference Group Meeting
6237130	6312990	1:43:57	Most of this is new material for me and so I'm really enjoying the breadth of the conversation. How much do we sort of separate out the pieces and go deep dive in different places versus more of touching on multiple threads and their interactions?	Lyle: I'm enjoying the breadth of the conversation so far	The Dimensions of the Philosophy
6314390	6381794	1:45:14	The live streams is about papers, so there's 46 papers. Guest streams are not driven by a paper. These are like presentations, hearing from different perspectives. If anybody wants to help organize these, that's what we do in comms.	The live streams are not driven by a paper	Live Streams in the UC
6381922	6463470	1:46:21	The meetings are on Mondays at 13 and 23 UTC. The rate limiting step is not people's availability for a 1 hour meeting. It's however much time people want to contribute. Whatever practices and things will find something that works for people who want to be engaged.	About the timetable for the meetings, what specific times are they occurring at	The Organization Unit Meetings
6464580	6666930	1:47:44	Jessica. This was related to the question about applied projects. I was thinking that maybe one thing that we could do is on the project ideas to have a table where people can briefly share what they want to do. There's many ways to apply that are just in different codas.	Jessica. This was related to the question about applied projects. I was thinking that maybe one	Applications in Machine Learning
6670180	6831470	1:51:10	In the future we're in gather so people who want to keep discussing the textbook could go there into a different room. Cross pollination shows great potential already, I would say. Anyone else who hasn't spoken or who would like to add anything?	Tim: Any final thoughts on this interesting semi pattern breaking	Intro to Cross-Pollination
