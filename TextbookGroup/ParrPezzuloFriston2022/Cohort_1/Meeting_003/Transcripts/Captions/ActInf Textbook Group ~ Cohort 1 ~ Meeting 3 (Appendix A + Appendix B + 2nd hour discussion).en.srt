1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,159
okay

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,679
it is

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,000
may 19th 2022 and it's week three of the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
textbook group

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,280
first cohort

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,200
we're in week three

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,560
discussing appendix a and b

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,880
and

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
there are some notes in

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,359
the sections of the book in the chapters

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
there are also some ideas and questions

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
that people have raised

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,760
so we'll

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
go to the questions and then start with

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,680
the most upvoted so feel free to add

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,480
more upvotes

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,960
if you want to discuss it

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,840
like even in this

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,399
discussion and then hopefully

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
if people are available to take notes in

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,879
this section that will help add their

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,000
thoughts in

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,760
and also capture what the speakers are

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,800
saying

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
and then we'll look at the question and

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
then

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
try to come to different answers and

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
just add more information that people

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,080
can add

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,199
more structure to later

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,720
okay the first question says appendix a

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
is described as a mathematical

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
background

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,200
so

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
maybe question one

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
for the authors or for you what is the

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,560
process of determining what is figuring

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
ground for the formalisms

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,640
of active

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,119
what other math concepts and formalisms

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,119
are important for learning and applying

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,560
active inference

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
and then three what are some resources

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,159
and approaches

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,960
for

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
learning math that help us learn what

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,880
isn't what is useful for active

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,880
inference

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
anyone can raise their hand or we can

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,800
just start to add some annotations here

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,599
like

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,480
what should be included in the primary

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,120
regime of attention with a

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
reading of a book either linearly like

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,879
some books are

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,560
or in a maybe moving around the sections

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,470
so what should be in the chapters

58
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,840
[Music]

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,519
what should be in the appendix what is

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,920
not in the appendix

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
what did people expect would be in the

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,800
chapter in the appendix not covered

63
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,720
yeah jessica and then anyone else

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
um yeah i was wondering

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
about the multiplication of the matrices

66
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,599
that we covered yesterday um which

67
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,440
equations and

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,239
have

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,280
the multiplication of the matrices

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
like a couple of examples just so i can

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,720
like

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,599
play around with them

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
like in the actual like active inference

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
equations

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
does anyone um know one

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,959
this is referencing

77
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
the way that the appendix a is starting

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
with linear algebra

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,959
and then

80
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
introducing this operation of

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
um multiplying two matrices or

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
to get a product

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
if someone can find

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
like an equation from the tr that we've

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
already seen or some other equation

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
while i'm typing up that question that

87
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,519
would be helpful

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
could anyone

89
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
just describe what they

90
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
thought

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
the intention was of

92
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,440
starting with linear algebra and using

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
8.1 is the first equation of the

94
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,680
appendix or we'll return to just the

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
more

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,039
general questions

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
yeah um

98
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
i mean linear algebra is kind of the

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
most

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
discreet

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
um

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
i don't want to say fundamental but like

103
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,840
uh practical and comprehensive way of

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
kind of

105
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
working with a large space of data i

106
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,039
guess um together

107
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
and computing on it so

108
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
it's kind of the basis for

109
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
the discrete

110
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,319
parts

111
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
and maybe easier than the non-discrete

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
parts

113
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,759
good reason to start

114
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,198
i guess if the question was

115
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,680
where is a linear algebra used in the

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,400
active inference

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,719
math

118
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
when you go to

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
appendix b

120
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,280
then

121
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,680
the equations of active inference

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,639
and these are all expressed in terms of

123
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,440
large vector spaces of

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,400
variables so probability distributions

125
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
and so for example on page 245 you've

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,759
got this dot notation which is the

127
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
expectation

128
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
of a value

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
so that that

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,440
goes directly back to that first section

131
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
of appendix a is what does that mean in

132
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,520
terms of how do you take an expectation

133
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
of a large

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
vector of things how do you express that

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
compactly

136
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
thanks um could you

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,880
unpack uh we looked at the dot notation

138
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,319
a little bit

139
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
in uh yesterday

140
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,479
and

141
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,120
they were mentioning how well i think it

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
was actually one of the questions too

143
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
let's just see if someone asked this

144
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
okay

145
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
they say the dot operator

146
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
in a3

147
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
the dot operator is equivalent to

148
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,599
standard matrix multiplication

149
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,199
where the first matrix has been

150
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,560
transposed

151
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
so

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
what is the relationship with

153
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
expectation

154
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,919
when we're talking like what are where

155
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,479
how does expectation this is for anyone

156
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,400
how does expectation relate to

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,638
linear algebra

158
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,039
yeah expectation is the probability

159
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,400
of a value

160
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,679
the average probability of some value so

161
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
you're going to take all the possible

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
values

163
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,839
and you're going to multiply them by the

164
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,440
probability of that

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,719
value

166
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,559
and then divide by the sum of the you

167
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
know well probability normal is to one

168
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
so that will be the expectation so if

169
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
you have a whole array or a vector of

170
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
you know in your distribution

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,839
you can express that all in compact

172
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,399
notation by saying with this simple way

173
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
of saying we're going to take every one

174
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
of these terms and we're going to

175
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
multiply it by the probability of that

176
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
term

177
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
and

178
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
the probability sum to 1 so then that

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
will be your your average

180
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
overall

181
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,200
awesome thanks for that answer

182
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:15,520
um

183
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,630
[Music]

184
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
okay thanks for that awesome answer does

185
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
anyone have any other

186
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,560
thoughts on just this first question

187
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,200
and then we'll continue so

188
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
what

189
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,959
is figuring ground

190
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
we're learning active inference in the

191
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
chapters that's why the chapters are

192
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,279
there

193
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
the appendix is there to somehow

194
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
lightly supplement that

195
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
like they describe it as

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
an introduction or a refresher to the

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
basic basic mathematical techniques

198
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,959
and linear algebra

199
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,120
is the first section

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
a2

201
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
that is discussing a lot of important

202
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
things like derivatives and

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
probabilities

204
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,519
taylor series variational calculus and

205
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
stochastic dynamics are going to come in

206
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
in the coming chapters

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
but the linear algebra is is a important

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,920
for the upcoming chapters

209
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,680
okay

210
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,959
so

211
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,279
this question asked in a3

212
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
they say the dot operator is equivalent

213
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
to standard matrix multiplication where

214
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
the first matrix has been transposed

215
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,079
which is flipped like it's the operation

216
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,240
in google sheets or excel right click

217
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
paste transpose

218
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
they say that in the case of column

219
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,279
matrices

220
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,680
this is equivalent to the dot product

221
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
so the dot operator here is like a

222
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,360
generalization of the vector dot

223
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
operator the sum of the products of the

224
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
corresponding entries of the two

225
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
sequences of numbers

226
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,240
so the questions here were what

227
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
is interpretation implication or use of

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
the dot product of vectors

229
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
and then what is an interpretation

230
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
implication or use of a more generalized

231
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
dot product and it looks like there's a

232
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,519
awesome answer

233
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
what would be a situation

234
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,639
where

235
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,279
if anyone can think of one like

236
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,839
the dot product would be applied

237
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,200
like you know

238
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
we're just we're trying to do this in

239
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,800
this situation

240
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,839
this is the operation that we needed

241
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,600
we wanted to compute matrix a on

242
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,720
something

243
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
of something

244
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
we used b dot c

245
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
um

246
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
let's continue eric's

247
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
uh description

248
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,560
from probability like if you have

249
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,839
expectation probability

250
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
and you wanted to

251
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
kind of see the error or

252
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
uh

253
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
whatever the difference i guess uh

254
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,720
between observation and

255
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
and the expectation

256
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,600
then a dot product would give you

257
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,079
that answer

258
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,319
or

259
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,920
i think it's a probability density of it

260
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
what are some ways to compute

261
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
differences

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
like you can if there are scalars you

263
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
can subtract

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,519
like five minus three or something

265
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
then it was mentioned of cosine

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
similarity

267
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,079
does anyone think of or or imagine like

268
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
another way that you could compute the

269
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,600
difference between two different

270
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,320
like kinds of

271
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,279
features of different dimensions

272
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,120
like another example is divergence

273
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
because that's like measuring the

274
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
differences between these two

275
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,199
distributions and there's different

276
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,079
divergences the kl is one of them

277
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,160
what uh what other things are in this

278
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
space that might be just

279
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,199
tractable

280
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,160
possible distance measures

281
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,800
well

282
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,399
i mean these are these are the same

283
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,839
dimensionality

284
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
in all these cases but

285
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,199
another

286
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
very popular one is the sum square

287
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
difference

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
sum squared error

289
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
and then um

290
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
you can have absolute different value

291
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
difference

292
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
so these are called different um norms

293
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,760
i think that's what i work

294
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,880
yes

295
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,040
there's also the ginny index

296
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,839
the jacquard index

297
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,959
um

298
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
euclidean distances like samples of

299
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,440
sample distances

300
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,880
so

301
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,160
um

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,440
did anyone

303
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
talk about l0 l1 and l2 etc norms while

304
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,199
i'm adding some links

305
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
uh if i have the right

306
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
numbers here l to norm would be the

307
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,320
square root of the sum of squares l one

308
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,600
norm would be

309
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
the

310
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
um

311
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,320
average of the absolute absolute value

312
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
differences

313
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,279
and l zero i don't know what that is uh

314
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,639
well i don't think that's a difference

315
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,639
is it it's like a presence absence

316
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
okay

317
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
just

318
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
so it's like a

319
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,240
that kind of encoding is used in a lot

320
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,279
of different

321
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,839
algorithms

322
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
and then the l2 norm

323
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
is the sum of squares

324
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
so the l2 norm is what is used like in a

325
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,959
least squares regression

326
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
classical statistics

327
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
t-test anova

328
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,880
that's a lot driven by the l2

329
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,199
norm

330
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,399
and all of that is like

331
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,279
in the genre of what the a3 notation is

332
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,839
describing

333
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,399
and they're but depending on what the b

334
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,959
and the c are and what the a is etcetera

335
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,240
there's just the dimensions of

336
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,320
everything and other operations that are

337
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,600
happening before after it

338
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,000
later on they mentioned the quadratic

339
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
which is the l2 norm so that's where you

340
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,040
have

341
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
the you know the same term is multiplied

342
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,759
by itself or if you have cross terms

343
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,959
then you get the covariance

344
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
and that's going to be used

345
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,160
later with the laplace approximation and

346
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,360
other approximation techniques

347
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
any other comments on a3

348
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,319
or dot product

349
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
or just like this like kind of linear

350
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
algebra

351
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,839
topic

352
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
linear algebra the

353
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,120
basics the trace and the determinant

354
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,799
which are probably less important than

355
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,559
the dot product but still come into play

356
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
the derivatives

357
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
how things change with respect to each

358
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,600
other

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
possibly time possibly some other

360
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,840
surface

361
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,439
and then probabilities

362
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
so does anyone have any other comments

363
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,720
or thoughts on that whole section like

364
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,240
anything that they read or like had

365
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,000
uncertainty around up to equation a22

366
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
great that no one has uncertainty around

367
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
any of the equations up to a22

368
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,720
yeah i mean

369
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
obviously there is a lot to like learn

370
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,039
and to understand and we're not going to

371
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
it's just i don't know people who want

372
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,520
to think about that like what are we

373
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
learning in appendix a

374
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,799
why is appendix a there

375
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,559
that hopefully we can start to

376
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
understand some of this in math learning

377
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,600
group

378
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,799
with the people who want to be really

379
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
engaged with the math

380
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,919
questioning

381
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,679
and process

382
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,720
and then

383
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
and also connecting it to computer

384
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,559
science into the applications like has

385
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
been happening

386
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
and then hopefully everyone can can

387
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,679
benefit from this like finding the

388
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,760
resources and stuff

389
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,440
because the relationships between the

390
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
terms relationships amongst the terms

391
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,200
are

392
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,799
driven by formalisms

393
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
like the way that preferences and

394
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
expectations are framed in active

395
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
inference

396
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,440
is related to equations

397
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,799
not

398
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,320
only a conceptual linkage

399
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,918
okay

400
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,440
maybe here we can just write math

401
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
learning group

402
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
and copy this to the resources

403
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,240
okay

404
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,120
so

405
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,640
what kinds of examples

406
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,840
do you think would be useful for

407
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,520
learning the equations and concepts in

408
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
appendix a

409
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
if the equations felt too general

410
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,280
and not applying to anything in

411
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,640
particular

412
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,440
what

413
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
example or scenario

414
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,799
or like

415
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,400
would have made sense or

416
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,080
you felt would have made that clearer

417
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,039
like we're running a business and first

418
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,880
this person wants to do this

419
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,360
and then this person wants to do that or

420
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
what example or what would somebody have

421
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,280
expected to have found or wanted to have

422
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
found

423
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,158
that would have made it clear

424
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,400
examples or other exercises

425
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
or a format this is kind of like a math

426
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,159
lecture

427
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,159
it's kind of directional versus like

428
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,080
what other things could happen where you

429
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,440
would feel like you were understanding

430
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,120
and learning this and engaging with it

431
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
jess thanks brock

432
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
i was kind of reminded of a video that

433
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,159
carl

434
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
um a presentation

435
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
um

436
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
where he

437
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,120
like in real time demonstrates

438
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,879
uh and helps you

439
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,240
work through like a pattern of red like

440
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
it's like three dots sort of that are

441
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
moving around red green and this pattern

442
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,080
and so

443
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,200
um

444
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
understanding

445
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,400
like uh just a simple visual example um

446
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,880
of how active inference

447
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,159
would work

448
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:38,660
um

449
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,960
[Music]

450
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,159
that doesn't

451
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,480
you know um require the formalism to

452
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,039
just you know uh the surface level kind

453
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,720
of pattern recognized

454
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,600
that would be like ideal maybe of then

455
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,240
bringing in the math for this part and

456
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
that part and

457
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,720
some scaffolding you know um but

458
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,799
yeah i'm not i'm not sure the appendix

459
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,200
i'm not sure it was meant to be bread

460
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
and

461
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,720
i'm not sure there's a great way to read

462
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
one order or another there like

463
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,159
because you kind of need it but you kind

464
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,360
of

465
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
yeah

466
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,240
a lot too right so

467
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,520
yeah

468
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,919
great point and uh like

469
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,799
the organizing team for the textbook

470
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,840
group which

471
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
was open to everybody who wanted to join

472
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,120
the edu and the comms weekly meetings so

473
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,280
for future cohorts people could totally

474
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
be involved with planning it

475
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,559
communicating it

476
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,039
doing anything for future cohorts

477
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,240
as a co-organizer or other role

478
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,559
but we talked a lot about the reading

479
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,240
order

480
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
would it make sense to

481
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
read them

482
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,200
in

483
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,480
without

484
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
appendix or putting the appendix last

485
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,159
or somewhere else

486
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:08,960
um

487
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,919
one was short and hopefully the one week

488
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,159
of regime of attention on appendix a and

489
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,200
b is like

490
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,240
we're just

491
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
skimming it in a week

492
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
we're not

493
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
getting a phd in math

494
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
we're not generating these equations on

495
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
a blank piece of paper

496
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,360
we're just like seeing the forms

497
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,159
that will be used and then some of the

498
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,760
key areas

499
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
in the order that the authors thought

500
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,520
that those background topics were

501
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,880
important so like for appendix a

502
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
linear algebra which is what we talked

503
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,559
the most about because it's going to

504
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,240
come into play

505
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
most quickly

506
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,919
especially with these notions of like

507
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,000
expectation and differences

508
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,320
which is going to come into play

509
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,799
with everything that's going to happen

510
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,960
taylor series

511
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
variational calculus and stochastic

512
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,279
dynamics

513
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
we talked less about

514
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
they happened in a later order within

515
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
the appendix

516
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,200
but hopefully there will still be many

517
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,799
questions on them

518
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,200
because they're probably also areas with

519
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,760
a lot to learn and to clarify

520
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
and also appendix a is like not the

521
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,039
final

522
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,840
resource of it diffusing into us

523
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
like something that was really important

524
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
came up in the math learning group

525
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,559
is

526
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,440
there's not like a glossary of variables

527
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,919
or table of variables so that's

528
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,400
something we can work on with notation

529
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
is connecting the variables

530
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,240
to natural language ontology terms

531
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,840
and then also

532
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,200
things like this

533
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
what do we even look up

534
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,559
or a symbol

535
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,919
or what does it mean when there's a

536
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,000
double arrow there's a lot of things

537
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,799
that

538
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,000
like a lot of dots that could be

539
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
connected

540
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
if people ask them

541
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,279
and then we can probably get a response

542
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,320
like what was the double arrow in a3

543
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
what does it mean anything that they're

544
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,039
offset

545
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,200
or what is what are the parts of this

546
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
shape that are mattering

547
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,760
for the background of learning active

548
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
inference

549
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,039
anyone can ask like any question if it's

550
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,159
coming to mind as an uncertainty

551
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,320
then writing it down just anywhere is

552
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
really helpful

553
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,039
because then

554
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,000
on the first pass through learning or a

555
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
primary branch of learning we can just

556
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
go okay here's what a1 shows

557
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,279
and then have that in a way that reduces

558
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,600
uncertainty more rapidly than

559
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
how any of us would just give an ad hoc

560
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
explanation

561
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,679
yeah one thing that i i always find

562
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,240
useful in thinking about matrix you know

563
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
linear algebra matrices is to write out

564
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,159
pictures of the matrices in their

565
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
dimensions because often the notation

566
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
you've got these eyes and j's and k's

567
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,679
and stuff going around but you don't

568
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,520
know how that maps out into the actual

569
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
elements of the matrix so

570
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,159
those illustrations are always helpful

571
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,360
that are

572
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,279
you know could be added into this this

573
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,960
book they're in a few places but not

574
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
that much

575
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,559
there you go those things like that and

576
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
yeah yeah and also like connecting the

577
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,279
programming experience that people might

578
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,799
have even in no code tools like

579
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,720
excel google sheet like you have rows

580
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
and columns

581
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
ones have numbers and ones have letters

582
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
but they can be other things

583
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
and then

584
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,760
anyone who has used something like

585
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,679
python or r

586
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,159
or even just doing some statistical

587
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,480
calculations like if you put two lists

588
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
of numbers into the t-test

589
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,400
that would be vector versus vector

590
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,720
something and then you would address the

591
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,559
fifth element of the list

592
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,400
and then if it was in excel you would

593
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
need to address two numbers

594
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,240
to say where you were in the matrix and

595
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
then the tensor is just any number of

596
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
more than

597
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,039
three dimensions

598
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
which is sometimes like it's like oh but

599
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,400
how spatially are we going to see it but

600
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,159
then we're familiar with working with

601
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,240
spreadsheets and data sets

602
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
that are

603
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
larger than two by two or larger than

604
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
two dimensions

605
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,840
so

606
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
like you could and and that will come

607
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,520
into play a lot and the numbers can be

608
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,279
representing probabilities or be used

609
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
for probabilities

610
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
i also daniel share in the chat shared a

611
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,120
link to a python notebook that has

612
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
uh there's a link and it shows kind of

613
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,240
the operations on matrices and kind of

614
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
you know you can see both the

615
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,600
the mathematical yeah there you go and

616
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,440
so you can see the actual matrix and you

617
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,240
can actually run code too there so that

618
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,799
particular so awesome

619
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,039
so i pasted the link in here and then

620
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,000
we'll just

621
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,399
we'll we can fill out the

622
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,039
rest of the row

623
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,279
but then

624
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
someone could be looking for a guide on

625
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,279
matrix

626
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,080
or programming and matrix or something

627
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
before this state

628
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
so then each person if they find it and

629
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
add it here will have a lot

630
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,279
to share and learn

631
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
okay does anybody want to like if they

632
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
were the one who asked it this question

633
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,440
i think it's probably referring to long

634
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
equations that that probably none of us

635
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,039
are ready to give answers to at this

636
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,279
point

637
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
unless somebody wants to

638
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,159
contextualize this question

639
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,600
okay i'm hoping a read of chapter four

640
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
will elucidate when the time comes just

641
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,559
exploring the formal foundations here

642
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
okay

643
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,840
okay

644
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,760
does anyone have a favorite or

645
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,399
recommended textbook that it contains

646
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,240
the kl divergence

647
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,720
and dirichlet distribution in the index

648
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
this is for the math learning group okay

649
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,440
maybe we could tag some questions too

650
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,120
and so then we can know which ones that

651
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,799
they can look at

652
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,320
um wikipedia is good

653
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,159
the kl divergence is approachable the

654
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,720
dirichlet is tougher

655
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
the links take you to definitions that

656
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,918
enable you to put the pieces together

657
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,720
okay

658
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,440
any comments on kl

659
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,520
and dear schley

660
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
from someone who is familiar otherwise

661
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
like it sounds very technical and we

662
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,640
don't need to go into it right now

663
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,279
what is up with dividing by sigma

664
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,600
in a 31.

665
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,600
also

666
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
detail

667
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,559
but we'll just see if there's any

668
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,919
questions that are not going to be

669
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,600
specific details because math is very

670
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
hard to

671
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,440
it like

672
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,000
understands sometimes on the fly

673
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
and there's definitely a space for the

674
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
interactive discussions around math

675
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,679
that are unrecorded

676
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,320
which are important

677
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,520
however this is a little bit of a

678
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,120
different format

679
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,240
so

680
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,679
which is how i'm hopefully interpreting

681
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,080
people's

682
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,279
activity

683
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,480
rather than their disengagements because

684
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
they are here and hopefully having

685
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,240
scanned these

686
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
chapters

687
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,000
anyone can raise their hand at any time

688
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,960
or

689
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,320
add questions or upload things

690
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,159
mean field

691
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,760

694
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,559
statistical question

695
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,000
appendix b just to see if there is any

696
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,039
also seem like all details

697
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,960
so we have 23 minutes what does anybody

698
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,399
want to

699
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,840
ask

700
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,039
now

701
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,200
or is there some

702
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,840
question

703
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,000
here like the most upvoted one or some

704
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
other one that's far less

705
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,000
challenging

706
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
that they would like to address for the

707
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,840
next 20 minutes

708
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,519
did anyone read appendix a or b visually

709
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,279
did you just ask if anyone read it

710
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,799
yes what would anyone like to share

711
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,600
about reading it

712
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,240
i totally read it um with

713
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
a highlighter and

714
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,919
made several notes in the margin in my

715
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,760
physical book

716
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,159
um it was challenging a lot of the

717
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,240
notation i feel like

718
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,159
um

719
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,200
is

720
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
like crazy

721
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,360
like like um i mean

722
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,000
even just in appendix b like the very is

723
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,320
was it the very first thing like are

724
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,000
they using o

725
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,480
for observations are they using o for

726
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,679
outcomes like i was totally unclear on

727
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,320
that um completely

728
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,360
so like state inference markov decision

729
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,600
processes like

730
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,960
um the states that influence outcomes oh

731
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,760
right

732
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,120
like literally that's what it says on

733
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,679
the top of page 244.

734
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,679
so it says that the variable o is an

735
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,880
outcome

736
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,799
is an outcome and observation are those

737
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,640
the same thing are they interchangeable

738
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,440
like

739
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,840
i've always thought oh was observations

740
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,079
um that i put that question in there

741
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,199
in a picture

742
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,760
it's already there um

743
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,079
and and then the the the question right

744
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,320
before it like this is a really a really

745
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
tricky section right so

746
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
there's two the two questions that are

747
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,639
in appendix b that are together it says

748
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,079
the likelihood of observations given a

749
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,918
policy is not straightforward to compute

750
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,839
this is because pomdp problem is

751
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,918
structured so that policies pi

752
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,839
influence trajectories indicated by

753
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,320
tilda of states s that influence

754
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,879
outcomes o without a direct influence of

755
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,800
policies on outcomes

756
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,119
the problem then involves a sum over

757
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,918
trajectories of states to marginalize

758
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,239
these out and find a marginal likelihood

759
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,159
of observations given policies like what

760
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
does that these even refer to if you

761
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,159
look in the questions in appendix b like

762
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,079
they're there in the questions already

763
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,079
listed so i mean

764
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,720
i felt like it was very obscure and not

765
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,040
super clear and also like the notation

766
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
gets crazy

767
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,560
um and i'm like really a stickler for

768
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
like defining every single variable and

769
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,160
symbol in an equation to understand the

770
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
math so that i can actually read it in

771
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,480
english so i was a little bit lost

772
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
totally agree

773
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
thanks for sharing it

774
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
eric just with respect to that

775
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
particular question

776
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
um

777
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
i think that these refers to the

778
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,520
trajectories of states and you can see

779
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,880
that because the sum is over the tilde s

780
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,200
so the tilde s is the trajectories of

781
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
states

782
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,599
so you sum over all the trajectories of

783
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,839
states to try to figure out well what

784
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,440
are we going to get

785
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
if we apply a given policy

786
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,800
that's my intuition about that

787
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,920
and i suspect also that observations are

788
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,000
outcomes they're sensory outcomes

789
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,160
they're the outcome of a generative

790
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
model

791
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
or a generative process but they're the

792
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,079
outcome

793
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,960
that is observed

794
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,440
but

795
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,280
how many how many dots we need to

796
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
actually unpack and connect for

797
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,880
unsighted

798
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,599
grammatically vague sentences

799
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,520
right like so thank you my uncertainty

800
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,440
has been reduced substantially just by

801
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,720
like

802
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
figuring that out but like i felt like

803
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,079
that the whole time i was reading the

804
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,480
appendix is like what is even going on

805
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,720
here

806
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,480
yeah so

807
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
in you know

808
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,680
yes sir the way i view it is like

809
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,960
exercising

810
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,640
you're not going to run a marathon the

811
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,359
first time you you set out but you know

812
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,320
the more you you stretch and warm up

813
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
and that's kind of i think that's how i

814
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,599
kind of view this uh going through the

815
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,920
appendix is kind of refreshing on what

816
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
you used to know about math or at least

817
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,320
for me

818
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
and so that's like stretching and doing

819
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,400
a little bit of exercise the last week

820
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,640
and then every time you go through it

821
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,160
every time you see the notation you've

822
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,000
slept on it some more

823
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,760
it becomes more more familiar and so you

824
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,520
can start to put together bigger bigger

825
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,800
chunks some vaguely you can map to the

826
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
notation

827
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
and the math other ones it's still going

828
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
to be dangling but that's okay because

829
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,880
there's fewer dangling things that

830
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
you're groping with at any

831
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
given moment so i think it's great to go

832
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,240
through these dependencies and see it

833
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,119
all through one pass and all right so i

834
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,200
didn't run a marathon but that's okay i

835
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,119
ran two miles that's pretty good for

836
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
first start

837
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
thanks eric

838
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,960
another like metaphor is just like oh

839
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,839
yes please

840
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,480
jakub

841
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
yeah i was just i was just gonna uh

842
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,800
comment on what uh blue said

843
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,760
uh with the kind of

844
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,119
some

845
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,040
um confusion about the notation because

846
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,839
uh

847
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,920
i asked the question about the

848
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
the marginalizing of states but then i

849
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,760
was also confused about the o notation

850
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,960
because

851
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,839
um

852
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,680
in the in equation b b.1 it kind of

853
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,720
it it seems that it's a trajectory over

854
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,520
outcomes but then there's also an o

855
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,359
without a tilde on it

856
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,280
so does that mean that it's an outcome

857
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,119
at a particular point in time but then

858
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,400
there's also

859
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
a bold o

860
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,880
which

861
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
implies that it's kind of a vector but

862
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,880
if it's a trajectory of outcomes that's

863
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,359
also that also seems to be a vec like a

864
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,720
trajectory

865
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,160
for me implies some kind of vector form

866
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,320
uh because it's a sequence of outcomes

867
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,960
given a policy but then

868
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,480
what does that

869
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
bold o uh

870
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,200
mean if not trajectories over outcomes

871
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,160
so

872
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
just to kind of

873
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,839
add to the uh confusion i

874
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,160
guess thanks jacob i'm glad like we're

875
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,720
groking we're on the same page you and i

876
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
for sure

877
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
um

878
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,280
it would be awesome for description or

879
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,200
any notes

880
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
what is the reading or a reading in

881
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,800
language

882
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
the this of this conditioned on that

883
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,040
is this over that

884
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,880
of these two things the first thing is

885
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
this the second one is that

886
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,160
an example of that is in this situation

887
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,680
here's the script

888
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,440
here's the graphical abstract here's the

889
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
paper

890
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,359
here's the person you could ask

891
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,640
which one of these do you think is going

892
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,839
to be interesting

893
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,280
okay so mike asked and i'll copy this in

894
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,800
for those who have read the entire book

895
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
did you find the appendices useful as

896
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,079
you went along through the chapters

897
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,359
uh ali

898
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,680
uh yeah i also think that uh if these

899
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,560
the materials in these two appendices

900
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,720
were to be integrated in uh

901
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
in the linear

902
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,160
narrative of the whole book

903
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,480
it would be much more useful than

904
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,280
separating out as

905
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,880
i mean separate appendices because

906
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,920
as as we see i i mean that's my own

907
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,280
experience well reading the chapters

908
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,400
independently and in isolation of the

909
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,200
narrative it doesn't give me a sense of

910
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,880
their uh concrete applications and

911
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
i don't know how to use them and how to

912
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,119
use these uh for

913
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,200
all of these equations and

914
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,399
everything becomes much more fuzzy

915
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
i hope this is not controversial that

916
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,640
linear reading of the appendix as

917
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
something that you look through

918
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,280
is extremely confusing or extremely

919
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,760
imprecise because there's many symbols

920
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
introduced

921
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,520
that might have been introduced earlier

922
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
like o is probably

923
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
discussed earlier

924
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,280
but then it's

925
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,359
briefly just sort of mentioned and then

926
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,520
there's a lot of symbology that's not

927
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,160
mentioned what it is

928
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,359
so it's hard to read the appendix

929
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,319
without prior knowledge

930
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,440
yet ostensibly appendix a

931
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,240
is the introduction refresher

932
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,200
so is this the introduction

933
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,839
offering

934
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,079
they hope so they expect and prefer

935
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,400
perhaps the appendix to go some way

936
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,160
towards remedying

937
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,680
it

938
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,839
being the maths required to understand

939
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
this not complicated

940
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,319
basis

941
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,440
the multidisciplinary basis means it is

942
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,119
often difficult to find resources that

943
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,480
bring together the necessary

944
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,200
prerequisites

945
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,839
they're going some way

946
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,560
so this is like one kind of plank out

947
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
there from their point of view from the

948
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,200
chapters

949
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,599
this is stuff like i also kind of agree

950
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,119
like on what what ordering these are

951
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,280
really interesting questions

952
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,400
so then what is the next

953
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,520
connector

954
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,400
that picks up here with this artifact

955
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,160
because um like someone mentioned how um

956
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,880
you

957
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,240
more it's mentioned you could basically

958
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,760
do a whole course on deep learning to

959
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,319
apply most of the matrix operations

960
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,400
and whole courses on like the math of

961
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,160
them

962
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,760
so they can't go into all this detail

963
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
they can't spend one hour

964
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
or like multiple coda pages on just what

965
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
this means

966
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
so there has to be some kind of

967
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,000
compromise but then there's not going to

968
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,240
be one specific perfect compromise

969
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,119
with especially with like length and

970
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,079
audience considered

971
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,200
so i think like um i mean i undertook

972
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,760
like a very detailed linear reading of

973
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,839
of the book because that's just kind of

974
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,560
how i am of the appendixes at least but

975
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,359
i think um for many people that like

976
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,599
i mean i've been there before like where

977
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,960
you're staring at math equations like

978
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,440
this is gibberish but like

979
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,680
so just to read the text you know and

980
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,040
like to read it and go through it it's

981
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,839
helpful to know that it's there so if

982
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,480
nothing else at least like you can be

983
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,319
reading the book and then be like oh i

984
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,680
remember kind of reading about you know

985
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,040
taylor series expansion in the appendix

986
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,680
and so then you can just go back and

987
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,760
just having access to it or the the

988
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,720
refresh recall access um even though it

989
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,119
is confusing i agree to try to a linear

990
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,319
read of the appendix it's um

991
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,119
i think

992
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,680
skimming over it or deeply reading it

993
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,359
and then being able to refer back to it

994
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,280
is useful

995
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,200
thanks blue

996
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,480
um so

997
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,280
in

998
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,040
next week

999
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,920
we're going next two weeks so the pace

1000
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
of one section per week

1001
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,880
might be like whatever it was for you

1002
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,079
however much time you put in et cetera

1003
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,520
the coming chapters are going to be very

1004
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,720
different

1005
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,880
because one didn't have any formalisms

1006
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,400
or figures really

1007
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,720
just the kind of overview figures

1008
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,119
but we're gonna have two weeks for two

1009
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,319
so

1010
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,560
no need to rush it read a couple pages

1011
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
and then just go back to the beginning

1012
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and just restart the same pages like

1013
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,079
that's like the multiple coats of paint

1014
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,280
in a mural

1015
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,760
like the low road to active inference

1016
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,359
that's where they're gonna pick up in

1017
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,440
that high road low road

1018
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,400
um

1019
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,599
dialectic that we talked about last time

1020
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,280
let's just see like what figures what

1021
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,040
equations might happen okay a lot of

1022
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,640
terms

1023
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,760
that

1024
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,440
um hopefully are in

1025
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,920
the ontology already like you can use

1026
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,040
the at

1027
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,800
symbol

1028
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,079
hopefully to call most of them

1029
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,000
but if something's not there we can add

1030
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,359
it to like supplemental or entailed

1031
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,319
okay

1032
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,000
so what figures

1033
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,079
and eq figures and equations what we

1034
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,599
might see

1035
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,960
here's a box

1036
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,359
2.1

1037
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,319
about probability

1038
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
here's an equation

1039
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,119
that's

1040
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,880
the bayesian

1041
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,480
kernel

1042
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,240
and it's going to be

1043
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,640
talking about this example of a frog and

1044
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,000
an apple

1045
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,640
and jumping or not jumping

1046
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,280
and that example is gonna play

1047
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,440
our current role but then some

1048
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,359
likelihoods are shown

1049
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,760
in a specific example of like frogs and

1050
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,119
jumping or not and apples

1051
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,240
there's a work through example of

1052
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,839
exact bayesian inference

1053
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,400
here's a table on statistical

1054
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
distributions

1055
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
it would be really interesting like to

1056
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,359
hear what support and surprise mean

1057
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,599
and why what are these are these all the

1058
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,680
distributions are there other ones or

1059
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
like why these ones or why are they

1060
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,480
useful

1061
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,240
where have they been used what does it

1062
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,720
even mean

1063
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,800
here's where the kl divergence

1064
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,560
is introduced

1065
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,520
and then

1066
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,160
some more analysis from a surprise

1067
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,400
perspective bayesian surprise

1068
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,280
with the kl divergence

1069
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,640
there's the box on expectations which is

1070
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,079
also what we talked about a little bit

1071
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,920
today and i was like really interesting

1072
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,839
to connect it to the matrices

1073
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,920
a figure

1074
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,960
of the

1075
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,640
generative process in the generative

1076
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
model

1077
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,079
is the caption

1078
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,480
a figure

1079
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,400
both perception and action minimize

1080
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
discrepancy between model and world

1081
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,960
variational free energy

1082
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,920
variational free energy as an upper

1083
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,200
bound on negative log evidence

1084
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,680
a figure but with equations in it

1085
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,960
very common format

1086
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,960
bigger

1087
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,880
complementary roles of perception and

1088
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,400
action in the minimization of

1089
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,040
variational free energy

1090
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,920
big active theme and like something a

1091
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,319
kind of a common fristenism

1092
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,960
like perception action being in the same

1093
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,839
game

1094
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,559
or being in the same service of the same

1095
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,040
objective function

1096
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,558
planning

1097
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,440
but no specific equations but probably

1098
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,000
citations

1099
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,359
just introducing expected free energy

1100
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,960
which jacob and and others can probably

1101
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,000
go into a lot more detail on

1102
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,800
expected free energy

1103
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,240
about a future where the outcomes

1104
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,959
haven't happened

1105
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,359
expected free energy figure with

1106
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,680
equations

1107
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,440
the end of the low road

1108
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,839
introducing the two

1109
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,400
key terms variational free energy

1110
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,520
expected free energy

1111
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
summary

1112
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,440
what does anybody like want to like add

1113
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,359
or what was something cool or whether

1114
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,319
they read it already or not

1115
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,640
what does anyone i'll eat yes please

1116
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,920
uh well i've noticed the dispersion of

1117
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,640
some

1118
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,319
sidebar boxes like box 2.1 or

1119
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,040
in this chapter

1120
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,480
i don't know the distinction between

1121
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,119
the purpose of these boxes and

1122
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,079
i mean

1123
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,720
what's the function of these boxes uh as

1124
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,079
compared to

1125
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,119
what we see in the appendices

1126
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,839
because presumably

1127
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
these boxes cover the concepts that

1128
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,240
could be skipped over if one is familiar

1129
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,960
with

1130
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,160
these mathematical concepts so

1131
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,760
do you have any idea

1132
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,319
about the reason

1133
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,359
behind this decision i mean

1134
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,240
uh

1135
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,319
covering some basic concepts basic

1136
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,559
mathematical concepts in these

1137
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,520
sidebar boxes and some others in the

1138
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,520
appendices

1139
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,280
that's a great question

1140
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,000
a box could reflect like

1141
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,640
okay expectations got it or like okay

1142
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,480
some product rule all right

1143
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
but it's kind of like you might want to

1144
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,440
read that or is this introductory

1145
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,640
highlighting it

1146
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,079
this is the 101 on probability

1147
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,839
or is it saying this is a total

1148
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,280
skippable unit if you want to learn

1149
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,520
about how the lizard does it

1150
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
here's where you look

1151
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,760
it can it can sometimes mean both and

1152
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,480
like

1153
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,280
the the format of the book is also

1154
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,839
relatively

1155
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,359
austere though in a concise tone

1156
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,400
um

1157
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,839
like

1158
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,000
it's in black and white

1159
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,359
which especially in some later sections

1160
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,440
makes some visualizations

1161
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,720
where it's like

1162
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
it's hard to understand like where like

1163
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,880
what curves are doing what

1164
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,720
it's a black and white image so what is

1165
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,640
there to see with the color i mean or

1166
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,920
but

1167
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,240
it also might predispose towards more

1168
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,760
simple or

1169
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,520
visually accessible

1170
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,359
material

1171
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,880
so what is going to be accessible

1172
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,400
and the order so those are all really

1173
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,559
important questions

1174
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,319
so we can just take notes on it you know

1175
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,839
in the weeks that we're going to

1176
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,839
continue to do this because we only have

1177
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,680
limited live time

1178
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,040
how about in the last like three minutes

1179
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,200
what does anybody think about the

1180
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,160
opening

1181
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,440
quotations

1182
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,720
or specifically this quotation

1183
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,480
my thinking is first and last and always

1184
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,359
for the sake of my doing william james

1185
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,839
you know i thought the guy was a

1186
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,079
philosopher so i guess you just abused

1187
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,720
me of that one

1188
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,480
these would be really

1189
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,119
nice areas to look into

1190
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,079
for people who like the history part

1191
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,440
um blue

1192
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,760
and i and others are working on some

1193
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,160
different kinds of ways to reference

1194
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,480
papers and

1195
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,040
just up cool paper

1196
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,880
sensation perception

1197
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,440
we have those terms we could just link

1198
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,599
the paper somewhere

1199
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,880
so if anyone's like interested in that

1200
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,960
kind of architectures

1201
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,200
or

1202
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,880
that kind of philosophy question

1203
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,079
[Music]

1204
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,240
those are

1205
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,800
the literature right now is small enough

1206
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,200
to know what has and hasn't been done in

1207
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,880
a lot of areas

1208
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,119
that are philosophical and applied and

1209
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,119
technical

1210
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,520
just from like a first principles what

1211
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,119
does this seem to mean

1212
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,319
uh that

1213
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,160
shared that other group that that we're

1214
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,280
kind of

1215
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,640
both a part of daniel um

1216
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,520
the liminal

1217
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,440
dowel thing that's not really a dow i

1218
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,119
don't know what it is but there's this

1219
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,400
debate

1220
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,559
for some reason that's going on there

1221
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,079
about

1222
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,119
you know different ways of knowing and

1223
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,520
being and doing and a bunch of stuff uh

1224
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,400
that is kind of

1225
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,559
a mix of philosophy and linguistic

1226
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,839
fallacies but um

1227
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,119
like if

1228
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,640
if thinking

1229
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,559
is actually a physical process which i

1230
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,400
think you know

1231
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,079
i don't think anyone here is going to

1232
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,680
argue against

1233
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,079
then it is something necessarily that is

1234
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,400
being done

1235
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,160
and

1236
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,079
so however i guess small you want to

1237
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,480
draw that markov blanket up and then

1238
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,880
however large whether that's your

1239
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,280
physical body actions or

1240
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,119
some extended thinking

1241
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,640
it's

1242
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,200
literally

1243
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,040
what you're doing uh

1244
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,960
they're

1245
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,559
it's not just for the sake of your

1246
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,480
actions but it's

1247
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,559
they are your actions

1248
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,200
like they're just others another set of

1249
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,680
your actions

1250
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,440
all right let me i'll offer a different

1251
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,960
take on it

1252
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,359
yeah awesome william william james was a

1253
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,200
great visionary

1254
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,359
and he foresaw

1255
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,680
marx mark zuckerberg's meta metaverse

1256
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,680
100 and

1257
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,440
20 years ago or whatever and he said no

1258
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,079
i don't want to live just inside my mind

1259
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,680
inside the metaverse

1260
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,839
i want to be out in the world interact

1261
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,920
with real people and real things so he

1262
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,960
was

1263
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,760
a

1264
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,920
meta or facebook skeptic

1265
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,720
way before his time

1266
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,160
okay thank you ali

1267
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,559
yeah as brock mentioned uh i think it

1268
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,240
relates to an epistemology

1269
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,839
epistemological

1270
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,760
um

1271
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,680
i mean distinction between uh

1272
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,400
propositional knowledge and uh how to

1273
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,280
knowledge and i think uh this statement

1274
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,720
by uh

1275
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,839
this statement here uh tries to blur

1276
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,480
this distinction blurs the line between

1277
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,839
uh

1278
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,760
propositional knowledge and know-how

1279
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
knowledge because in especially in

1280
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,200
analytical

1281
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,000
uh school of philosophy uh

1282
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,559
there's always been

1283
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,960
a very um

1284
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,839
uh

1285
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,079
let's say um

1286
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,640
not a heated debate but uh

1287
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,599
there's a long-standing uh debate uh

1288
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,200
about uh

1289
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,160
about the distinction between these uh

1290
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,720
two kinds of knowledge and whether uh

1291
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,079
they're in fact uh they can be uh

1292
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,079
distinguished from each other or not

1293
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,760
thank you could you just unpack what are

1294
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,599
the two kinds of knowledge again and

1295
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,280
what are just

1296
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,520
they referring to

1297
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,480
sure

1298
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,359
well

1299
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,680
about propositional knowledge

1300
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,520
well an example of propositional

1301
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,319
knowledge is uh to know

1302
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,960
uh the exact um

1303
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,400
mechanisms of walking uh i mean

1304
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,920
which muscles contract and uh which

1305
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,480
i mean in what

1306
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,400
angles uh the the uh

1307
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,839
i mean the whole thing about the

1308
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,160
uh biomechanics of walking the whole

1309
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,839
knowledge about the biomechanics of

1310
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,640
knowledge uh can constitute

1311
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,880
this kind of propositional knowledge

1312
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,680
and

1313
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,079
it's totally different from knowing how

1314
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,680
to walk

1315
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,040
i mean

1316
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,680
a three or four year old year old child

1317
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,359
has a know-how knowledge of walking but

1318
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,920
not necessarily

1319
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,000
where he or she doesn't know

1320
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,760
anything about the biomechanics of

1321
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,880
walking so the biomechanics of walking

1322
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,760
is the propositional knowledge

1323
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,799
actually knowing how to walk constitutes

1324
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,040
the know-how of

1325
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,040
walking

1326
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,799
so when people say things like

1327
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,119
active inference is integrating

1328
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,400
perception cognition and action

1329
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
maybe it is rethinking

1330
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,839
some of these long-held mental

1331
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,319
frameworks for distinguishing or

1332
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,160
operating differently on action and

1333
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,640
perception

1334
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,160
like one

1335
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,799
fascinating recent example from me was

1336
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,400
and working with eric

1337
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,839
was

1338
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,160
in the area of ant pheromone modeling

1339
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,839
without going into too many details

1340
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,079
people often modeled preference as a

1341
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,720
function of the absolute amount

1342
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,799
of pheromone on trails

1343
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,559
because that's what the exponential like

1344
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:35,839
decay is on that's what can be

1345
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,839
manipulated

1346
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,280
rather than

1347
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,839
the perceived intensity

1348
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,359
which might have a different scaling

1349
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,200
relationship so it's like a dim room you

1350
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,960
can detect a small change bright room

1351
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,359
you can't detect a small change

1352
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,599
so that kind of psychophysics

1353
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,760
of perception

1354
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,640
gets ignored

1355
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,640
implicitly

1356
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,599
because of calls for measurability

1357
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,760
because the cognitive can't be measured

1358
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,520
directly

1359
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,920
even if you potentially had a

1360
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,440
electrical measurement or something like

1361
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,240
that happening

1362
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,440
then these are awesome questions can you

1363
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,119
think without acting or is thinking in

1364
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,839
action

1365
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,920
this

1366
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,160
active paper

1367
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,680
which was on a live stream so we can

1368
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,480
provide the link to

1369
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,359
it models like perception and action in

1370
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,960
the sort of like

1371
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,400
kernel level

1372
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,280
just the autonomous sensing sentient bot

1373
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,720
level

1374
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,280
and then attention and metacognition are

1375
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,040
both

1376
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,599
related as actions

1377
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
to the lower level

1378
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,760
which is like why the paper

1379
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,720
is

1380
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,839
relating computational

1381
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:02,880
phenomenology with mental action

1382
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,359
again just to have like a look at the

1383
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,520
kinds of models that

1384
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,119
can happen

1385
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,079
and then

1386
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,799
now does making any model fitting any

1387
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,799
data well enough and saying well we

1388
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,799
modeled it as action

1389
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,440
so is thinking an action

1390
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,200
will that model that says yeah it's

1391
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
consistent with that will that ever

1392
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,040
constitute positive evidence for saying

1393
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,799
thinking is action

1394
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,280
or why even

1395
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,440
say that or what does it mean to say it

1396
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:35,780
and then here's a funny meme

1397
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,400
[Music]

1398
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
here's the generative model

1399
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,319
and the generative um the partially

1400
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,119
observable markov decision process

1401
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,079
here's carl fristen

1402
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,280
jessica and then anyone else

1403
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,480
ah yes um

1404
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,640
i guess it's like a beginning

1405
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,760
understanding of this it's like

1406
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,720
i tend to think that um

1407
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,960
there's like a bias towards action in

1408
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,359
active inference i think like the first

1409
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,119
chapter saying like

1410
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,520
you know even if you wanna like stand so

1411
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,280
like perceive you have to do some kind

1412
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,319
of action in order to um gain the

1413
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,839
information

1414
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,119
and and this like you know quote it's

1415
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,799
basically saying like okay

1416
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:27,920
even though

1417
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,520
the whole field is trying to understand

1418
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,040
cognition

1419
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,480
it's like

1420
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,960
what we decide to do and the thinking

1421
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,880
that we go through in order to determine

1422
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,599
our policy is to determine our actions

1423
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,319
and then it sort of like feed into um

1424
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,480
the thinking itself so maybe that's why

1425
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,720
there's like the bias to action

1426
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,319
and

1427
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,319
because like our actions is what it's

1428
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,960
going to be allowing the thinking

1429
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,160
but

1430
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,000
um

1431
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,400
yeah like when we update our models or

1432
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,839
like you know trying to come up with

1433
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,119
like the policies that we're going to be

1434
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,720
doing like we have to be processing

1435
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,599
things

1436
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,799
so you know the thinking is in like

1437
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,000
as a service to action and

1438
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,280
that's sort of like what i was thinking

1439
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,480
i don't know it's a little bit like you

1440
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,799
know with the chicken and the egg but

1441
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,079
and

1442
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,680
you know i kind of tend to think of it

1443
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,839
it's like yes like we have to act in

1444
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,760
order to understand

1445
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,000
but and like the understanding which

1446
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
will be coming from the thinking is what

1447
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,720
determines our next action

1448
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,599
and

1449
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,799
yeah that's kind of what i think

1450
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,759
matthew thanks jessica

1451
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,119
yeah i mean it kind of seems to me like

1452
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,640
we're stuck in a little bit of a

1453
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,039
linguistic godelian loop of some sort

1454
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,039
because you know thinking

1455
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,000
is you know essentially a verb and verbs

1456
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,440
tend to imply

1457
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,359
in like linguistic immersion term

1458
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,400
actions

1459
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,799
and so we have to then pop outside of

1460
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,880
that and try to consider with our

1461
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,559
internal medical processes

1462
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,200
how to disentangle these concepts but i

1463
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,119
see no reason to think

1464
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,079
that

1465
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,799
to think ironically that

1466
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,520
internal mental states aren't also

1467
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,480
conscious parameterizations of processes

1468
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,480
in the brain and our ability to grasp

1469
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,720
control of that to some extent and so it

1470
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,039
seems very strange to me to try to

1471
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,839
separate those linguistically

1472
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,119
from our current vantage point even

1473
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,200
though i understand why historically

1474
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,799
working only with language it might have

1475
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,079
made sense

1476
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:32,799
so

1477
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,799
those kind of quotes like james is

1478
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,400
strike me as somewhat

1479
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,440
antiquated or just you know operating on

1480
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,440
dichotomies that don't seem to make

1481
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,680
sense given that we've unpacked these

1482
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,960
processes to the degree we have

1483
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,640
thank you matthew very

1484
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,880
deep points

1485
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,799
like you mentioned thinking as a verb

1486
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,119
implies action

1487
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,119
and then just to kind of

1488
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,720
complete that

1489
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,280
thought is like the word

1490
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,079
for the noun form of this one

1491
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,039
so then what does that imply

1492
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,799
and then also like

1493
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,119
jessica mentioned

1494
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,559
to some extent that like we can only

1495
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,839
express processes through their

1496
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,200
discretization of you know via symbols

1497
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,319
right

1498
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:29,359
um

1499
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,280
the idea that like there's this process

1500
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,799
uh there's a flow there's something that

1501
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,920
can't necessarily be separated um

1502
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,319
obviously from the rest of the flows

1503
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:41,359
around it but to reference it uh to

1504
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,200
point to it to describe it communicate

1505
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,640
it to another agent

1506
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,319
we have to uh nounize it

1507
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,760
kind of like

1508
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,000
which is the opposite of verbalizing so

1509
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,079
to speak

1510
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,359
wow thank you matthew

1511
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,598
um

1512
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,880
again these are yes eric

1513
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,760
sorry i didn't have anything i didn't do

1514
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,720
okay the hand was yeah so

1515
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,520
um

1516
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,160
carl firsten had a influential

1517
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,240
2019

1518
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,200
uh

1519
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,720
paper

1520
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,079
long paper

1521
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:24,880
the

1522
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,640
free energy principle for a particular

1523
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,240
physics so that was in 2019 so it's been

1524
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,119
several years since then and like

1525
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,960
particular

1526
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,480
allegedly slash

1527
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,880
accidentally or intentionally is a pun

1528
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,599
so it can mean specific

1529
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,760
like a physics for the specific systems

1530
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,039
that we're modeling

1531
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,119
or it could be specific like this is a

1532
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,839
specific approach

1533
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:53,359
another interpretation is like it's for

1534
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,319
particulate entities

1535
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,079
when we define thing

1536
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,839
and the partition

1537
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,160
which is going to co-instantiate like

1538
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,599
the generative model and the generative

1539
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,599
process and then the markov blanket or

1540
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,319
the interface that's separating them

1541
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,079
that is

1542
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,000
separating the figure from ground it's

1543
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
separating like the entity from the

1544
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,119
niche

1545
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,400
it's separating what from what

1546
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,240
what what can it represent the

1547
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,599
separation of something from

1548
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,000
all possible separations

1549
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,880
some separations

1550
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,319
and then

1551
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,079
matthew you mentioned like yeah

1552
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,160
verbalizing speech

1553
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,640
but it feels like we're speaking

1554
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,880
[Music]

1555
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,280
maths sometimes

1556
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,319
yet verbalization is a process

1557
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:47,000
especially um dialogue yes matthew

1558
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,760
could i ask a question that brings in a

1559
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,599
little bit of content from the other

1560
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,440
chapters of the book is that

1561
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,960
yeah sure

1562
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,240
i'm just kind of curious because when

1563
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,920
you're talking about those um you're

1564
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,240
talking about the markov blankets

1565
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,480
and integrating it into this idea of how

1566
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,440
we draw boundaries i'm kind of curious

1567
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,599
is it fair to say

1568
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,680
that to the extent we've drawn our

1569
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,920
boundaries and do see

1570
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,240
a reduction of free energy in this

1571
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,119
system it reinforces the idea that

1572
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,480
there's something

1573
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,480
to that

1574
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,640
boundary structure as an entity in the

1575
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,400
world that there's a reality to that is

1576
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,799
that a fair interpretation

1577
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,559
i think many people would have a lot to

1578
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,520
say and add this touches on like the

1579
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,520
question of reification of scientific

1580
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,520
models

1581
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,640
and

1582
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,119
the ability for an identified

1583
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,799
statistical model

1584
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,760
to be like transcending itself

1585
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,400
and used in a realist way

1586
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,960
like ontologically real about true

1587
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,799
joints of the world

1588
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,039
and um

1589
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,440
i'm going to go to live stream table

1590
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,440
and find several of the

1591
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,599
of those who explained their research on

1592
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,920
this topic

1593
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,760
but even short return to claim it's real

1594
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,359
like is it just

1595
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,440
does that ability like once we've drawn

1596
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,839
a boundary um using these markov

1597
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:17,120
blankets uh and we do see that

1598
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,279
it seems to be let's say using

1599
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,600
information to um

1600
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,399
self-evidence

1601
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,600
do we think that that's i mean it seems

1602
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,520
like the the the

1603
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,319
this

1604
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,000
you know this paradigm of thought is

1605
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,479
predicated on the idea that um to the

1606
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,158
extent that that occurs and reduces free

1607
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,158
energy it shouldn't track or further

1608
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,399
attract attention at the very least for

1609
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,920
examination or investigation

1610
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,520
yes so great questions jakob do you have

1611
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,520
something to add on that or or is it a

1612
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,000
slightly different area

1613
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,158
i guess i guess it's kind of related um

1614
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,238
to the to the mark of blanket discussion

1615
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,359
um

1616
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,000
i

1617
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,600
know this

1618
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,120
this may be completely wrong but it

1619
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,520
seems to me like with

1620
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,719
um

1621
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:03,839
that this

1622
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,080
kind of discretization of the markov

1623
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,158
blankets forces us to

1624
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,960
a specific kind of discrete thinking

1625
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,198
but i feel like that

1626
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,279
just this model of a of a markov blanket

1627
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,359
i think of it as a kind of classical

1628
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,640
model but

1629
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,120
i presume that the reality is more

1630
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,198
something like a schroedinger

1631
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,198
markov blanket where

1632
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,520
it's not we can't really draw boundaries

1633
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,719
between

1634
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,319
thinking and

1635
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,560
observing a generative process

1636
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,479
uh in the same way that we can't think

1637
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:37,839
of

1638
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,238
say electrons as balls bouncing off each

1639
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:41,600
other but

1640
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,120
they're not really we can think of them

1641
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,198
as classical particles and that will

1642
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,640
help us

1643
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,399
um to an extent

1644
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,359
but

1645
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,439
then we can also observe

1646
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,920
um the process of thinking so thinking

1647
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,840
is also kind of

1648
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,880
entangled with the generative process

1649
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,560
so there's

1650
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,840
so even though the markov blanket is a

1651
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,320
useful formalism i think

1652
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,000
that there will be

1653
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,440
that there are definitely certain

1654
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,040
scenarios that

1655
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,719
um

1656
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:13,600
in which

1657
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,280
it's more like a probabilistic well it's

1658
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,520
already probabilistic but

1659
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,120
in the sense that

1660
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,159
the

1661
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,040
entity that's performing inference

1662
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,239
also

1663
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:29,040
in its own inference

1664
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,280
um loop

1665
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,600
um performs inference on itself

1666
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,960
and therefore

1667
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,760
thinking is at the same time an action

1668
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,520
but at the same time it's

1669
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,800
part of the generative process

1670
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,239
okay another

1671
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,520
angle on this

1672
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,080
thanks jacob is what dean

1673
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,320
d often talks about with like active

1674
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,480
inference as a framework or a filter and

1675
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,679
these are just sort of like you know

1676
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,280
different distinctions that might be

1677
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,000
transiently useful in some axis like

1678
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,239
fitting something to a framework

1679
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,719
it's kind of the procrustes bed stretch

1680
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,960
it out so that this perception

1681
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,360
and then active as a filter is was

1682
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,520
reminding me of what matthew was saying

1683
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,640
like going out and discovering

1684
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,880
divergences from expectation of there

1685
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,239
not being metabolic activity on a planet

1686
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,760
and then there is some statistical

1687
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,040
deviation

1688
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,040
and so like in the classical statistical

1689
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,880
framework that might be like it's a one

1690
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,719
sigma difference

1691
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,080
in the bayesian

1692
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,239
framework well there's a bayes factor of

1693
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:41,440
two and

1694
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,120
here for this

1695
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
evidence

1696
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,760
and there's other ways to like talk

1697
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,960
about

1698
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,360
detection of novel entities that might

1699
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,239
be part of like a reification process

1700
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,600
of the

1701
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,679
extended cognition of the modelers

1702
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,360
and then like one philosophical angle on

1703
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:05,759
that and then also anyone who who um

1704
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,280
wants to then ali is um this book by

1705
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,880
helen longino

1706
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,679
which

1707
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,480
talks about methodological pluralism

1708
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,760
and about how there can be like

1709
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,760
disciplinary rigor

1710
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,000
and the ways in which often unstated

1711
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,440
like social priors can

1712
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,560
be

1713
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,199
the substance of what becomes

1714
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,520
understood to be science

1715
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,080
as like a complex phenomena

1716
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,840
um ali and then

1717
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,480
brock adding to what jacob said um

1718
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,239
i i think the

1719
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,120
the concept of marco blanket emanates

1720
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,080
from the plutonian

1721
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,400
way of thinking uh

1722
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,080
specifically the

1723
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,239
hylomorphism uh school of thought uh as

1724
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,600
um

1725
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,199
as opposed to hylozoism uh well the

1726
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,280
distinction between hydromorphism and

1727
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,159
hydrozoism is that uh well in

1728
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,239
hilomorphism

1729
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,520
everything is disconnected every concept

1730
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,040
is disconnected

1731
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,560
and

1732
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,120
with every other concept and so there's

1733
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,360
a discontinuity a metaphysical

1734
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,640
discontinuity uh between the concepts uh

1735
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,159
but um

1736
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:25,840
in hilozoism uh the philosophers uh

1737
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,560
advocating this uh

1738
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,719
school of thought uh

1739
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,400
well they claimed that hylomorphism

1740
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,719
fails at uh answering uh the question of

1741
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,480
what it is adequately and so and they

1742
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,840
even rephrased the the question and they

1743
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,880
claim that the right question to ask is

1744
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,040
not what it is

1745
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,600
it's what it can do

1746
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,920
so that's basically the distinction

1747
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,120
between hylomorphism and hylosoism

1748
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,480
but i think

1749
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,640
the markov blanket

1750
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,960
is a way of

1751
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,440
formalizing this

1752
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,199
hylomorphic

1753
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,199
way of thinking

1754
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:15,000
at least that's my opinion

1755
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,120
thanks a lot for that ollie eric

1756
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,320
sorry i'm not hearing eric you can

1757
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,280
others hear eric

1758
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,000
maybe i need to reload

1759
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,440
come here

1760
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,919
okay i'm gonna reload

1761
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,780
[Music]

1762
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,560
can you hear me yeah now i can hear blue

1763
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,239
okay okay you're still not hearing eric

1764
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,040
though

1765
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,800
no sorry

1766
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,320
yeah i just did like a small disrupt

1767
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,679
um

1768
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,480
okay

1769
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,520
i'm gonna

1770
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,760
okay wait eric try again okay how about

1771
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,600
now yeah now it's now i can see you in

1772
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,800
here again okay

1773
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,360
how about everyone else

1774
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,280
who's the audience

1775
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,640
okay wow

1776
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,640
disrupt in the um on the high-level

1777
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,840
field

1778
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,199
it's happened before

1779
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,560
um

1780
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,640
i would i just throw in my two cents

1781
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,000
about um

1782
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,679
my interpretation of a markup blanket

1783
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:42,719
it's about

1784
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,040
trying to make um

1785
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,400
to

1786
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,000
perform simplifications that make

1787
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,239
computation tractable

1788
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,000
um if you have everything interacting

1789
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
with everything else then we can't do

1790
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,360
computing on that so we um

1791
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,280
we apply

1792
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,719
compartmentalization and build objects

1793
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,960
and interfaces for how the objects

1794
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,960
interact with one another

1795
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,159
um

1796
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,840
and

1797
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,360
those become tractable that's what um

1798
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,480
you know

1799
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,880
what a bayes net does is it says what

1800
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,600
are independent and what are dependent

1801
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,239
you know variables on each other

1802
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:26,000
and um that works well when those

1803
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,400
abstractions the objects and relations

1804
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,239
the nouns and verbs

1805
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,159
are a good fit to how the world actually

1806
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,199
operates so that is a driver for

1807
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,840
learning or building representations

1808
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,880
that will use these markov blankets in

1809
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,040
and put the compartments where they

1810
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,120
actually are faithful to the way to the

1811
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,640
compartmentalization

1812
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,400
that we can abstract over the way the

1813
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,640
world parts of the world operate so

1814
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,360
things that are distant that separate

1815
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,920
uh that interact only weekly we try to

1816
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,760
maybe factor those out pretend they

1817
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,080
don't interact at all or use some other

1818
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,080
intermediate variables to to represent

1819
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,920
the interaction in order to simplify

1820
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,679
things so we can do computation so

1821
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,760
that's that's how i think marco blankets

1822
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,360
and we'll see if the math tells us that

1823
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,000
later on when we get to it

1824
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,239
awesome brock

1825
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,639
ethan lee

1826
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,199
okay i'm like not hearing brock

1827
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,920
unfortunately do you

1828
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,080
yes we all hear brock brook is reloading

1829
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,080
i think now again okay

1830
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,440
yeah gather does this sometimes

1831
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,320
but

1832
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,000
i don't know if it's if it's because we

1833
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,239
have 15 people

1834
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,760
yeah but it's yeah like matthew said i

1835
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,960
don't see i don't hear him it's just

1836
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,239
like there's different drop-offs

1837
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,440
um

1838
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,199
i can i can hear you but i still think

1839
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,040
daniel can't hear you daniel you can't

1840
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,960
wait now you're back

1841
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,640
go for it okay continue

1842
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,480
interesting can you hear me yeah oh okay

1843
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,840
um

1844
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,360
yeah no this is this is just this

1845
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,679
ongoing thing that i don't know we just

1846
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:08,400
keep

1847
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,120
keeps coming up about yeah well okay

1848
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,199
maybe they exist maybe they don't mark

1849
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,840
up blankets really but like

1850
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,600
how would they form

1851
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,520
in any

1852
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,320
um

1853
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,080
like how how would they form and evolve

1854
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,280
and collapse and

1855
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,719
presumably

1856
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,840
there is some point in

1857
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,800
in that process this like evolution part

1858
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,000
where

1859
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,360
uh the markov blanket is

1860
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,000
extremely poorly defined

1861
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,960
uh

1862
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,600
like relative to the system

1863
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,920
right and that's basically

1864
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,800
these

1865
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,360
sort of under explored areas it was was

1866
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,440
also in relation to matthew's question

1867
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,040
also about um

1868
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,000
the free energy minimization thing where

1869
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,360
there's systems like non-equilibrium

1870
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,679
systems basically where

1871
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:00,719
um

1872
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,360
still something interesting worth you

1873
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,159
know

1874
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,400
worthy of study is happening

1875
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,440
but

1876
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,480
perhaps

1877
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,880
is not um

1878
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,960
free energy minimizing

1879
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,679
um at that

1880
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,320
in that state

1881
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,640
thanks for sharing it just a few

1882
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,520
thoughts

1883
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,440
like um

1884
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,679
[Music]

1885
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,080
just because so let's just say some sort

1886
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,719
of

1887
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,960
mesoscale or global as that's called but

1888
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,400
that doesn't mean about the whole world

1889
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,320
but some sort of global free energy

1890
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,880
minimization in the joint model is

1891
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,239
achieved like in a conversation

1892
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,600
that isn't the same thing as the local

1893
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,920
disconnected free energy minimization

1894
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,840
otherwise fitting

1895
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,719
high parameter models optimally would be

1896
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,880
simply reducing to fitting single

1897
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,120
dimensional models

1898
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,719
alone if we could just do the linear

1899
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,360
optimization on the standalone variables

1900
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,440
then why would we ever need the larger

1901
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,920
dimensional methods

1902
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,280
and then

1903
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,960
um

1904
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,000
like think of this textbook

1905
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,760
maybe with where things could be in the

1906
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,440
coming years

1907
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,800
the one the the the markov membrane

1908
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,880
is like the linear algebra

1909
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,400
and then jakob mentioned that this is

1910
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,239
classical model

1911
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,440
it is kind of classical in a sense

1912
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,960
in the the timeless classic sense

1913
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,000
so

1914
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,320
the one layer marco blanket

1915
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,400
when thinking about like the rise and

1916
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,440
fall of

1917
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,000
civilization is not

1918
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,639
the end all that's like i think

1919
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,480
maybe analogous to

1920
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,600
a linear regression y equals mx plus b

1921
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,920
and then you have like the height all

1922
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,000
these 100 years of development on the

1923
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,760
linear regression

1924
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,800
model

1925
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,400
and all these techniques and

1926
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,880
applications and pipelines

1927
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,679
so

1928
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,800
the mark i'll blanket one layer

1929
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,960
potentially over interpreting it as

1930
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,560
already presenting with strengths or

1931
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,159
weaknesses

1932
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,840
in certain situations

1933
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,520
when not being just like empirically

1934
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,199
demonstrated

1935
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,080
in the general case

1936
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,920
we'll see what could be said and when

1937
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,320
matthew

1938
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,360
yeah um along those lines i was kind of

1939
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,960
curious i've seen that there's been a

1940
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,120
decent amount of work on the sort of

1941
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,440
hierarchical or fractal composition of

1942
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,480
these models um i'm curious if

1943
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,360
that implies that there's a fractality

1944
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,320
to the boundary by default or if they're

1945
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,880
like is there any specific work on

1946
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,040
sort of hierarchical composition of the

1947
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,960
boundaries of that so-called membrane as

1948
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,280
you said

1949
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,600
with better annotation we could have

1950
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,760
better answers because

1951
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,920
there's many papers that we've discussed

1952
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,480
in a guest stream or a paper and there's

1953
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,239
also like many other papers obviously

1954
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,199
that

1955
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,400
that we don't have that kind of

1956
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,080
annotations of

1957
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,880
um

1958
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,840
because

1959
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,120
it's quite common to see nested

1960
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,639
models

1961
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,960
in the context of

1962
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,880
nesting of cognitive processes like in

1963
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,880
that sanfed smith paper which was i

1964
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,560
think number 25

1965
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,880
that was about cognition as mental

1966
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,760
action

1967
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,360
so that was nested and the nesting and

1968
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,520
was interpreted as cognitive actions and

1969
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,440
counterfactuals

1970
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,080
basically and then sometimes nesting is

1971
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,880
used to refer to actual like well

1972
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,199
the state is inside of the country and

1973
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,480
then the region is inside of the state

1974
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,480
like it's it's implied

1975
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,239
that the map is mapping on to the

1976
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,679
territory

1977
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,239
maybe even spatially the cell is inside

1978
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,320
of the tissue

1979
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,239
and that's like answering schrodinger's

1980
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,679
question

1981
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,679
everything happening with the planetary

1982
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,760
scale analyses

1983
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,760
cellular level

1984
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,050
um

1985
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,880
[Music]

1986
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,360
and then this is

1987
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,760
hopefully what is uh spoken to with like

1988
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,560
the composability of active inference

1989
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,480
and sometimes that's frame in terms of

1990
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,679
like the the lateral composability

1991
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,600
of like how you could have three ants

1992
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:16,000
interacting or 300 ants and then the the

1993
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,239
nested composability

1994
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,760
you could have the fifth and the seventh

1995
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,760
and all those layers

1996
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,760
with computational tradeoffs maybe with

1997
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,159
no extra information to be gleaned

1998
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:27,040
and then

1999
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,440
learning the structure of the generative

2000
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,280
model or just the structure of the

2001
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,400
partition

2002
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,000
more broadly and like what the variables

2003
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,520
are and everything

2004
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,840
that's the structured learning

2005
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,520
challenge

2006
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,639
and

2007
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,320
cognition as structured learning

2008
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,199
synergetics geometry of thought

2009
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,679
is what fristen has

2010
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,760
and others have raised

2011
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,400
as like a total open area

2012
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,679
because there's the parameter

2013
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,280
fine-tuning

2014
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,480
once you have the bayes graph

2015
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,040
so then you're you're you're now inside

2016
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,880
of the ability to like

2017
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,840
to reify or not that model

2018
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,320
you're just doing parameter optimization

2019
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,080
you know we used two factors in this

2020
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,080
linear regression and then we optimized

2021
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,719
it with the l2 norm two is the best

2022
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,320
number of factors

2023
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,199
but that it couldn't be said at that

2024
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,520
scale you could say in a two parameter

2025
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,000
model this is the best parameters

2026
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,760
with this norm

2027
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,760
but then you couldn't pull back another

2028
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,360
level

2029
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,719
and so that's like

2030
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:38,000
meta scientific and metabasian analyses

2031
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,280
which they're going to talk about like

2032
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,440
later

2033
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,440
okay yeah i guess i'm also kind of

2034
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,199
wondering if there are any uh examples

2035
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,280
that come to mind of something like a

2036
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,679
system that is structured such as

2037
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,199
the clearest or simplest example that

2038
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,480
comes to mind is like let's say that you

2039
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,320
have a nation and a

2040
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,480
state within that nation and there is a

2041
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,600
port and there is an overlap of sort of

2042
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,600
that port interface to an outside

2043
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,520
structure that is shared by both the

2044
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,000
national and overlapping national and

2045
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,719
state interests and decision processes

2046
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,280
um and so i'm kind of curious if there

2047
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,760
are examples of demonstrating that kind

2048
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,080
of composability of generative models

2049
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,840
um or if that's something that's still

2050
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,360
just new and open

2051
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,400
those are awesome questions if people

2052
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,679
know any

2053
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:28,560
um

2054
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,679
some areas to investigate like in the

2055
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,199
phenomena that you're you know

2056
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:36,320
overlapping interests informally

2057
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,080
there would be like shared regimes of

2058
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,280
attention

2059
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,440
there's the question of synchrony

2060
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,440
and that doesn't mean like um

2061
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,440
synchronization

2062
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,600
identically but generalized synchrony

2063
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,600
then there's like coordination of

2064
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,600
affordances

2065
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,120
we're not going to do this because of

2066
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,360
that so that's like

2067
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,320
um

2068
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,239
in an area that that jacob and others

2069
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,719
have been working on is just describing

2070
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,239
that situation

2071
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:10,000
as an affordance on an affordance

2072
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,040
or like e sub e like it it's not in the

2073
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,560
textbook but you know if people are

2074
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,000
staying this long then this is just kind

2075
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,440
of some ways that some people are

2076
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,280
thinking about it and these are the

2077
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,440
areas where people can also do research

2078
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,800
and learning with us

2079
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,000
but like

2080
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,600
affordance is on affordances

2081
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,600
the safety could be on or off so then

2082
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,199
there's like an affordance that modifies

2083
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:35,040
another affordance and could those have

2084
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,199
compositionality

2085
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,600
just like some of these other

2086
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,560
um

2087
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,400
generalization

2088
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,199
affordances for generalization basically

2089
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,480
what are those

2090
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,320
and then isn't it like discovering what

2091
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,639
those are

2092
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,320
just

2093
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,199
really i think uh it's kind of also

2094
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,360
related to that question of this

2095
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,120
formation evolution collapse of markup

2096
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,120
blankets is when

2097
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,000
when

2098
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,040
does the observation actions of one

2099
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,800
system

2100
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,440
map to the

2101
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,679
to the preferences of another and vice

2102
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,679
versa how does that

2103
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,560
come into

2104
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,719
being existence how does that start to

2105
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,719
happen and how does it

2106
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:29,920
unhappen

2107
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,840
i don't

2108
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,400
know

2109
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,560
awesome question thank you and and

2110
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,960
another like angle on that

2111
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,520
let me just check um and then ali is

2112
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,960
like this is a graph that we're going to

2113
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,280
look at a ton and we will interpret what

2114
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,719
all of it means

2115
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,040
what is the o a s b

2116
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,520
pi g etc

2117
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,199
but

2118
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,040
this is a bayesian graph like eric

2119
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,320
mentioned and the edges are like

2120
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,040
dependencies not causal influences in

2121
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,280
the world but apparent potentially or

2122
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,120
different interpretations

2123
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,639
is this the only skeleton

2124
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:05,440
no

2125
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,760
this is the y equals mx plus b of

2126
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,679
skeletons

2127
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,159
and there's the the linear regression in

2128
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,000
the first equation in the textbook of

2129
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,320
the stats textbook and then there's all

2130
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,480
these accessory tests

2131
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,520
then there's like creation and

2132
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,880
destruction

2133
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,040
as applied

2134
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,400
maybe there can just be a loop that's

2135
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,080
not active inference just checking every

2136
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,480
day if something's within an arbitrary

2137
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,760
threshold

2138
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,239
so there could be some

2139
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,040
liminal or gray area

2140
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,560
like an interface

2141
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,159
i think steven salette mentioned it as

2142
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,159
like a nail bed or something

2143
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,600
like an interface between more

2144
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,840
particulate and then less particulate

2145
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,040
more more

2146
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:45,920
field

2147
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,679
versus the particle

2148
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,000
ali

2149
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,199
well as a little side note

2150
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,440
there's a popular science book coming

2151
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,080
out i think in june uh namely the

2152
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,520
romance of reality by bob yazarian uh

2153
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,360
which uh touches on uh the uh

2154
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,040
uh the emergence of markup blankets uh

2155
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,239
the dynamics of the emergence of markup

2156
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:16,000
blankets and it

2157
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,560
uh attacks um

2158
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,719
attacks attacks it from

2159
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:24,159
many different angles evolutionary angle

2160
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,159
i mean from a cosmic even uh perspective

2161
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:32,799
and uh it even goes for goes

2162
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,840
as far as uh

2163
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,719
well

2164
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,040
considering the whole cosmos the whole

2165
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,080
universe

2166
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,520
uh as

2167
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,199
um

2168
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,280
let's say a kind of

2169
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,560
meta

2170
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,920
metamark of blankets uh so to speak and

2171
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,840
uh well uh i think uh that

2172
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,880
could be an interesting thought

2173
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,600
uh put forward by bobby azarian in this

2174
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,560
book all right thanks daniel

2175
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,400
thanks um in fact he gave part one of

2176
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,360
what was

2177
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,440
uh intended and may still be like a

2178
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,719
multiple part

2179
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,320
discussion

2180
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,159
but this was him giving that

2181
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,799
presentation

2182
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,000
so

2183
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,440
we were in contact is definitely you

2184
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,760
know it's an interesting view

2185
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,400
and it's going to take all kinds of

2186
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,639
research and and education and

2187
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,320
communication

2188
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,719
jessica

2189
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,320
yes i mean i guess um

2190
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,400
when i like first like joined the lab

2191
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,360
like some of the sort of like um ideas

2192
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,840
that helped me a little bit like to want

2193
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,080
like to start even like

2194
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,120
conceptualizing this um i mean in

2195
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,639
addition to the filter that you

2196
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,280
mentioned before daniel and like how

2197
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,080
like

2198
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,360
it could be like

2199
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,679
more like porous or a lot like or more

2200
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,000
hard and allow things in and out

2201
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,440
but it was also um about like

2202
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,199
it could be like i'm just grouping of

2203
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,760
relationships and an interaction so like

2204
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,400
the closer like a relationship like

2205
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,560
different things art and

2206
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,239
maybe that's more like on biological

2207
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,800
systems i don't know like if

2208
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,880
they're closely related

2209
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,880
or they have like more interactions even

2210
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,639
though they might be different but

2211
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,120
like grouping it in those sense

2212
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,040
and maybe that's relates to what eric

2213
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,560
said and from the calculational part

2214
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,480
and but that was sort of like you know

2215
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,400
some of the things like when i started

2216
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,440
connecting on markov blankets too

2217
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,960
uh i started like okay if

2218
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,080
you know

2219
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,400
items or like different objects and

2220
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,600
things like they're closely related

2221
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,840
you can start like putting on like a

2222
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,000
blanket around on

2223
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,920
and maybe go so like with the idea of

2224
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,960
wrapping things on

2225
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,719
from some of the definitions but yeah

2226
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,159
those are kind of like the kind of

2227
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,159
visual ideas that i

2228
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:03,840
you know started like helping me a

2229
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,440
little bit uh and i still like don't

2230
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,360
understand properly but those are the

2231
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,000
things i was like okay so relationships

2232
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,199
filters um like

2233
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,679
kind of like connecting interactions and

2234
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,560
between things

2235
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,719
awesome thanks a lot for that like

2236
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,639
interacting entities

2237
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,880
so you could

2238
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,639
have the edges representing some

2239
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,239
interaction

2240
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,840
like when people are fitting a linear

2241
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,480
model interacting variables

2242
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,320
so there's this whole

2243
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,159
discussion topic of whether the

2244
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,239
interactions are like the two ants

2245
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,760
bumping into each other

2246
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,520
whatever that means in the quote real

2247
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,320
world

2248
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,840
and then there's like the statistical

2249
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,440
interaction

2250
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,560
so

2251
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,120
then defining certain variables in

2252
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,880
statistical models so leaving that

2253
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,400
debate behind us

2254
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,920
and just talking about the statistical

2255
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,600
models that we have bayesian graphs

2256
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,239
some variables have edges between them

2257
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,159
that could be either like designed to

2258
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,080
there be there or not

2259
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,440
or you could do some sort of like

2260
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,440
thresholding approach and explore that

2261
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,679
your thresholding parameter was

2262
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,480
acceptable but like the more of a loose

2263
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,320
interaction you allow

2264
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,320
the the more challenge there is to fit

2265
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,159
that statistical model

2266
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,239
and you may not have enough data to fit

2267
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:24,480
like the 10 variable by 10 variable with

2268
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,320
all the interaction terms

2269
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,920
which is like why would doing linear

2270
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,520
modeling in

2271
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,159
a health population example

2272
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:34,400
they would like do model selection

2273
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,440
on what their statistical power is

2274
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,920
with that data set to resolve certain

2275
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,760
kinds of effects and correlations and

2276
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,440
like non-sphericities

2277
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,920
and that is addressed a lot in the spm

2278
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,360
textbook

2279
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,840
and firstin's earlier like pre-active

2280
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:52,960
work

2281
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,120
but then you mentioned like

2282
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,600
how to like be engaged with that process

2283
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,400
of like the wrapping or the seeing the

2284
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,159
clusters and knowing like where is there

2285
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,760
going to be like maybe generative models

2286
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,320
arising that are

2287
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,560
consisting of other generative models or

2288
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,400
other generative processes

2289
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,080
and then like some things interact more

2290
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,520
with others

2291
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,800
statistically

2292
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,520
in the model as by design or just as an

2293
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,040
outcome of

2294
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,480
whatever

2295
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,560
so there's sparse connectivity amongst

2296
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,480
the variables they're not like all by

2297
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,159
all connected

2298
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,840
and then that sparse connectivity

2299
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,000
simplifies a lot of things that's also

2300
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,400
related to like a lasso regression

2301
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,159
and also to the

2302
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,400
below l2 norms

2303
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,000
and then a sparse model can be

2304
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,840
factorized

2305
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,600
and that is what allows for the

2306
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,840
variational bayesian inference which is

2307
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,480
like doing bayesian model fitting

2308
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,480
on a factorized

2309
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,159
because it's sparsely connected graph

2310
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,159
and so a lot of these discussions are

2311
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,040
quite

2312
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,480
downstream

2313
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,480
of a lot of the philosophy of map and

2314
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,800
territory but it's still super important

2315
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,320
conversation

2316
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,560
however within the model

2317
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,239
inference with a model inference using a

2318
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,560
model

2319
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,400
a lot of these questions are are very

2320
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,920
technical

2321
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,440
and downstream

2322
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,040
of importance

2323
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,400
qualitative things that are also

2324
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,360
important to keep in mind

2325
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,040
but of a different type

2326
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:29,839
jessica or anyone else

2327
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,799
yeah wow very interesting

2328
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,320
here's one other question i guess we can

2329
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,400
discuss like

2330
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,719
as the as it currently stands there's a

2331
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,560
one hour meeting

2332
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,159
and then at the end of the very next

2333
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,760
hour begins

2334
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,239
the dot tools regular organizational

2335
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,159
unit meeting

2336
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,679
so

2337
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,840
is there i mean it is the people who are

2338
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,320
here now but hopefully others would be

2339
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,679
listening to it if they're not able to

2340
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,639
make this time but like

2341
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,480
what will help people with the

2342
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,119
synchronous and asynchronous

2343
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:13,280
make the most of the next few months

2344
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,119
do people appreciate having a longer

2345
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,199
discussion

2346
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,960
for this

2347
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,040
do people think that the

2348
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,400
main versus the math group like is there

2349
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,639
another subgroup like a philosophy

2350
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:28,159
discussion that people want to like kind

2351
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,760
of

2352
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,719
really

2353
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,960
do this

2354
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,960
because we're not like

2355
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,639
we don't we're experimenting with

2356
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,199
open-endedness on our first cohort and

2357
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,920
in these early phases of the book

2358
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,159
and people can probably imagine various

2359
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:45,760
of like the things we want to balance

2360
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,920
like respecting everyone's time

2361
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,520
and different backgrounds respecting

2362
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,080
their preferences for

2363
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,360
how much they want to learn about

2364
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,199
different topics

2365
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,440
being realistic about how much

2366
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,400
asynchronous and synchronous

2367
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,400
direct and peripheral

2368
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,400
time makes sense

2369
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,560
but also being realistic like

2370
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,560
there isn't a two-minute video for a

2371
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,800
process

2372
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,800
so how do people think about like that

2373
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,840
those who have stayed

2374
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:21,480
this far

2375
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,840
mike and then anyone else

2376
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
can you hear me yes

2377
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,960
okay

2378
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,320
um

2379
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,840
yeah i think that

2380
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,760
as noted earlier in the discussion there

2381
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,760
are just so many themes that run through

2382
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,800
this

2383
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,199
um that there are opportunities to

2384
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,360
pull on any of a number of threads in

2385
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,159
the course of discussion and so

2386
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,000
uh today's discussion was interesting

2387
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,679
and i stayed

2388
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,760
for this part of this the discussion um

2389
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,159
simply because of the interesting

2390
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,800
threads that were being pulled

2391
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,719
certainly a contrast with the first part

2392
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,119
of the discussion around math and i

2393
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,119
think a lot of uncertainty

2394
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,360
amongst the attendees about

2395
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,280
how to engage with the mathematical

2396
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,840
aspects and so

2397
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,480
maybe to try and put a point on it

2398
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,000
um

2399
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,320
from my perspective

2400
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,960
learning about uh what is active

2401
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,560
inference and how can active inference

2402
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,080
be applied in real world situations

2403
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,280
is a motivator for me participating

2404
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,639
um

2405
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,400
obviously there are also sort of

2406
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,719
philosophical and maybe more scientific

2407
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:55,920
discussions

2408
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,600
that can take place and

2409
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,880
so

2410
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:01,920
any

2411
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,239
any meeting could touch on any of those

2412
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,800
aspects uh as well as some of the

2413
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,800
asynchronous interaction could pick

2414
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,000
those up as well

2415
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,560
thanks a lot

2416
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,560
okay anyone can raise their hand here's

2417
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,840
just a few other

2418
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,199
options like if somebody here's

2419
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,880
something that's interesting to them we

2420
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,760
can

2421
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,280
in the discord

2422
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,679
make a channel

2423
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,840
that is relate or people can participate

2424
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,520
in the regular channels just like

2425
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,440
questions like or and that's going to

2426
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,639
potentially be

2427
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,320
seen and interacted with by people more

2428
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,880
broadly like what if we posted questions

2429
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,800
that we're having

2430
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,800
we're in the cohort one of the texts we

2431
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,119
you know had this question

2432
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,080
do you know

2433
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,080
that's one option another

2434
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,119
um and this is like to mike's um

2435
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:51,040
expression that applied active inference

2436
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:51,920
is a

2437
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,600
motivator

2438
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,400
epistemic and pragmatic value

2439
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,639
expected epistemic value we expect to

2440
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,679
learn a lot by like staying in these

2441
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,239
sometimes

2442
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,080
challenging or oblique or whatever

2443
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,440
discussions

2444
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,280
but then there's also expected pragmatic

2445
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,400
value

2446
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,639
with applying active inference learning

2447
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,880
and applying active inference

2448
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,560
so then

2449
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,239
maybe that is a group we can partition

2450
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:21,600
like

2451
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,159
an applied active inference group so

2452
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,600
then

2453
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,639
we can

2454
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,480
be clear about what the focal artifact

2455
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,679
is

2456
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,239
because also we want to like

2457
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,280
not

2458
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,920
all groups at all times will be able to

2459
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,960
have

2460
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,000
uh nor is it useful to have open-ended

2461
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,600
discussions of any discursion length

2462
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,400
so like knowing how far and in what ways

2463
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,239
and how many minutes of people's linear

2464
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:50,000
time

2465
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,840
um ali

2466
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,360
yes

2467
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,440
the edu meetings

2468
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,360
um just one note on the organizational

2469
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,239
unit meetings the organization units in

2470
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,320
the active lab like edu

2471
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,400
comms and tools for education

2472
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,159
communication and tools

2473
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:08,159
are like directory

2474
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,080
one-hour

2475
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,360
lab meetings

2476
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,920
or group meetings because we're not

2477
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:14,880
doing

2478
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,880
the education work necessarily in that

2479
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,960
one hour but some groups sometimes it's

2480
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,719
possible to do some stuff

2481
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,159
but it's like

2482
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,480
increasingly moving towards

2483
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,159
sharing updates

2484
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,760
from people who want to commit in

2485
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,000
asynchronous work or smaller groups that

2486
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,679
want to commit to doing something like

2487
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:32,800
that

2488
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,960
so then

2489
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,639
educational related projects that's

2490
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:38,719
their opportunity to ask for help share

2491
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,920
updates and so on

2492
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,119
but

2493
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:44,960
earlier on there was more topical

2494
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,639
material

2495
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:47,679
but then

2496
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:48,560
through

2497
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,840
particularization and operations

2498
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,000
and other approaches

2499
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,800
it becomes more like pragmatic and less

2500
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
discovery and less mixed media role

2501
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,880
specification all these processes so

2502
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,360
people sticking around is sort of the

2503
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,119
and being engaged and like seeing an

2504
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,040
affordance and then just making that

2505
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,560
contribution

2506
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,239
wanting to be a facilitator for a

2507
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,840
certain project or wanting to contribute

2508
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,360
actively or just even connect with

2509
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,199
another participant

2510
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:18,639
like you can

2511
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,560
email them if they've provided their

2512
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,119
information

2513
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,440
just some random things but like

2514
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,840
we want to have the applied

2515
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,719
angle the philosophical loop

2516
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:35,040
and how to even partition that

2517
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,600
discussion

2518
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,239
like we couldn't just over go every math

2519
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,880
every philosophy every applied question

2520
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,239
and have

2521
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,159
the judge and the jury

2522
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:50,080
and all this apparatus

2523
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,080
so

2524
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,920
how can we scaffold that conversation

2525
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,840
around applied active inference for the

2526
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,360
people who are like super excited and

2527
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,559
motivated mike

2528
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,800
yeah i just want to add

2529
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,119
there's an interesting duality related

2530
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:07,760
to what you just said in that we can't

2531
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,719
go into fine detail in all of the

2532
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:11,760
content

2533
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,560
um and at the same time i've found this

2534
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,760
group

2535
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,880
to be remarkable at unpacking things and

2536
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,800
sort of

2537
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,400
really getting into

2538
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,119
what we mean when we say that uh types

2539
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,119
of discussions and

2540
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:28,960
uh what does this term mean not taking

2541
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,119
things for your for granted

2542
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:33,760
as going through the text and

2543
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,480
so

2544
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,719
there's a balance to be struck in taking

2545
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,480
that approach of

2546
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,840
asking what do we mean when we're

2547
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,920
talking about this and putting nouns on

2548
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,760
things and relating it to language

2549
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,480
and not going too far over into getting

2550
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:52,678
into fine detail about things

2551
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,040
thank you lyle

2552
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,800
and then i'll leave your question yeah

2553
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,560
this bit this personally great session

2554
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,159
really great conversation i really enjoy

2555
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,800
it this is new much of this most of this

2556
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,280
is new material for me and so

2557
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,880
i'm really enjoying the breadth of the

2558
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,719
conversation and i'm

2559
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,480
cognizant of this uh

2560
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,320
aspect you're digging into is you know

2561
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,679
how much do we

2562
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,760
sort of separate out the pieces and go

2563
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,239
deep dive in different places versus

2564
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:23,520
more of a

2565
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,600
you know touching on multiple threads in

2566
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,119
their interactions

2567
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,159
uh

2568
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,400
for me while i understand there is a

2569
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,520
balance to be struck there i really

2570
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,840
enjoying the

2571
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,800
challenge of relating as an example the

2572
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,040
math to the philosophy

2573
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:41,760
to

2574
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,400
all these different threads

2575
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,960
together because they are linked right

2576
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,320
and and so i do understand that you

2577
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,840
can't

2578
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,199
some of those

2579
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,520
some of those areas

2580
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,280
need a separate group that you can drill

2581
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,920
down into for me personally and so this

2582
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,520
may be not the same as other people in

2583
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,440
the group i'm really enjoying

2584
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,520
understanding the connections the

2585
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,960
philosophy

2586
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,880
how these different thought processes

2587
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,280
came to be through history and get that

2588
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,320
depth of understanding

2589
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,400
thank you um lyle

2590
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,360
and for those who want to like listen

2591
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,800
or view

2592
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,400
these live streams have many many themes

2593
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,000
so check if there's papers that you're

2594
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,080
interested in here

2595
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,199
the live streams is about papers

2596
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,600
so there's 46 papers

2597
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,679
guest streams are not driven by a paper

2598
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,520
sometimes the person's sharing a paper

2599
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,920
but these are like presentations

2600
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,360
hearing from different perspectives and

2601
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,800
if anybody wants to

2602
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,040
help organize these that's what we do in

2603
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,199
comms if they want to facilitate and

2604
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,960
participate in these discussions if they

2605
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,119
want to like contact authors recommend

2606
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,080
papers

2607
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,960
these are all distributed tasks that

2608
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,280
are leverage points for people who care

2609
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,920
to just do a ton of amazing things like

2610
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,360
if somebody's interested to connect it

2611
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:02,639
to a given

2612
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,040
community and make an artifact or live

2613
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,440
stream co-organize that like

2614
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,920
we can catalyze it at the lab scale for

2615
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,679
individuals who know about the

2616
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:13,520
affordance but then want to take that

2617
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:14,719
affordance

2618
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,000
to

2619
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,840
just have really

2620
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,800
leveraged impacts in the active

2621
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,520
ecosystem so ali's question and then

2622
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,520
jessica

2623
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,000
sorry i don't have any questions

2624
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,440
you asked about the timetable for the

2625
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,480
edu

2626
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,520
meetings

2627
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,880
like what specific times are they

2628
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,080
occurring at

2629
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,920
sure yeah okay

2630
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,760
they are on mondays at 13

2631
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,400
and 23 utc

2632
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,639
there's two edu meetings

2633
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,719
to reflect like education being the

2634
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:56,239
primary mission of actin flab and then

2635
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,719
that spreads them out by time zones

2636
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,320
but if somebody really wants to

2637
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,960
contribute to an area

2638
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,280
the organizational unit meeting is not

2639
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,880
the rate limiting step

2640
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,280
anyone who has attention to contribute

2641
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,440
will be able to find a regime of

2642
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,960
attention that is like connected to a

2643
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,960
task that's meaningful the rate limiting

2644
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,840
step is not people's availability for a

2645
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,239
one hour meeting

2646
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:21,520
it's however much time people want to

2647
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,920
contribute whatever practices and things

2648
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,840
will find something that works for

2649
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,480
people who want to be engaged so don't

2650
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,280
take these meeting times as being like

2651
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:33,360
when we're doing it when we're deciding

2652
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,360
even

2653
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,360
anybody who wants to can email or

2654
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,320
contact just the lab email address

2655
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,239
and be started on figuring it that out

2656
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:47,119
um jessica

2657
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,639
um yes this was related to the question

2658
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:54,080
about applied on projects um

2659
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,239
i was thinking that maybe one thing that

2660
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,080
we could do is um

2661
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:01,760
on the project on ideas on cycling to

2662
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,600
have a table and where people can like

2663
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,600
you know briefly share what they want to

2664
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,920
do or like you know use it say like okay

2665
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,920
i'm interested in

2666
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,639
machine learning and apply you know like

2667
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,119
active inference and maybe this specific

2668
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:18,400
topic

2669
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,800
who will be interested in

2670
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,440
discussing this or exploring what to do

2671
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,760
and and then like adding the names of

2672
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,000
the people who would be interested in

2673
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,719
that and so the person who started the

2674
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,960
you know seated the project then they

2675
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,880
can be you know

2676
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,560
can start like maybe contacting those

2677
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,800
people and see like you know what time

2678
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,719
they can meet and start like creating

2679
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,560
their own sub groups um so maybe that's

2680
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,760
something that we could do like to

2681
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,360
facilitate that

2682
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,400
and

2683
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,199
in a simple way um

2684
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,440
yeah so just start like saying like this

2685
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,280
is what i would like to do apply active

2686
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,639
inference while also studying the course

2687
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:57,840
and you know i would like to connect

2688
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,760
with people here who might share the

2689
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:03,040
same interests and and you know see

2690
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,960
what kind of feedback and

2691
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,679
that person can get

2692
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:08,960
thanks

2693
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,960
and just

2694
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,440
connecting and building trust

2695
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,280
and having like a buddy system or small

2696
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,480
groups or just people who are

2697
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:21,440
on the relatively long path

2698
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:25,520
to apply active inference on teams

2699
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,679
we don't have the speed dating

2700
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:28,960
hot swap

2701
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,880
active application

2702
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,719
protocol

2703
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:33,520
but

2704
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,040
connecting with people

2705
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,440
and then

2706
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,199
however it's authentic in that

2707
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:40,880
relationship seeing what you're

2708
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,000
interested in in three months

2709
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,400
will be in a pretty different

2710
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,599
situation

2711
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:49,199
but we still won't have even gone

2712
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:50,239
through

2713
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,800
the second half of the book

2714
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,719
on the application of the textbook

2715
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,880
so there's a there's a lot of time for

2716
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,719
us to

2717
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,800
to develop ideas

2718
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,000
and to connect with each other

2719
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,599
so thanks for sharing that a lot jessica

2720
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,520
and and i tagged you so that we can

2721
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,440
create a table

2722
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,840
with the right way or do it with however

2723
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,360
is the right way

2724
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,760
because it it helps enable connections

2725
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,920
for people who want to

2726
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,199
connect around applying

2727
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:29,040
and also it helps us remember these are

2728
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,199
the specific reference points in the

2729
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:33,119
text

2730
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:34,159
that

2731
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:36,480
are like

2732
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,280
our attractor regime of attention for

2733
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,080
this

2734
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,159
textbook group like the textbook group

2735
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:43,840
isn't all of actin flap if people want

2736
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,000
to apply active inference it doesn't

2737
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,199
have to be

2738
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,360
from the ground up but it totally could

2739
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,239
be

2740
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:51,760
but there's many ways to apply that are

2741
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,000
just in different codas that people get

2742
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,280
can get involved in immediately

2743
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,440
so

2744
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,679
if somebody feels like doing things

2745
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,199
i hope they feel like they have the

2746
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:08,320
agency to do that

2747
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:12,239
okay any final thoughts on this

2748
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:14,879
interesting

2749
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,639
semi-pattern breaking

2750
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,719
and also um

2751
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:21,840
yes

2752
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,320
one final thought for me is uh we would

2753
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,800
have had dot tools organizational unit

2754
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,159
meeting at this time

2755
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,239
which is why near the end

2756
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,159
like asked if you want to do different

2757
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,360
scheduling

2758
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,560
because

2759
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,239
um

2760
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:38,320
in general it's probably not good

2761
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,199
practice or ways of working to like go

2762
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,280
over time

2763
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,119
to respect everyone's time and all of

2764
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,719
these types of things

2765
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:48,880
but also in the future we're in gather

2766
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,800
so people who want to keep discussing

2767
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,080
the textbook

2768
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,320
could go there into a different room

2769
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,480
people want to do tools can go into

2770
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,800
another place

2771
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,000
so we

2772
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,679
need to figure out how to

2773
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,679
do that through the people who want to

2774
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,360
be there like these people and the

2775
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,719
feedback that everybody has and the ways

2776
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:10,960
they want to co-create it tim and then

2777
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,040
anyone else who has like last thoughts

2778
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,560
hey yeah i was just going to say this is

2779
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,320
generally way more interesting than the

2780
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,599
tools meeting generally is so

2781
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,520
this is crossbow true

2782
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,599
pollination shows great potential

2783
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,599
already i would say um

2784
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:27,360
yeah sounds good i just wanted to add to

2785
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,560
that conversation though about uh

2786
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,560
someone even mentioned plato socrates

2787
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,719
and all that uh and that whole sort of

2788
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:35,360
recursive involution of the of the sort

2789
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:38,239
of uh that sort of

2790
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:39,599
rarification thing you were talking

2791
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,159
about and and sort of the the thought

2792
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:43,679
processes maybe being almost like a

2793
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,239
recapitulation of the of the that of the

2794
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:48,080
structure learning and that and the

2795
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,840
corrupt bayesian factor graphs and all

2796
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,800
that kind of thing you were talking

2797
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,560
about there um

2798
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,119
plato had like a concept of knowledge

2799
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,320
which which he referred to as

2800
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,080
recollection

2801
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,679
and and this idea way way back where all

2802
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,599
all learning and knowledge is actually

2803
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,239
an act of recollecting what we already

2804
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:07,040
know

2805
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,239
and i just want to point out there's

2806
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,840
kind of a

2807
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,840
maybe just more of a

2808
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,080
interesting

2809
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,320
uh

2810
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,719
illusion or connection i guess between

2811
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,280
those two whether it seems like a old

2812
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,040
new what's what's old is new again or

2813
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,519
what have you covered

2814
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,040
thanks tim

2815
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,400
anyone else who hasn't spoken or who

2816
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,879
would like to add anything

2817
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:54,199
okay
