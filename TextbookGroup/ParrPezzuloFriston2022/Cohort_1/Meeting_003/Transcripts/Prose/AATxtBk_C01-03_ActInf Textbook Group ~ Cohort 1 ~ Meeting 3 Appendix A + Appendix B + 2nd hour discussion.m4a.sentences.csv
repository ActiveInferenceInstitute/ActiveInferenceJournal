1450	11018	1	A	0.81	Okay, it is May 19, 2022 and it's week three of the textbook group first cohort.
11194	23262	2	A	0.98818	We're in week three discussing appendix A and B and there are some notes in the sections of the book.
23316	24270	3	A	1.0	In the chapters.
25370	29090	4	A	0.50471	There are also some ideas and questions that people have raised.
29250	35026	5	A	0.86572	So we'll go to the questions and then start with the most upvoted.
35058	43130	6	A	0.99991	So feel free to add more upvotes if you want to discuss it, like even in this discussion.
44030	54606	7	A	0.88	And then hopefully if people are available to take notes in this section, that will help add their thoughts in and also capture what the speakers are saying.
54788	65680	8	A	1.0	And then we'll look at the question and then try to come to different answers and just add more information that people can add more structure to later.
67970	73010	9	A	0.65	Okay, the first question says appendix A is described as the mathematical background.
74150	78534	10	A	0.99639	So maybe question one for the authors or for you.
78572	83670	11	A	0.99996	What is the process of determining what is figuring ground for the formalisms of active?
86840	92388	12	A	0.99966	What other math concepts and formalisms are important for learning and applying active inference?
92564	101880	13	A	0.6	And then three, what are some resources and approaches for learning math that help us learn what is useful for active inference?
127200	145920	14	A	0.88853	Anyone can raise their hand or we can just start to add some annotations here, like what should be included in the primary regime of attention with a reading of a book, either linearly, like some books are, or in a maybe moving around the sections.
146500	148800	15	A	0.99746	So what should be in the chapters?
149880	151344	16	A	0.99994	What should be in the appendix?
151392	152900	17	A	0.99998	What is not in the appendix?
156690	160538	18	A	0.99992	What did people expect would be in the chapter in the appendix?
160634	161790	19	A	0.99998	Not covered.
186930	189280	20	A	0.9	Yeah, Jessica and then anyone else?
191650	197230	21	B	0.99	Yeah, I was wondering about the multiplication of the matrices that we covered yesterday.
197890	204430	22	B	0.99997	Which equations have the multiplication of the matrices?
205910	210420	23	B	0.96	A couple of examples just so I can play around with them.
213530	216790	24	B	0.97	In the actual active inference equations.
221270	223522	25	A	0.99777	Does anyone know?
223576	238482	26	A	1.0	One, this is referencing the way that the appendix A is starting with linear algebra and then introducing this operation of multiplying two matrices.
238546	248410	27	A	0.84	Or to get a product if someone can find like an equation that we already seen or some other equation while I'm typing up that question, that would be helpful.
315250	325902	28	A	0.98488	Could anyone just describe what they thought the intention was of starting with linear algebra and using 8.1 as the first equation of the appendix?
326046	329780	29	A	1.0	Or we'll return to just the more general questions.
339560	345780	30	C	0.4	Yeah, I mean, learning our algebra is kind of the most discreet.
348220	348648	31	A	0.97	I don't.
348654	362780	32	C	0.55363	Want to say fundamental, but like practical and comprehensive way of kind of working with a large space of data, I guess, together and computing on it.
362850	384280	33	C	0.99947	So it's kind of the basis for the discrete parts and maybe easier than the nondiscrete parts.
385180	386570	34	C	0.99938	Good reason it started.
397850	409290	35	D	0.78	I guess if the question was where is linear algebra used in the active inference math?
410910	413740	36	D	0.82766	When you go to appendix b.
414270	426282	37	D	0.87	Then you've got the equations of active inference and these are all expressed in terms of large vector spaces of variables, so probability of distributions.
426426	434658	38	D	1.0	And so for example, on page 245, you've got this dot notation which is the expectation of a value.
434824	445846	39	D	0.7527	So that goes directly back to that first section of appendix A is what does that mean in terms of how do you take an expectation of a large vector of things?
445948	447990	40	D	0.58092	How do you express that compactly?
450490	451240	41	A	0.54043	Thanks.
451690	464426	42	A	0.97642	Could you unpack we looked at the dot notation a little bit yesterday and they were mentioning how well, I think it was actually one of the questions too.
464448	467740	43	A	0.79862	Let's just see if someone asks this, okay?
468930	482366	44	A	0.99948	They say the dot operator in a three, the dot operator is equivalent to standard matrix multiplication where the first matrix has been transposed.
482558	485970	45	A	0.99936	So what is the relationship with expectation?
487910	493750	46	A	0.62952	How does expectation for anyone, how does expectation relate to linear algebra?
506160	513036	47	D	0.89	Yeah, expectation is the probability of a value, the average probability of some value.
513138	524736	48	D	0.99997	So you're going to take all the possible values and you're going to multiply them by the probability of that value and then divide by the sum of the probability of normal is to one.
524838	526572	49	D	0.99997	So that will be the expectation.
526716	545592	50	D	0.98549	So if you have a whole array or a vector in your distribution, you can express that all in compact notation by saying with this simple way of saying we're going to take every one of these terms and we're going to multiply it by the probability of that term and the probability is some to one.
545646	549400	51	D	0.99997	So then that will be your average overall.
551340	553550	52	A	0.99947	Awesome, thanks for that answer.
559200	561724	53	A	1.0	Okay, thanks for that awesome answer.
561922	567760	54	A	0.99997	Does anyone have any other thoughts on just this first question and then we'll continue.
567910	572400	55	A	0.99552	So what is figuring ground?
572900	575436	56	A	0.55455	We're learning active inference in the chapters.
575548	577152	57	A	0.99996	That's why the chapters are there.
577286	582404	58	A	1.0	The appendix is there to somehow lightly supplement that.
582602	591052	59	A	0.92	Like they describe it as an introduction or a refresher to the basic mathematical techniques.
591216	612380	60	A	0.85	And linear algebra is the first section, a two that is discussing a lot of important things like derivatives and Probabilities taylor series variational calculus and Stochastic dynamics are going to come in in the coming chapters, but the linear algebra is important for the upcoming chapters.
616580	621730	61	A	0.85	Okay, so this question asked in a three.
627460	639700	62	A	0.99864	They say the dot operator is equivalent to standard matrix multiplication where the first matrix has been transposed, which is flipped like it's the operation in Google Sheets or Excel right click paste transpose.
640200	645464	63	A	0.99999	They say that in the case of column matrices, this is equivalent to the dot product.
645662	654350	64	A	0.99975	So the dot operator here is like a generalization of the vector dot operator, the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.
655280	662600	65	A	0.99888	So the questions here were what is interpretation, implication or use of a dot product of vectors?
662760	667760	66	A	1.0	And then what is an interpretation, implication or use of a more generalized dot product.
667830	670290	67	A	1.0	And there looks like there's an awesome answer.
711750	719350	68	A	0.96147	What would be a situation where if anyone can think of one, like the Dot product would be applied.
721610	723640	69	A	0.9999	We're trying to do this in this situation.
724810	726940	70	A	0.99915	This is the operation that we needed.
727870	731740	71	A	0.9895	We wanted to compute matrix A on something of something.
732430	734780	72	A	0.99998	We used B dot C.
742990	780670	73	C	0.99809	Continue eric's description from the probability like you have expectation probability and you wanted to kind of see the error or whatever the difference, I guess between observation and the expectation, then a Dot product would give you that answer or it's a probability density of it.
787930	790550	74	A	0.99999	What are some ways to compute differences?
792010	803150	75	A	0.73	Like if there are scalars you can subtract like five minus three or something, then it was mentioned of cosine similarity.
803490	815730	76	A	0.93326	Does anyone think of or imagine another way that you could compute the difference between two different kinds of features of different dimensions.
823970	831950	77	A	0.93	Like another example is divergence because that's like measuring the differences between these two distributions and there's different divergences.
832030	833540	78	A	1.0	The KL is one of them.
834710	841190	79	A	0.99997	What other things are in this space that might be just tractable possible distance measures?
843850	848834	80	D	0.99869	Well, these are the same dimensionality in all these cases.
848882	855610	81	D	0.59443	But another very popular one is the sum squared difference, sum squared error.
856430	861114	82	D	0.56	And then you can have absolute different value difference.
861312	864190	83	D	0.99988	So these are called different norms.
865730	867280	84	D	0.71	I think that's the right word.
867730	868480	85	A	0.99981	Yes.
868850	878530	86	E	0.52476	There's also the Ginny index, the Jacard index, euclidean distances like sample to sample distances.
907910	915794	87	A	0.9798	So could anyone talk about L zero, l one and L two, et cetera norms?
915922	918150	88	A	0.99937	While I'm adding some links.
933520	939992	89	D	0.75781	If I have the right numbers here l two norm would be the square root of the sum of squares.
940056	948592	90	D	1.0	L one norm would be the average of the absolute absolute value differences and L zero.
948646	950370	91	D	0.97	I don't know what that is.
951700	953664	92	D	0.99	I don't think it's a difference, is it?
953862	955760	93	A	0.97394	It's like a presence absence.
956680	957430	94	D	1.0	Okay.
960520	971640	95	A	0.99934	That kind of encoding is used in a lot of different algorithms and then the L two norm is the sum of squares.
972140	985630	96	A	0.99856	So the L two norm is what is used like in at least squares regression, classical statistics, ttest inova that's a lot driven by the L two norm.
988880	996400	97	A	1.0	And all of that is like in the genre of what the A three notation is describing.
998820	1008310	98	A	0.9498	But depending on what the B and the C are and what the A is, et cetera, there's just the dimensions of everything and other operations that are happening before or after it.
1013190	1017506	99	D	0.99998	Later on they mentioned the quadratic, which is the L two norm.
1017608	1021922	100	D	0.99991	So that's where you have the same term as multiplied by itself.
1022056	1025510	101	D	1.0	Or if you have cross terms, then you get the covariance.
1028780	1036440	102	A	1.0	And that's going to be used later with the LaPlace approximation and other approximation techniques.
1039760	1043470	103	A	0.99962	Any other comments on a three or dot product?
1044320	1048780	104	A	1.0	Or just like this kind of linear algebra topic?
1061240	1083820	105	A	0.99973	Linear algebra the basics, the trace and the determinant, which are probably less important than the dot product but still come into play, the derivatives, how things change with respect to each other, possibly time, possibly some other surface, and then probabilities.
1088320	1092424	106	A	0.97572	So does anyone have any other comments or thoughts on that whole section?
1092472	1097170	107	A	0.9	Like anything that they read or like had uncertainty around up to equation A 22?
1109860	1110368	108	A	0.99983	Great.
1110454	1115010	109	A	0.64211	That no one has uncertainty around any of the equations up to A 22?
1118600	1125590	110	A	1.0	Yeah, obviously there is a lot to learn and to understand and we're not going to.
1128200	1130964	111	A	0.6464	It's just I don't know people who want to think about that.
1131002	1133288	112	A	0.73	Like, what are we learning in Appendix A?
1133454	1135210	113	A	0.99998	Why is appendix A there?
1137420	1141210	114	A	0.99868	Hopefully we can start to understand some of this in Math Learning Group.
1141740	1159170	115	A	1.0	The people who want to be really engaged with the math questioning and process and also connecting it to computer science into the applications has been happening and then hopefully everyone can benefit from this, like finding the resources and stuff.
1159780	1167440	116	A	0.99999	Because the relationships between the terms, relationships amongst the terms are driven by formalisms.
1169320	1178820	117	A	0.98	Like the way that preferences and expectations are framed in active inference is related to equations, not only a conceptual linkage.
1190120	1195800	118	A	0.99967	Maybe here we can just write Math Learning Group and copy this to the resources.
1199100	1208924	119	A	0.98	Okay, so what kinds of examples do you think would be useful for learning the equations and concepts in Appendix A?
1209122	1222640	120	A	0.95112	If the equations felt too general and not applying to anything in particular, what example or scenario or would have made sense or you felt would have made that clearer?
1227020	1232952	121	A	0.99	Like, we're running a business and first this person wants to do this and then this person wants to do that?
1233086	1240670	122	A	0.55	Or what example or what would somebody have expected to have found or wanted to have found that would have made it clear?
1242480	1251932	123	A	0.81352	Examples or other exercises or a format?
1251996	1253948	124	A	0.9996	This is kind of like a math lecture.
1254124	1261140	125	A	0.94992	It's kind of directional versus like, what other things could happen where you would feel like you were understanding and learning this and engaging with it.
1261210	1261492	126	A	0.66534	Yes.
1261546	1262464	127	A	0.99976	Thanks, Brock.
1262592	1281912	128	C	1.0	I was kind of reminded of a video that Karl A presentation where he in real time demonstrates and helps you work through a pattern of red.
1281966	1287336	129	C	0.76	Like it's like three dots sort of that are moving around red, green and pattern.
1287368	1321620	130	C	0.76	And so understanding just a simple visual example of how active inference would work that doesn't require the formalism to just surface level kind of pattern recognized, that would be like ideal maybe of then bringing in the math for this part and that part and some scaffolding.
1322460	1334064	131	C	0.96893	But yeah, I'm not sure the appendix, I'm not sure it was meant to be bred in.
1334262	1346950	132	C	0.54058	I'm not sure there's a great way to read one order or another there because you kind of need it, but you kind of it's a lot too, right?
1348200	1350392	133	A	0.86	Yeah, great point.
1350446	1360948	134	A	1.0	And the organizing team for the textbook group which was open to everybody who wanted to join the and the comms weekly meetings.
1361044	1371740	135	A	0.99999	So for future cohorts, people could totally be involved with planning it, communicating it, doing anything for future cohorts as a co organizer or other role.
1372240	1375330	136	A	0.93661	But we talked a lot about the reading order.
1376260	1387090	137	A	0.9983	Would it make sense to read them in without appendix or putting the appendix last or somewhere else?
1388920	1398070	138	A	0.99	One was short and hopefully the one week of regime of attention on appendix A and B is like we're just skimming it in a week.
1399160	1406024	139	A	0.99919	We're not getting a PhD in math, we're not generating these equations on a blank piece of paper.
1406222	1418124	140	A	0.98387	We're just like seeing the forms that will be used and then some of the key areas in the order that the authors thought that those background topics were important.
1418242	1436450	141	A	0.9972	So like for appendix A, linear algebra, which is what we talked the most about, because it's going to come into play most quickly, especially with these notions of expectation and differences which is going to come into play with everything that's going to happen.
1436920	1444772	142	A	0.68799	Taylor series variational calculus and Stochastic dynamics we talked less about.
1444906	1455160	143	A	0.99997	They happened in a later order within the appendix, but hopefully there will still be many questions on them because they're probably also areas with a lot to learn and to clarify.
1455660	1461784	144	A	0.86	And also appendix A is like not the final resource of it diffusing into us.
1461902	1465740	145	A	0.74	Like something that was really important that came up in the math learning group.
1465890	1489004	146	A	0.99994	Is there's not like a glossary of variables or table of variables so that's something we can work on with notation is connecting the variables to natural language ontology terms and then also things like this what do we even look up or a symbol or what does it mean when there's a double arrow?
1489132	1500150	147	A	0.9291	There's a lot of things that like a lot of dots that could be connected if people ask them and then we can probably get a response like what was the double arrow in a three?
1500860	1502964	148	A	0.99697	Does it mean anything that they're offset?
1503092	1509304	149	A	0.65	Or what are the parts of this shape that are mattering for the background of learning?
1509422	1512860	150	A	0.9995	Active inference, anyone can ask like any question.
1512930	1519576	151	A	0.99999	If it's coming to mind as an uncertainty, then writing it down just anywhere is really helpful.
1519768	1539060	152	A	1.0	Because then on the first pass through learning or a primary branch of learning, we can just go, okay, here's what a one shows, and then have that in a way that reduces uncertainty more rapidly than how any of us would just give an ad hoc explanation.
1545160	1564744	153	D	0.70304	Moritz wrote one thing that I always find useful in thinking about matrix, linear algebra matrices is to write out pictures of the matrices in their dimensions because often the notation, you've got these I's and J's and K's and stuff going around, but you don't know how that maps out into the actual elements of the matrix.
1564792	1571788	154	D	0.9662	So those illustrations are always helpful that could be added into this book.
1571874	1573950	155	D	0.88772	They're in a few places, but not that much.
1574880	1575804	156	D	0.79396	There you go.
1575922	1576990	157	D	0.99999	Things like that.
1579120	1579640	158	A	0.82	Yeah.
1579730	1594004	159	A	0.79	And also connecting the programming experience that people might have even in no code tools like Excel Google Sheet, you have rows and columns, ones have numbers and ones have letters, but they can be other things.
1594202	1612408	160	A	1.0	And then anyone who's used something like Python or R or even just doing some statistical calculations, like if you put two lists of numbers into the t test, that would be vector versus vector something, and then you would address the fifth element of the list.
1612574	1618264	161	A	0.97	And then if it was in Excel, you would need to address two numbers to say where you were in the matrix.
1618312	1626416	162	A	0.99	And then the tensor is just any number of more than three dimensions, which is sometimes like it's like, oh, but how spatially are we going to see it?
1626438	1639430	163	A	0.55319	But then we're familiar with working with spreadsheets and data sets that are larger than two by two or larger than two dimensions, and that will come into play a lot.
1640280	1644580	164	A	1.0	And the numbers can be representing probabilities or be used for probabilities.
1646840	1657412	165	E	0.71	I also Daniel in the chat shared a link to a Python notebook that is a link, and it shows kind of the operations on matrices.
1657476	1663496	166	E	0.58	And you can see both the mathematical yeah, there you go.
1663678	1667372	167	E	0.62259	So you can see the actual matrix and you can actually run code too, there.
1667426	1670350	168	E	0.57623	So that particular awesome.
1670800	1677680	169	A	0.99308	So I pasted the link in here and then we can fill out the rest of the row.
1679060	1693520	170	A	0.99989	But then someone could be looking for a guide on matrix or programming and matrix or something before this state.
1694210	1699760	171	A	0.99867	So then each person, if they find it and add it here, will have a lot to share and learn.
1705340	1725860	172	A	1.0	Okay, does anybody want to like, if they were the one who asked it this question, I i think it's probably referring to long equations that that probably none of us are ready to give answers to at this point.
1727270	1730980	173	A	0.82706	Unless somebody wants to contextualize this question.
1738320	1741072	174	A	0.99954	I'm hoping a read of chapter four will elucidate when the time comes.
1741126	1743170	175	A	0.99996	Just exploring the formal foundations here.
1745140	1745890	176	A	1.0	Okay.
1751470	1752220	177	A	0.75	Okay.
1756370	1765630	178	A	0.99084	Does anyone have a favorite or recommended textbook that it contains the KL divergence and Dearsley distribution in the index.
1768230	1769762	179	A	0.91382	This is for the math learning group.
1769816	1770034	180	A	1.0	Okay.
1770072	1774340	181	A	0.99979	Maybe we could tag some questions too, and so then we can know which ones they can look at.
1775350	1776900	182	A	0.96033	Wikipedia is good.
1778230	1780094	183	A	0.96	The Kale divergence is approachable.
1780142	1781750	184	A	1.0	The deerish lay is tougher.
1782730	1786280	185	A	1.0	The links take you to definitions that enable you to put the pieces together.
1788490	1796902	186	A	0.99	Okay, any comments on KL and Dear schley from someone who is familiar?
1796966	1801500	187	A	0.86778	Otherwise it sounds very technical and we don't need to go into it right now.
1816590	1820700	188	A	0.97989	What is up with dividing by sigma in a 31?
1824390	1847580	189	A	0.999	Also detail, but we'll just see if there's any questions that are not going to be specific details because math is very hard to understand sometimes on the fly and there's definitely a space for the interactive discussions around math that are unrecorded which are important.
1848350	1867150	190	A	0.99999	However, this is a little bit of a different format, which is how I'm hopefully interpreting people's activity rather than their disengagements because they are here and hopefully have at least scanned these chapters.
1875910	1880820	191	A	0.9904	Anyone can raise their hand at any time or add questions or upload things.
1882390	1902540	192	A	0.76	Mean field mode, equation nine, equation 16 probability resource, statistical question, appendix B just to see if there was any.
1904270	1906410	193	A	0.99993	Also seem like all details.
1906990	1909918	194	A	0.99895	So we have 23 minutes.
1910084	1914560	195	A	0.9992	What does anybody want to ask now?
1915010	1928580	196	A	1.0	Or is there some question here like the most upvoted one or some other one that's far less challenging that they would like to address for the next 20 minutes?
1970350	1974410	197	A	0.99991	Did anyone read Appendix A or B visually?
1982990	1985182	198	E	0.99984	Did you just ask if anyone read it?
1985316	1985662	199	A	0.99997	Yes.
1985716	1988240	200	A	0.99996	What would anyone like to share about reading it?
1989650	1997620	201	E	0.99	I totally read it with a highlighter and made several notes in the margin in my physical book.
1998070	1999278	202	E	0.73832	It was challenging.
1999374	2014038	203	E	1.0	A lot of the notation I feel like is crazy, even just independence b was it the very first thing?
2014204	2019330	204	E	1.0	Are they using O for observations or are they using O for outcomes?
2019410	2022540	205	E	0.58	I was totally unclear on that.
2023070	2023820	206	F	0.99998	Completely.
2024270	2033660	207	E	0.95698	So like state inference, Markov decision processes like the states that influence outcomes O, right?
2034030	2034534	208	E	0.99963	Literally.
2034582	2036960	209	E	0.99997	That's what it says on the top of page 244.
2037650	2040510	210	E	0.99729	So it says that the variable O is an outcome.
2040850	2042442	211	E	0.92008	Is an outcome and observation.
2042506	2043454	212	E	0.99987	Are those the same thing?
2043492	2044910	213	E	0.99999	Are they interchangeable?
2045410	2047550	214	E	0.96947	I've always thought O was observations.
2048210	2051002	215	E	1.0	I put that question in there in the past.
2051156	2056802	216	E	0.79548	It's already there and then the question right before it.
2056856	2059374	217	E	0.99998	This is a really tricky section.
2059422	2059874	218	E	0.80228	Right?
2059992	2067970	219	E	0.56429	So the two questions that are in Appendix B that are together, it says the likelihood of observations given a policy is not straightforward to compute.
2068050	2080646	220	E	0.99998	This is because POMDP problem is structured so that policies pi influence trajectories indicated by tilde of states S that influence outcomes o without a direct influence of policies on outcomes.
2080838	2089850	221	E	1.0	The problem then involves the sum over trajectories of states to marginalize these out and find a marginal likelihood of observations given policies.
2089930	2091918	222	E	0.57	Like what does that these even refer to?
2092004	2096990	223	E	1.0	If you look in the questions in Appendix B, they're there in the questions already listed.
2098050	2101470	224	E	1.0	I felt like it was very obscure and not super clear.
2101540	2112514	225	E	0.65	And also the notation gets crazy and I'm really a stickler for defining every single variable and symbol in an equation to understand the math so that I can actually read it in English.
2112642	2115270	226	E	0.91	So I was a little bit lost.
2117690	2118998	227	A	0.98444	Totally agree.
2119164	2121554	228	A	0.80992	Thanks for sharing it, Eric.
2121602	2134666	229	D	0.99663	Just with respect to that particular question, I think that these refers to the trajectories of states and you can see that because the sum is over the tilde s.
2134848	2138000	230	D	0.9678	So the tilde s is the trajectories of states.
2139570	2147280	231	D	0.9999	So you sum over all the trajectories of states to try to figure out, well, what are we going to get if we apply a given policy?
2148390	2150180	232	D	0.98588	That's my intuition about that.
2150710	2154526	233	A	0.93	And I suspect also that observations are outcomes.
2154558	2156094	234	A	0.98662	They're sensory outcomes.
2156142	2163510	235	A	0.99249	They're the outcome of a generative model or a generative process, but they're the outcome that is observed.
2168090	2175210	236	A	0.99977	How many dots we need to actually unpack and connect for unsighted grammatically vague sentences.
2175550	2176106	237	E	0.99994	Right.
2176208	2176954	238	E	0.80323	So thank you.
2176992	2181930	239	E	0.99999	My uncertainty has been reduced substantially just by figuring that out.
2182000	2187280	240	E	1.0	But I felt like that the whole time I was reading the appendix, I was like, what is even going on here?
2188690	2189440	241	A	0.99	Yeah.
2192290	2194842	242	D	0.489	Sir, the way I view it is like exercising.
2194986	2207074	243	D	0.93628	You're not going to run a marathon the first time you set out, but the more you stretch and warm up and I think that's how I kind of view this.
2207192	2212290	244	D	0.99998	Going through the appendix is kind of refreshing on what you used to know about math, at least for me.
2212440	2216342	245	D	0.84	And so that's like stretching and doing a little bit of exercise last week.
2216476	2223442	246	D	1.0	And then every time you go through it, every time you see the notation, you've slept on it some more, it becomes more and more familiar.
2223506	2226294	247	D	1.0	And so you can start to put together bigger, bigger chunks.
2226422	2230742	248	D	0.99995	Some vaguely you can map to the notation and the math.
2230806	2237578	249	D	0.99987	Other ones it's still going to be dangling, but that's okay because there's fewer dangling things that you're groping with at any given moment.
2237664	2245134	250	D	0.99966	So I think it's great to go through these dependencies and see it all through one pass and all right, so I didn't run a marathon, but that's okay.
2245172	2245994	251	D	1.0	I ran 2 miles.
2246042	2248020	252	D	0.99813	That's pretty good for first start.
2249430	2250670	253	A	0.58833	Thanks, Eric.
2250830	2253570	254	A	0.99998	Another metaphor is just like, oh, yes, please.
2253640	2254530	255	A	0.54703	Jakub.
2256470	2273274	256	G	1.0	Yeah, I was just going to comment on what Blue said with some confusion about the notation because I asked the question about the marginalizing of state.
2273312	2285686	257	G	0.99999	But then I was also confused about the O notation because in equation B one, it seems that it's a trajectory over outcomes.
2285798	2289230	258	G	0.99999	But then there's also an O without a tilde on it.
2289380	2292974	259	G	0.9984	So does that mean that it's an outcome at a particular point in time?
2293012	2298622	260	G	0.99991	But then there's also a bold o, which implies that it's kind of a vector.
2298686	2303038	261	G	0.99031	But if it's a trajectory of outcomes, that also seems to be a vector.
2303134	2311400	262	G	0.58	Like a trajectory for me implies some kind of vector form because it's a sequence of outcomes given a policy.
2312010	2319154	263	G	0.99998	But then what does that bold O mean if not trajectories over outcomes?
2319282	2325080	264	G	0.92911	So just to kind of add to the confusion, I guess.
2326170	2327170	265	E	0.99967	Thanks, Jacob.
2327250	2331660	266	E	0.99934	I'm glad we're groking we're on the same page, you and I for sure.
2334690	2338750	267	A	0.99951	It would be awesome for description or any notes.
2339170	2343390	268	A	0.78033	What is the reading or a reading in language?
2344850	2352226	269	A	0.94	The this of this conditioned on that is this over that of these two things.
2352328	2353282	270	A	1.0	The first thing is this.
2353336	2367640	271	A	1.0	The second one is that an example of that is in this situation, here's the script, here's the graphical abstract, here's the paper, here's the person you could ask, which one of these do you think is going to be interesting?
2373790	2378890	272	A	0.71	Okay, so Mike asked, and I'll copy this in for those who have read the entire book.
2378960	2382970	273	A	0.99991	Did you find the appendices useful as you went along through the chapters?
2398940	2399880	274	A	0.91861	Ali.
2404300	2404712	275	F	0.99	Yeah.
2404766	2424620	276	F	1.0	I also think that if the materials in these two appendices were to be integrated in the linear narrative of the whole book, it would be much more useful than separating out as separate appendices.
2424700	2425330	277	A	0.96723	Because.
2427700	2430864	278	F	0.99321	As we see, that's my own experience.
2431062	2451320	279	F	0.99025	Well, reading the chapters independently and in isolation of the narrative doesn't give me a sense of their concrete applications and I don't know how to use them and how to use all of these equations, and everything becomes much more fuzzy.
2461800	2463472	280	A	1.0	I hope this is not controversial.
2463536	2485004	281	A	0.99995	That linear reading of the appendix as something that you look through is extremely confusing or extremely imprecise because there's many symbols introduced that might have been introduced earlier, like O is probably discussed earlier, but then it's briefly just sort of mentioned.
2485122	2488124	282	A	0.92	And then there's a lot of symbology that's not mentioned.
2488242	2489310	283	A	0.99999	What it is.
2490100	2493040	284	A	0.98834	So it's hard to read the appendix without prior knowledge.
2494260	2500720	285	A	0.72175	Yet, ostensibly, Appendix A is the introduction refresher.
2505020	2508280	286	A	0.96964	So is this the introduction offering?
2509900	2511096	287	A	0.6772	They hope so.
2511118	2524780	288	A	0.99993	They expect and prefer perhaps the appendix to go some way towards remedying it being the maths required to understand this not complicated basis.
2527550	2537280	289	A	1.0	The multidisciplinary basis means it is often difficult to find resources that bring together the necessary prerequisites they're going some way.
2537810	2543102	290	A	0.99655	So this is like one kind of plank out there from their point of view, from the chapters.
2543246	2544210	291	A	0.99106	This is stuff.
2544360	2548820	292	A	0.44293	Ali I also kind of agree on what ordering these are really interesting questions.
2549270	2556770	293	A	0.87643	So then what is the next connector that picks up here with this artifact?
2558550	2573850	294	A	0.55109	Because someone mentioned how Moritz mentioned you could basically do a whole course on deep learning to apply most of the matrix operations and whole courses on the math of them so they can't go into all this detail.
2573920	2580220	295	A	0.99998	They can't spend 1 hour or like multiple coda pages on just what this means.
2581250	2592750	296	A	0.99743	So there has to be some kind of compromise, but then there's not going to be one specific perfect compromise, especially with like, length and audience considered.
2596390	2604242	297	E	0.69	I undertook a very detailed linear reading of the book because that's just kind of how I am, of the appendixes at least.
2604376	2612710	298	E	0.99999	But I think for many people that I've been there before, where you're staring at math equations like this is gibberish.
2613770	2619162	299	E	0.73951	Just to read the text and to read it and go through it, it's helpful to know that it's there.
2619296	2631014	300	E	0.99982	So if nothing else, at least you can be reading the book and then be like, oh, I remember kind of reading about Taylor series expansion in the appendix.
2631142	2639466	301	E	0.52	And so then you can just go back and just having access to it or the refresh recall access, even though it is confusing.
2639498	2642830	302	E	1.0	I agree to try to a linear read of the appendix.
2644310	2650370	303	E	1.0	I think skimming over it or deeply reading it and then being able to refer back to it is useful.
2651270	2652530	304	A	0.75493	Thanks, Blue.
2653670	2658934	305	A	0.99202	So in next week, we're going next two weeks.
2659052	2667510	306	A	0.99664	So the pace of one section per week might be like whatever it was for you, however much time you put in, et cetera.
2668090	2676614	307	A	1.0	The coming chapters are going to be very different because one didn't have any formalisms or figures really, just the kind of overview figures.
2676742	2678906	308	A	0.99991	But we're going to have two weeks for two.
2679088	2681514	309	A	0.63916	So no need to rush it.
2681552	2685898	310	A	0.99999	Read a couple of pages and then just go back to the beginning and just restart the same pages.
2686074	2689162	311	A	0.99537	That's like the multiple coats of paint in a mural.
2689306	2691546	312	A	1.0	Like the low road to active inference.
2691738	2699458	313	A	0.49412	That's where they're going to pick up in that high road, low road dialectic that we talked about last time.
2699624	2702402	314	A	0.64256	Let's just see what figures, what equations might happen.
2702456	2702770	315	A	1.0	Okay.
2702840	2709062	316	A	0.75896	Lot of terms that hopefully are in the ontology already.
2709196	2721158	317	A	0.86	Like you can use the at symbol hopefully to call most of them, but if something's not there, we can add it to supplemental or entailed.
2721334	2727180	318	A	0.64	Okay, so what figures and figures and equations will we might see?
2727550	2732590	319	A	0.99983	Here's a box 2.1 about probability.
2734770	2750290	320	A	0.65547	Here's an equation that's the Bayesian kernel and it's going to be talking about this example of a frog and an apple and jumping or not jumping.
2750630	2754558	321	A	1.0	And that example is going to play a current role.
2754654	2761590	322	A	0.99995	But then some likelihoods are shown in a specific example of like frogs and jumping or not and apples.
2763210	2768330	323	A	0.99899	There's a work through example of exact Bayesian inference.
2770750	2773770	324	A	0.93433	Here's a table on statistical distributions.
2776350	2783138	325	A	0.87722	It would be really interesting, like to hear what support and surprise mean and what are these district?
2783174	2784426	326	A	0.99518	Are these all the distributions?
2784458	2785518	327	A	0.99999	Are there other ones?
2785604	2786782	328	A	1.0	Or like why these ones?
2786836	2788346	329	A	0.96	Or why are they useful?
2788538	2789838	330	A	0.99995	Where have they been used?
2789924	2791280	331	A	0.75478	What does it even mean?
2794550	2802894	332	A	0.99452	Here's where the KL divergence is introduced and then some more analysis from a surprise perspective.
2802942	2806230	333	A	0.45235	Bayesian surprise with the KL divergence.
2807290	2812502	334	A	0.98228	There's the box on expectations, which is also what we talked about a little bit today.
2812556	2816310	335	A	1.0	And that was really interesting to connect it to the matrices.
2819930	2845390	336	A	0.98	A figure of the generative process and the generative model is the caption a figure both perception and action minimize discrepancy between model and world free energy.
2850200	2857556	337	A	0.91398	Variational free energy as an upper bound on negative log evidence the figure but with equations in it.
2857738	2868010	338	A	0.99996	Very common format figure complementary roles of perception and action in the minimization of variational free energy.
2869100	2875804	339	A	0.92159	Big act, imp theme and like something kind of a common fristinism like perception and.
2875842	2881870	340	A	0.99988	Action, being in the same game or being in the same service of the same objective function.
2886180	2892400	341	A	0.99985	Planning but no specific equations but probably citations.
2894820	2902870	342	A	0.99996	Just introducing expected free energy, which Yaakob and others can probably go into a lot more detail on.
2903960	2909430	343	A	0.99999	Expected free energy about a future where the outcomes haven't happened.
2911740	2917130	344	A	0.99937	Expected free energy figure with equations, the end of the low road.
2917500	2937090	345	A	0.66543	Introducing the two key terms variational free energy, expected free energy summary does anybody, like, want to, like, add or what was something cool or whether they read it already or not?
2951280	2952536	346	A	0.82048	What does anyone Ali?
2952568	2953390	347	A	0.99889	Yes, please.
2958180	2965600	348	F	0.99839	Well, I've noticed the dispersion of some sidebar boxes like box 2.1 or in this chapter.
2967700	2979780	349	F	0.52	I don't know the distinction between the purpose of these boxes and I mean, what's the function of these boxes as compared to what we see in the appendices?
2981100	2990772	350	F	0.99967	Because presumably these boxes cover the concepts that could be skipped over if one is familiar with these mathematical concepts.
2990836	2998136	351	F	0.81964	So do you have any idea about the reason behind this decision?
2998248	3008480	352	F	0.93	I mean, covering some basic concepts, basic mathematical concepts in these sidebar boxes and some others in the appendices?
3018910	3020380	353	A	0.97395	That's a great question.
3021230	3025350	354	A	1.0	A box could reflect like, okay, expectations.
3025430	3025786	355	A	0.99999	Got it.
3025808	3027606	356	A	1.0	Or like, okay, some product rule.
3027638	3028310	357	A	0.92	All right.
3028480	3031150	358	A	0.99997	But it's kind of like you might want to read that.
3031220	3034622	359	A	1.0	Or is this introductory highlighting it?
3034756	3037470	360	A	0.99997	This is the 101 on probability.
3038050	3040846	361	A	1.0	Or is it saying this is a total skippable unit?
3040878	3044900	362	A	0.99999	If you want to learn about how the lizard does it, here's where you look.
3045510	3047682	363	A	0.89882	It can sometimes mean both.
3047736	3056790	364	A	0.88	And the format of the book is also relatively austere, though in a concise tone.
3059770	3076518	365	A	0.95865	It's in black and white, which especially in some later sections make some visualizations where it's like it's hard to understand what curves are doing what it's a black and white image, so what is there to see with the color?
3076704	3086430	366	A	0.91867	But it also might predispose towards more simple or visually accessible material.
3087330	3091678	367	A	0.99986	So what is going to be accessible and the order.
3091764	3093700	368	A	0.99994	So those are all really important questions.
3094550	3101582	369	A	0.99993	So we can just take notes on it in the weeks that we're going to continue to do this because we only have limited live time.
3101736	3103190	370	A	0.99944	How about in the last like 3 minutes?
3103260	3109750	371	A	0.99995	What does anybody think about the opening quotations or specifically this quotation?
3111850	3116422	372	A	0.99998	My thinking is first and last and always for the sake of my doing.
3116556	3117750	373	A	0.99983	William James.
3123060	3127250	374	D	1.0	I thought the guy was a philosopher, so I guess you just abused me of that one.
3129490	3130240	375	B	0.38	I.
3137210	3149340	376	A	0.84	Yeah, these would be really nice areas to look into for people who like the history part.
3150350	3160240	377	A	0.99683	Blue and I and others are working on some different kinds of ways to reference papers and just up cool paper.
3161010	3162762	378	A	0.98423	Sensation perception.
3162906	3164142	379	A	0.99997	We have those terms.
3164276	3166830	380	A	0.9999	We could just link the paper somewhere.
3167490	3179442	381	A	0.54565	So if anyone's like, interested in that kind of architectures or that kind of philosophy question the literature right now.
3179496	3188070	382	A	0.99999	Is small enough to know what has and hasn't been done in a lot of areas that are philosophical and applied and technical.
3193830	3197720	383	A	1.0	But just from, like, the first principles, what does this seem to mean.
3200330	3212394	384	C	0.98849	That shared that other group that we're kind of both a part of Daniel Liminal dow thing.
3212432	3213446	385	C	0.50001	That's not really a dow.
3213478	3233310	386	C	1.0	I don't know what it is, but there's this debate for some reason that's going on there about different ways of knowing and being and doing and a bunch of stuff that is kind of a mix of philosophy and linguistic fallacies.
3233390	3249240	387	C	0.99418	But if thinking is actually a physical process, which I think anyone here is going to argue against, then it is something necessarily that is being done.
3252410	3256062	388	C	0.8131	However, I guess, small, you want to draw that Markov blanket.
3256146	3268700	389	C	0.98	And then however large, whether that's your physical body actions or some extended thinking, it's literally what you're doing.
3272930	3278030	390	C	0.9952	It's not just for the sake of your actions, but they are your actions.
3279250	3282290	391	C	0.83535	They're just another set of your actions.
3283670	3284450	392	D	0.98	All right.
3284600	3286754	393	D	0.99907	I'll offer a different take on it.
3286952	3287314	394	A	0.92	Yeah.
3287352	3287986	395	D	0.99847	Awesome.
3288168	3307574	396	D	0.99727	William James was a great visionary, and he foresaw Mark's Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse 120 years ago or whatever, and he said, no, I don't want to live just inside my mind, inside the metaverse.
3307702	3311610	397	D	1.0	I want to be out in the world, interact with real people and real things.
3311680	3317500	398	D	0.99972	So he was a meta or Facebook skeptic way before his time.
3321010	3321470	399	A	1.0	Okay.
3321540	3322750	400	A	0.99993	Thank you, Ali.
3325970	3326334	401	A	0.95	Yeah.
3326372	3341166	402	F	0.99817	As Brock mentioned, I think it relates to an epistemological distinction between propositional knowledge and how to knowledge.
3341278	3354274	403	F	1.0	And I think this statement by this statement here tries to blur this distinction, blurs the line between propositional knowledge and know how knowledge.
3354322	3386580	404	F	0.99995	Because especially in analytical school of philosophy, there's always been a very, let's say not a heated debate, but there's a long standing debate about the distinction between these two kinds of knowledge and whether in fact they can be distinguished from each other or not.
3388790	3389442	405	A	0.99997	Thank you.
3389496	3397000	406	A	0.99998	Could you just unpack what are the two kinds of knowledge again, and what are just they referring to?
3397530	3398326	407	F	0.99992	Sure.
3398508	3411130	408	F	0.99952	Well, about propositional knowledge well, an example of propositional knowledge is to know the exact mechanisms of walking.
3411550	3419370	409	F	0.58	I mean, which muscles contract and which I mean, in what angles.
3422930	3434782	410	F	1.0	The whole thing about the biomechanics of walking, the whole knowledge about the biomechanics of knowledge can constitute this kind of propositional knowledge.
3434926	3439060	411	F	1.0	And it's totally different from knowing how to walk.
3439670	3454498	412	F	0.78	I mean, a three or four year old year old child has a know how knowledge of walking, but not necessarily where he or she doesn't know anything about the biomechanics of walking.
3454594	3459210	413	F	0.99977	So the biomechanics of walking is the propositional knowledge.
3459710	3466010	414	F	0.6102	Actually, knowing how to walk constitutes the know how of walking.
3474340	3493220	415	A	0.62514	So when people say things like active inference is integrating perception, cognition, and action, maybe it is rethinking some of these long held mental frameworks for distinguishing or operating differently on action and perception.
3494920	3504276	416	A	0.98	Like, one fascinating recent example from me and working with Eric was in the area of ant pheromone modeling.
3504308	3515404	417	A	0.99999	Without going into too many details, people often modeled preference as a function of the absolute amount of pheromone on trails because that's what the exponential, like, decay is on.
3515442	3523964	418	A	0.9998	That's what can be manipulated rather than the perceived intensity, which might have a different scaling relationship.
3524082	3526544	419	A	0.63015	So it's like a dim room, you can detect a small change.
3526582	3529136	420	A	0.93666	Bright room, you can't detect a small change.
3529318	3544740	421	A	0.99988	So that kind of psychophysics of perception gets ignored implicitly because of calls for measurability, because the cognitive can't be measured directly.
3545480	3555272	422	A	0.99943	Even if you potentially had an electrical measurement or something like that happening, then these are awesome questions.
3555326	3557960	423	A	0.72627	Can you think without acting or is thinking in action?
3564880	3575040	424	A	0.93667	This active paper, which was on a live stream, so we can provide the link to it.
3575110	3584050	425	A	0.99998	Models like perception and action in the sort of like kernel level, just the autonomous sensing sentient bot level.
3584660	3601400	426	A	0.91	And then attention and metacognition are both related as actions to the lower level, which is like why the paper is relating computational phenomenology with mental action.
3603260	3608570	427	A	0.67371	Again, just to have a look at the kinds of models that can happen.
3609100	3616460	428	A	0.98	And then now does making any model, fitting any data well enough and saying, well, we modeled it as action.
3616800	3618540	429	A	0.99992	So is thinking in action?
3619440	3626556	430	A	0.99961	Will that model that says, yeah, it's consistent with that, will that ever constitute positive evidence for saying thinking is action?
3626748	3630064	431	A	0.98	Or why even say that?
3630182	3632050	432	A	0.79	Or what does it mean to say it?
3634580	3636400	433	A	0.99	And then here's a funny meme.
3638360	3644916	434	A	0.88876	Here's the generative model and the generative the partially observable Markov decision process.
3645098	3654070	435	A	0.54908	Here's Karl, Friston, Jessica and then anyone else.
3656600	3657350	436	B	0.99753	Yes.
3658440	3662330	437	B	0.54	I guess it's like a beginning understanding of this.
3663740	3670168	438	B	0.95	I tend to think that there's like a bias towards action in active inference.
3670264	3681010	439	B	0.64	I think the first chapter is saying even if you want to sense or perceive, you have to do some kind of action in order to gain the information.
3682420	3699744	440	B	0.62	And this quote is basically saying like, okay, even though the whole field is trying to understand cognition, what we decide to do and the thinking that we go through in order to determine our policy is to determine our actions.
3699792	3703368	441	B	1.0	And then it sort of feed into the thinking itself.
3703454	3712250	442	B	0.99448	So maybe that's why there's like the bias to action because our actions is what it's going to be allowing the thinking.
3712940	3723452	443	B	0.99026	But when we update our models or trying to come up with the policies that we're going to be doing, like, we have to be processing things.
3723586	3728620	444	B	0.62582	So the thinking is in as a service to action.
3729920	3731404	445	B	0.7499	That's sort of like what I was thinking.
3731442	3737744	446	B	0.88	I don't know, it's a little bit like the chicken and the egg, but I kind of tend to think of it.
3737782	3748340	447	B	0.42001	It's like, yes, we have to act in order to understand, but the understanding which will be coming from the thinking is what determines our next action.
3749560	3751590	448	B	0.82	Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.
3756260	3757036	449	A	0.71791	Matthew.
3757148	3758320	450	A	0.99979	Thanks, Jessica.
3760740	3776240	451	H	0.8	Yeah, it kind of seems to me like we're stuck in a little bit of a linguistic Godellian loop of some sort because thinking is essentially a verb and verbs tend to imply, in a linguistic emergent term, actions.
3776400	3784724	452	H	0.98	And so we have to then pop outside of that and try to consider with our internal mental processes how to disentangle these concepts.
3784852	3800264	453	H	0.99996	But I see no reason to think, ironically, that internal mental states aren't also conscious parameterizations of processes in the brain and our ability to grasp control of that to some extent.
3800392	3811888	454	H	1.0	And so it seems very strange to me to try to separate those linguistically from our current vantage point, even though I understand why, historically, working only with language, it might have made sense.
3812054	3827510	455	H	0.52179	So those kind of quotes like James strike me as somewhat antiquated or just operating on dichotomies that don't seem to make sense given that we've unpacked these processes to the degree we have.
3830520	3831444	456	A	0.99983	Thank you, Matthew.
3831492	3833770	457	A	0.98213	Very deep points.
3834860	3838360	458	A	0.99	Like you mentioned, thinking as a verb implies action.
3839100	3847884	459	A	1.0	And then just to kind of complete that thought is like the word for the noun form of this one.
3848082	3849900	460	A	0.99944	So then what does that imply?
3856900	3861376	461	A	0.55	And then also, like Jessica mentioned, to.
3861398	3867404	462	H	0.99479	Some extent that we can only express processes through their discretization via symbols.
3867452	3868050	463	A	0.98164	Right.
3869300	3879108	464	H	1.0	The idea that there's this process, there's a flow, there's something that can't necessarily be separated, obviously, from the rest of the flows around it.
3879194	3892890	465	H	1.0	But to reference it, to point to it, to describe it, communicate it to another agent, we have to nounize it kind of like which is the opposite of verbalizing, so to speak.
3895440	3895948	466	A	0.99363	Wow.
3896034	3897340	467	A	0.99957	Thank you, Matthew.
3899760	3900172	468	A	0.99981	Again.
3900226	3900972	469	A	0.97418	These are yes.
3901026	3901740	470	A	0.99981	Eric.
3910030	3911162	471	D	0.99997	Sorry, I didn't have anything.
3911216	3913646	472	A	0.91	I didn't have the hand was yeah.
3913748	3921920	473	A	0.95719	So Karl Friston had an influential 2019 paper.
3922610	3923680	474	A	0.89868	Long paper.
3924050	3927550	475	A	0.75	The free energy principle for a particular physics.
3927710	3929566	476	A	0.65051	That was in 2019.
3929678	3932242	477	A	0.63395	So it's been several years since then.
3932376	3938770	478	A	0.84	And like, particular allegedly accidentally or intentionally is a pun.
3938930	3945090	479	A	0.99988	So it can mean specific, like a physics for the specific systems that we're modeling.
3945250	3948630	480	A	0.78	Or it could be specific, like this is a specific approach.
3949870	3971994	481	A	0.99954	Another interpretation is like it's for particulate entities when we define thing and the partition, which is going to coinstantiate, like the generative model and the generative process and then the Markov blanket or the interface that's separating them, that is separating the figure from ground.
3972042	3974950	482	A	0.99919	It's separating, like, the entity from the niche.
3975130	3977540	483	A	0.82138	It's separating what from what?
3978790	3980334	484	A	0.63759	What can it represent?
3980382	3987570	485	A	1.0	The separation of something from all possible separations, some separations.
3988890	3998280	486	A	0.99	And then, Matthew, you mentioned, like yeah, verbalizing speech, but it feels like we're speaking nouns sometimes.
3999290	4003846	487	A	0.50338	Yet verbalization is a process, especially dialogue.
4003878	4004122	488	A	1.0	Yes.
4004176	4004970	489	A	0.99947	Matthew.
4007630	4014460	490	H	0.69786	Could I ask a question that brings in a little bit of content from the other chapters of the book is that yeah, sure.
4014910	4023754	491	H	0.84623	I'm just kind of curious because when you're talking about those, you're talking about the Markov blankets and integrating it into this idea of how we draw boundaries.
4023882	4025298	492	H	0.99477	I'm kind of curious.
4025464	4044374	493	H	0.99999	Is it fair to say that to the extent we've drawn our boundaries and do see a reduction of free energy in this system, it reinforces the idea that there's something to that boundary structure as an entity in the world, that there's a reality to that?
4044412	4045990	494	H	0.99999	Is that a fair interpretation?
4050440	4053560	495	A	0.54	I think many people would have a lot to say and add.
4053630	4074430	496	A	0.99993	This touches on the question of reification of scientific models and the ability for identified statistical model to be like transcending itself and used in a realist way, like ontologically real about true joints of the world.
4074800	4084720	497	A	1.0	And I'm going to go to live stream table and find several of those who explained their research on this topic.
4085860	4104808	498	H	0.53993	But even short of trying to claim it's real, does that ability like once we've drawn a boundary using these Markov blankets and we do see that it seems to be, let's say, using information to self evidence, do we?
4104814	4105784	499	H	0.9999	Think that that's I mean, it seems.
4105822	4106410	500	A	1.0	Like.
4108700	4120380	501	H	0.99986	This paradigm of thought is predicated on the idea that to the extent that that occurs and reduces free energy, it should attract, or further attract attention, at the very least, for examination or investigation.
4122720	4123180	502	A	0.71344	Yes.
4123250	4125416	503	A	0.5833	So, great questions, Jacob.
4125448	4129010	504	A	1.0	Do you have something to add on that or is it a slightly different area?
4130420	4134640	505	G	1.0	I guess it's kind of related to the Markov blanket discussion.
4137540	4150756	506	G	0.99992	This may be completely wrong, but it seems to me like with that, this kind of discretization of the Markov blankets forces us to a specific kind of discrete thinking.
4150938	4157092	507	G	0.51685	But I feel like that just this model of a Markov blanket.
4157236	4174190	508	G	1.0	I think of it as a kind of classical model, but I presume that the reality is more something like a schrodinger Markov blanket where we can't really draw boundaries between thinking and observing a generative process.
4174880	4193060	509	G	1.0	In the same way that we can think of, say, electrons as balls bouncing off each other, but we can think of them as classical particles and that will help us to an extent, but then we can also observe the process of thinking.
4193130	4198550	510	G	0.99991	So thinking is also kind of entangled with the generative process.
4200520	4216088	511	G	0.71557	So even though the Markov blanket is a useful formalism, I think that there are definitely certain scenarios that in which it's more like a probabilistic.
4216264	4243590	512	G	0.62975	Well, it's already probabilistic, but in the sense that the entity that's performing inference also in its own inference loop performs inference on itself and therefore thinking is at the same time an action, but at the same time it's part of the generative process.
4250850	4260382	513	A	0.99981	Another angle on this thanks Jacob, is what Dean T often talks about with active inference as a framework or a filter.
4260526	4267890	514	A	0.99998	These are just sort of like different distinctions that might be transiently useful in some axis, like fitting something to a framework.
4268230	4270310	515	A	0.99993	It's kind of the procrusty's bed.
4270460	4286070	516	A	0.99997	Stretch it out so that this perception and then active as a filter, was reminding me of what Matthew was saying, like going out and discovering divergences from expectation of there not being metabolic activity on a planet.
4286230	4290870	517	A	0.98	And then there is some statistical deviation.
4291030	4300670	518	A	0.82	And so, like, in the classical statistical framework, that might be like it's a one sigma difference in the Bayesian framework, well, there's a base factor of two.
4300740	4316130	519	A	0.96	And here for this evidence, and there's other ways to talk about detection of novel entities that might be part of, like, a reification process of the extended cognition of the modelers.
4319420	4321880	520	A	0.78	Then, like, one philosophical angle on that.
4321950	4351620	521	A	0.65	And then also anyone who wants to read, then Ali is this book by Helen Longineau which talks about methodological pluralism and about how there can be, like, disciplinary rigor and the ways in which often unstated, like social priors can be the substance of what becomes understood to be science as, like, a complex phenomena.
4352360	4353940	522	A	0.71023	Ali and then Brock.
4355880	4378140	523	F	0.5458	Adding to what Yakov said, I think the concept of Markov blanket emanates from the Plutonian way of thinking, specifically hylomorphism school of thought as opposed to hylozoism.
4379040	4388332	524	F	1.0	The distinction between hylomorphism and hylozoism is that, well, in hylomorphism, everything is disconnected.
4388396	4394044	525	F	0.99993	Every concept is disconnected and with every other concept.
4394092	4400528	526	F	0.61	And so there's a discontinuity, metaphysical discontinuity between the concepts.
4400704	4424828	527	F	0.99994	But in hylozoism, the philosophers advocating this school of thought, well, they claim that hylomorphism fails at answering the question of what it is adequately, and they even rephrase the question.
4424914	4433584	528	F	0.61	And they claim that the right question to ask is not what it is, it's what it can do.
4433702	4438988	529	F	0.81547	So that's basically the distinction between hylomorphism and hylozoism.
4439164	4450310	530	F	0.99998	But I think the mark of blanket is a way of formalizing this hylomorphic way of thinking.
4451160	4452980	531	F	1.0	At least that's my opinion.
4455760	4457304	532	A	0.9999	Thanks a lot for that, Ollie.
4457352	4458060	533	A	0.99905	Eric?
4468500	4470108	534	A	0.5037	Sorry, I'm not hearing Eric.
4470204	4471840	535	A	0.96729	Can others hear Eric?
4474910	4476570	536	A	0.9997	Maybe I need to reload.
4478050	4479358	537	A	0.89931	Can you hear me?
4479524	4480830	538	A	0.97	Okay, I'm going to reload.
4500250	4501250	539	E	0.99624	Can you hear me?
4501340	4502614	540	A	0.53	Yeah, I can hear blue.
4502662	4503162	541	A	0.95	Okay.
4503296	4504954	542	E	0.99851	You're still not hearing Eric, though?
4505072	4506060	543	A	1.0	No, sorry.
4506750	4509370	544	A	0.96	Yeah, I just did, like, a small disrupt.
4517700	4521152	545	A	0.74	Okay, wait, eric, try again.
4521286	4521584	546	A	0.99	Okay.
4521622	4522192	547	D	0.99404	How about now?
4522246	4524164	548	A	0.82	Yeah, now I can see you in here again.
4524202	4524740	549	A	1.0	Okay.
4524890	4528660	550	D	0.99995	How about everyone else who's the audience?
4529240	4529700	551	A	0.91	Okay.
4529770	4530484	552	A	0.99981	Wow.
4530682	4533430	553	A	0.99536	Disrupt on the high low field.
4533740	4535050	554	D	0.98282	It's happened before.
4537420	4541816	555	D	0.55	I just throw in my two cent about my interpretation of a markup blanket.
4541848	4550248	556	D	0.99983	It's about trying to perform simplifications that make computation tractable.
4550424	4555312	557	D	0.73137	If you have everything interacting with everything else, then we can't do computing on that.
4555446	4571504	558	D	0.99997	So we apply compartmentalization and build objects and interfaces for how the objects interact with one another, and those become tractable.
4571552	4581850	559	D	0.49916	That's what a Bay's net does, is it says what are independent and what are dependent variables on each other.
4582220	4593112	560	D	1.0	And that works well when those abstractions, the objects and relations, nouns and verbs are a good fit to how the world actually operates.
4593256	4610348	561	D	0.99993	So that is a driver for learning or building representations that will use these Markov blankets and put the compartments where they actually are faithful to the compartmentalization that we can abstract over the way the world parts in the world operate.
4610444	4625568	562	D	0.99998	So things that are distant, that separate, that interact only weekly, we try to maybe factor those out, pretend they don't interact at all, or use some other intermediate variables to represent the interaction in order to simplify things so we can do computation.
4625664	4631130	563	D	0.99974	So that's how I think Marco blankets and we'll see if the math tells us that later on when we get to it.
4632060	4632856	564	A	0.9999	Awesome.
4633038	4635560	565	A	0.58861	Brock ethanoli.
4647630	4647994	566	A	1.0	Okay.
4648032	4650150	567	A	0.99982	I'm like not hearing Brock, unfortunately.
4650310	4651180	568	A	1.0	Do you?
4651890	4653274	569	E	0.99924	Yes, we all hear Brock.
4653322	4654766	570	E	0.90773	Brock is reloading, I think now.
4654788	4655166	571	E	0.95109	Again.
4655268	4655870	572	A	1.0	Okay.
4656020	4656478	573	A	0.61	Yeah.
4656564	4663360	574	A	0.93747	Gather does this sometimes, but I don't know if it's because we have 15 people.
4664210	4666946	575	A	0.99	Yeah, but like Matthew said, I don't hear him.
4666968	4669250	576	A	0.54204	It's just like there's different drop offs.
4671990	4674354	577	E	1.0	I can hear you, but I still think Daniel can't hear you.
4674392	4675538	578	E	0.99904	Daniel, you can't wait.
4675624	4676520	579	A	0.99	Now you're back.
4676970	4677558	580	A	0.85811	Go for it.
4677564	4678438	581	A	0.87	Okay, continue.
4678604	4679414	582	C	0.95077	Interesting.
4679612	4680598	583	C	0.99999	Can you hear me?
4680684	4681222	584	A	0.77	Yeah.
4681356	4682520	585	C	0.57	Oh, okay.
4683770	4684518	586	A	0.98	Yeah.
4684684	4689722	587	C	0.91933	This is just this ongoing thing that I don't know, we just keeps coming up about.
4689856	4692998	588	C	1.0	Yeah, well, okay, maybe they exist, maybe they don't.
4693094	4694490	589	C	0.68633	Markov blankets, really?
4694560	4703178	590	C	0.99999	But how would they form in any how would they form an evolving collapse?
4703354	4726690	591	C	0.99997	Presumably there is some point in that process, this evolution part where the Markov blanket is extremely poorly defined relative to the system and that's basically these sort of underexplored areas.
4726770	4756800	592	C	0.99249	It was also in relation to Matthew's question also about the free energy minimization thing where there's systems like non equilibrium systems basically, where still something interesting worthy of study is happening, but perhaps is not free energy minimizing in that state.
4758770	4760206	593	A	0.99998	Thanks for sharing it.
4760228	4761630	594	A	0.96313	Just a few thoughts.
4765170	4783746	595	A	0.77106	Let's just say some sort of meso scale or global as that's called, but that doesn't mean about the whole world, but some sort of global free energy minimization in the joint model is achieved like in a conversation that isn't the same thing as the local disconnected free energy minimization.
4783938	4793702	596	A	0.97302	Otherwise fitting high parameter models optimally would be simply reducing to fitting single dimensional models alone.
4793766	4801450	597	A	0.99998	If we could just do the linear optimization on the standalone variables, then why would we ever need the larger dimensional methods?
4801970	4810880	598	A	1.0	And then think of this textbook maybe with where things could be in the coming years.
4812770	4816762	599	A	1.0	The Markov membrane is like the linear algebra.
4816906	4819920	600	A	1.0	And then Jacob mentioned that this is classical model.
4820390	4826260	601	A	0.73694	It is kind of classical in a sense, in the timeless classic sense.
4826970	4837538	602	A	0.99953	So the one layer Markov blanket when thinking about the rise and fall of civilization is not the end all that's.
4837554	4854110	603	A	0.78	Like I think maybe analogous to a linear regression y equals MX plus B and then you have all these hundred years of development on the linear regression model and all these techniques and applications and pipelines.
4854850	4868770	604	A	0.99993	So the Markov blanket one layer potentially over interpreting it as already presenting with strengths or weaknesses in certain situations when not being just like empirically demonstrated.
4869190	4875300	605	A	1.0	In the general case, we'll see what could be said and when.
4875910	4876850	606	A	0.92804	Matthew.
4879130	4881794	607	H	1.0	Yeah, along those lines, I was kind of curious.
4881842	4888654	608	H	0.99941	I've seen that there's been a decent amount of work on the sort of hierarchical or fractal composition of these models.
4888802	4902906	609	H	0.95462	I'm curious if that implies that there's a fractality to the boundary by default or if there needs there any specific work on sort of hierarchical composition of the boundaries of that so called membrane.
4902938	4903840	610	H	0.99999	As you said.
4907570	4932722	611	A	0.99996	With better annotation, we could have better answers because there's many papers that we've discussed in a guest stream or a paper and there's also like many other papers obviously, that we don't have that kind of annotations of because it's quite common to see nested models in the context of nesting of cognitive processes.
4932786	4936406	612	A	1.0	Like in that San Fed Smith paper, which was I think, number 25.
4936588	4939682	613	A	0.99988	That was about cognition as mental action.
4939826	4946218	614	A	0.99984	So that was nested and the nesting was interpreted as cognitive actions and counterfactuals, basically.
4946384	4954990	615	A	1.0	And then sometimes nesting is used to refer to actual, like, well, the state is inside of the country and then the region is inside of the state.
4955140	4963790	616	A	0.99954	It's implied that the map is mapping onto the territory, maybe even spatially, the cell is inside of the tissue.
4964210	4967060	617	A	0.65	And that's like answering Schrodinger's question.
4967670	4973140	618	A	0.99987	Everything happening with the planetary scale analyses, cellular level.
4976870	4984418	619	A	1.0	And then this is hopefully what is spoken to with the composability of active inference.
4984594	5005962	620	A	1.0	And sometimes that's framed in terms of the lateral composability of you could have three ants interacting or 300 ants and then the nested composability, you could have the fifth and the 7th and all those layers with computational trade offs, maybe with no extra information to be gleaned.
5006106	5016574	621	A	0.63	And then learning the structure of the generative model or just the structure of the partition more broadly and like what the variables are and everything that's the structure.
5016622	5022900	622	A	0.65072	Learning challenge and cognition as structured learning.
5023830	5039750	623	A	0.90973	Hashtag synergetics geometry of thought is what Friston has and others have raised as like a total open area because there's the parameter fine tuning once you have the Bayes graph.
5040510	5047260	624	A	0.9994	So then you're now inside of the ability to reify or not that model.
5047710	5049930	625	A	0.50404	You're just doing parameter optimization.
5050670	5055440	626	A	1.0	We used two factors in this linear regression and then we optimized it with the L two norm.
5055970	5061850	627	A	1.0	Two is the best number of factors, but it couldn't be set at that scale.
5061930	5070580	628	A	1.0	You could say in a two parameter model, this is the best parameters with this norm, but then you couldn't pull back another level.
5071270	5081960	629	A	1.0	And so that's like meta scientific and metabasian analyses, which they're going to talk about later.
5083450	5090434	630	H	1.0	Okay, I guess I'm also kind of wondering if there are any examples that come to mind of something like a system that is structured.
5090482	5110670	631	H	0.99999	Such as the clearest or simplest example that comes to mind is like, let's say that you have a nation and a state within that nation and there is a port and there is an overlap of sort of that port interface to an outside structure that is shared by both the national and overlapping national and state interests and decision processes.
5111330	5121780	632	H	1.0	And so I'm kind of curious if there are examples of demonstrating that kind of composability of generative models or if that's something that's still just new and open.
5123830	5125218	633	A	0.99953	Those are awesome questions.
5125304	5139106	634	A	0.99999	If people know any some areas to investigate, like in the phenomena that you're overlapping interests informally, there would be like shared regimes of attention.
5139298	5148490	635	A	0.98527	There's the question of synchrony and that doesn't mean like synchronization identically but generalized synchrony.
5149630	5152810	636	A	1.0	Then there's like coordination of affordances.
5154690	5157694	637	A	0.5148	We're not going to do this because of that.
5157812	5171760	638	A	0.82809	So that's like in an area that Yaako and others have been working on is just describing that situation as an affordance on an affordance or like E sub E.
5172450	5173694	639	A	0.99988	It's not in the textbook.
5173742	5178498	640	A	0.99992	But if people are staying this long then this is just kind of some ways that some people are thinking about it.
5178584	5182774	641	A	0.57	And these are the areas where people can also do research and learning with us.
5182892	5189350	642	A	0.9998	But affordances on affordances, the safety could be on or off.
5189420	5206318	643	A	0.97378	So then there's like an affordance that modifies another affordance and could those have compositionality just like some of these other generalization affordances for generalization basically, what are those?
5206484	5209360	644	A	0.99	And then isn't it like discovering what those are?
5217150	5240382	645	C	0.83249	Just I think it's kind of also related to that question of this formation evolution, collapse of markup blankets is when does the observation and actions of one system map to the preferences of another and vice versa?
5240446	5245794	646	C	1.0	How does that come into being existence?
5245842	5249762	647	C	0.99998	How does that start to happen and how does it unhappy?
5249906	5250920	648	A	0.96	I don't know.
5252410	5253446	649	A	0.99972	Awesome question.
5253548	5254102	650	A	0.99568	Thank you.
5254156	5264586	651	A	0.88	And another angle on that, let me just check and then Ali is like this is a graph that we're going to look at a ton and we will interpret what all of it means.
5264768	5269050	652	A	0.93082	What is the OASB, pi, g, et cetera.
5269470	5273518	653	A	0.99987	But this is a basing graph like Eric mentioned.
5273604	5280590	654	A	1.0	And the edges are like dependencies, not causal influences in the world, but apparent potentially or different interpretations.
5281190	5283170	655	A	0.92716	Is this the only skeleton?
5284710	5288850	656	A	1.0	No, this is the Y equals MX plus b of skeletons.
5289670	5295386	657	A	1.0	And there's the linear regression in the first equation in the textbook of the stats textbook.
5295518	5298290	658	A	0.9	And then there's all these accessory tests.
5298450	5302230	659	A	1.0	Then there's like creation and destruction as applied.
5302970	5309526	660	A	0.63487	Maybe there can just be a loop that's not active inference, just checking every day if something's within an arbitrary threshold.
5309718	5316422	661	A	0.99987	So there could be some liminal or gray area like an interface.
5316566	5327546	662	A	1.0	I think steven Solette mentioned it as like a nail bed or something, like an interface between more particulate and then less particulate, more field versus the particle.
5327738	5328590	663	A	0.89653	Ali.
5331830	5355010	664	F	0.99043	Well, as a little side note, there's a popular science book coming out, I think in June, namely The Romance of Reality by Bobby Azerian, which touches on the emergence of Markup blankets, the dynamics of emergence of Markup blankets.
5355090	5368070	665	F	1.0	And it attacks it from many different angles, evolutionary angle, I mean, from a cosmic, even perspective.
5368230	5389618	666	F	1.0	And it even goes as far as well, considering the whole cosmos, the whole universe, as, let's say, a kind of Metamark of blanket, so to speak.
5389704	5399846	667	F	0.8	And well, I think that could be an interesting thought put forward by Bob Yadarian in this book.
5399868	5400118	668	A	0.64	All right.
5400124	5401110	669	H	0.99984	Thanks, Daniel.
5402970	5403720	670	A	0.99988	Thanks.
5404170	5415210	671	A	1.0	In fact, he gave part one of what was intended and may still be like a multiple part discussion, but this was him giving that presentation.
5416830	5421454	672	A	0.69639	So we were in contact is definitely an interesting view.
5421652	5427790	673	A	0.74	And it's going to take all kinds of research and education and communication.
5428210	5429390	674	A	0.99449	Jessica.
5432930	5433582	675	B	0.99954	Yes.
5433716	5438594	676	B	0.86	I guess first, join the lab.
5438712	5467462	677	B	0.99762	Some of the ideas that helped me a little bit to start even conceptualizing this, in addition to the filter that you mentioned before, Daniel, and how it could be more like porous or more hard and allow things in and out, but it was also about it could be like just grouping of relationships and interactions.
5467526	5490340	678	B	0.99364	So, like, the closer like a relationship, like different things are, maybe that's more like on biological systems, I don't know if they're closely related or they have more interactions, even though they might be different, but grouping it in those sense and maybe that relates to what Eric said from the calculational part.
5491030	5497300	679	B	0.56673	But that was sort of like some of the things where I started connecting Marco blankets to.
5498330	5518374	680	B	0.9	Okay, if items or different objects and things like they're closely related, you can start putting a blanket around and maybe go through with the idea of wrapping things from some of the definitions.
5518422	5536980	681	B	0.76872	But, yeah, those are kind of like the kind of visual ideas that started helping me a little bit and I still don't understand properly, but those are the things I was like, okay, so relationships, filters, kind of like connecting interactions between things.
5539990	5540498	682	A	0.99995	Awesome.
5540584	5542050	683	A	0.66656	Thanks a lot for that.
5542120	5544130	684	A	0.93	Like interacting entities.
5544650	5552454	685	A	0.99912	So you could have the edges representing some interaction, like when people are fitting a linear model.
5552572	5554290	686	A	0.99791	Interacting variables.
5554450	5564234	687	A	0.53902	So there's this whole discussion topic of whether the interactions are like the two ants bumping into each other, whatever that means in the, quote, real world.
5564352	5566970	688	A	1.0	And then there's like the statistical interaction.
5567390	5572234	689	A	0.87667	So then defining certain variables in statistical models.
5572282	5585700	690	A	0.99999	So leaving that debate behind us and just talking about the statistical models that we have, Bayesian graphs, some variables have edges between them that could be either designed to be there or not.
5586070	5588206	691	A	1.0	Or you could do some sort of like thresholding.
5588238	5592654	692	A	0.99867	Approach and explore that your thresholding parameter was acceptable.
5592782	5599990	693	A	0.99996	But the more of a loose interaction you allow, the more challenge there is to fit that statistical model.
5600140	5623290	694	A	1.0	And you may not have enough data to fit like the ten variable by ten variable with all the interaction terms which is like why when doing linear modeling in a health population example they would like do model selection on what their statistical power is with that data set to resolve certain kinds of effects and correlations and non sphericities.
5623450	5632640	695	A	0.62	And that is addressed a lot in the SPM textbook and Kristen's earlier pre active work.
5633010	5650210	696	A	0.99986	But then you mentioned how to be engaged with that process of the wrapping or the seeing the clusters and then knowing where is there going to be maybe generative models arising that are consisting of other generative models or other generative processes?
5650370	5659820	697	A	1.0	And then some things interact more with others statistically in a model as by design or just as an outcome of whatever.
5660430	5663462	698	A	0.9999	So there's sparse connectivity amongst the variables.
5663526	5665878	699	A	0.99991	They're not like all by all connected.
5666054	5679150	700	A	0.91	And then that sparse connectivity simplifies a lot of things that's also related to like a Lasso regression and also to the below l two norms and then a sparse model can be factorized.
5679730	5699394	701	A	1.0	And that is what allows for the variational Bayesian inference, which is like doing Bayesian model fitting on a factorized because it's sparsely connected graph and so a lot of these discussions are quite downstream of a lot of the philosophy of map and territory.
5699522	5701910	702	A	0.99995	But it's still a super important conversation.
5702330	5728080	703	A	0.99983	However, within the model inference, with a model inference using a model, a lot of these questions are very technical and downstream of importance qualitative things that are also important to keep in mind but of a different type, jessica or anyone else.
5731270	5731730	704	A	0.6	Yeah.
5731800	5733060	705	A	0.99878	Wow, very interesting.
5738550	5740994	706	A	0.997	Here's one other question I guess we can discuss.
5741112	5753510	707	A	0.89	Like as the as it currently stands, there's a 1 hour meeting and then at the end of the hour, the very next hour begins the Tools regular organizational unit meeting.
5756650	5762394	708	A	0.69664	It is the people who are here now but hopefully others would be listening to it if they're not able to make this time.
5762432	5771920	709	A	0.96581	But what will help people with the synchronous and Asynchronous make the most of the next few months?
5773250	5778160	710	A	1.0	Do people appreciate having a longer discussion for this?
5778930	5783220	711	A	0.73	Do people think that the main versus the math group?
5784070	5791700	712	A	0.99997	Is there another subgroup, like a philosophy discussion, that people want to kind of really do this?
5792950	5814570	713	A	0.99978	Because we're experimenting with open endedness on our first cohort and in these early phases of the book and people can probably imagine various of the things we want to balance, like respecting everyone's time and different backgrounds, respecting their preferences for how much they want to learn about different topics.
5815230	5823760	714	A	1.0	Being realistic about how much asynchronous and synchronous, direct and peripheral time makes sense.
5824370	5829360	715	A	0.83145	But also being realistic like there isn't a two minute video for a process.
5830770	5839140	716	A	0.99962	So how do people think about that, those who have stayed this far?
5862720	5864590	717	A	0.50391	Mike and then anyone else?
5868000	5868956	718	A	0.99998	Can you hear me?
5869058	5869804	719	A	0.99997	Yes.
5870002	5870750	720	I	0.85	Okay.
5872240	5872652	721	A	0.98	Yeah.
5872706	5884732	722	I	1.0	I think that as noted earlier in the discussion, there are just so many themes that run through this that there are opportunities to pull on any of a number of threads in the course of discussion.
5884796	5898020	723	I	0.59	And so today's discussion was interesting and I stayed for this part of the discussion simply because of the interesting threads that were being pulled.
5898780	5910440	724	I	0.6	Certainly a contrast with the first part of the discussion around math and I think a lot of uncertainty amongst the attendees about how to engage with the mathematical aspects.
5911840	5929040	725	I	0.99999	Maybe to try and put a point on it, from my perspective, learning about what is active inference and how can active inference be applied in real world situations is a motivator for me participating.
5930660	5937350	726	I	0.99998	Obviously there are also sort of philosophical and maybe more scientific discussions that can take place.
5941880	5950170	727	I	0.99991	Any meeting could touch on any of those aspects as well as some of the asynchronous interaction could pick those up as well.
5951980	5953130	728	A	0.99989	Thanks a lot.
5954780	5955192	729	F	0.79	Okay.
5955246	5958280	730	A	0.809	Anyone can raise their hand here's just a few other options.
5958350	5975148	731	A	0.89	Like if somebody here's something that's interesting to them, we can in the discord make a channel that is relate or people can participate in the regular channels just like questions that's going to potentially be seen and interacted with by people more broadly.
5975244	5985088	732	A	0.99	Like what if we posted questions that we're having we're in the cohort one of the text and we had this question do you know that's one option?
5985174	5998100	733	A	0.83853	Another, and this is like to Mike's expression that applied active inference is a motivator epistemic and pragmatic value, expected epistemic value.
5998170	6007236	734	A	0.99999	We expect to learn a lot by like staying in these sometimes challenging or oblique or whatever discussions.
6007428	6014460	735	A	0.56219	But then there's also expected pragmatic value with applying active inference, learning and applying active inference.
6014880	6023872	736	A	0.99953	So then maybe that is a group we can partition, like an applied active inference group.
6024006	6042580	737	A	0.99989	So then we can be clear about what the focal artifact is because also we want to not all groups at all times will be able to have nor is it useful to have open ended discussions of any discursion length.
6043560	6049050	738	A	0.99888	So like knowing how far and in what ways and how many minutes of people's linear time.
6050220	6058468	739	A	0.44643	Ali yes, the meetings, just one note on the organizational unit meetings.
6058564	6077600	740	A	0.73	The organization units in the active lab like comms and tools for education, communication and tools are like directory 1 hour lab meetings or group meetings because we're not doing the education work necessarily in that 1 hour.
6077670	6092596	741	A	0.99997	But some groups sometimes it's possible to do some stuff, but it's like increasingly moving towards sharing updates from people who want to commit in Asynchronous work or smaller groups that want to commit to doing something like that.
6092778	6100810	742	A	0.99304	So then educational related projects, that's their opportunity to ask for help, share updates and so on.
6101900	6121992	743	A	0.99999	But earlier on there was more topical material, but then through particularization and operations and other approaches, it becomes more like Pragmatic and less discovery and less mixed media role specification, all these processes.
6122136	6136960	744	A	0.9815	So people sticking around is sort of the and being engaged and like seeing an affordance and then just making that contribution, wanting to be a facilitator for a certain project or wanting to contribute actively or just even connect with another participant.
6137720	6146276	745	A	1.0	You can email them if they've provided their information, just some random things.
6146378	6156120	746	A	0.99997	But we want to have the applied angle, the philosophical loop and how to even partition that discussion.
6157820	6168620	747	A	0.87	Like we couldn't just overgo every math, every philosophy, every applied question and have the judge and the jury and all this apparatus.
6170560	6178204	748	A	0.99645	So how can we scaffold that conversation around applied active inference for the people who are like super excited and motivated?
6178332	6179120	749	A	0.82206	Mike?
6181140	6181504	750	A	0.94	Yeah.
6181542	6204330	751	I	0.95	I just want to add there's an interesting duality related to what you just said in that we can't go into fine detail in all of the content and at the same time, I've found this group to be remarkable at unpacking things and sort of really getting into what do we mean when we say that?
6204860	6212910	752	I	0.99906	Types of discussions and what does this term mean not taking things for granted as going through the text.
6214400	6230530	753	I	0.99964	There's a balance to be struck in taking that approach of asking what do we mean when we're talking about this and putting nouns on things and relating it to language and not going too far over into getting into fine detail about things.
6237130	6238630	754	A	0.81507	Thank you, Lyle.
6238970	6240586	755	A	0.95	And then I'll leave with your question.
6240688	6244860	756	A	1.0	Yeah, this firstly great session, really great conversation, I really enjoy it.
6246270	6266930	757	A	0.99993	Most of this is new material for me and so I'm really enjoying the breadth of the conversation and I'm cognizant of this aspect you're digging into is how much do we sort of separate out the pieces and go deep dive in different places versus more of touching on multiple threads and their interactions?
6268150	6286210	758	A	1.0	For me, while I understand there is a balance to be struck there, I'm really enjoying the challenge of relating as an example, the math to the philosophy, to all these different threads together because they are linked.
6286290	6286920	759	A	0.94998	Right.
6288910	6299286	760	A	1.0	I do understand that some of those areas need a separate group that you can drill down into for me personally.
6299318	6302254	761	A	0.65	And so this may be not the same as other people in the group.
6302372	6312990	762	A	0.84819	I'm really enjoying understanding the connections, the philosophy, how these different thought process came to be through history and get that depth of understanding.
6314390	6316270	763	A	0.99977	Thank you, Lyle.
6316430	6324050	764	A	1.0	And for those who want to listen or view, these live streams have many, many themes.
6324390	6327400	765	A	0.99993	So check if there's papers that you're interested in here.
6328010	6333190	766	A	0.99	The live streams is about papers, so there's 46 papers.
6333530	6335862	767	A	0.85909	Guest streams are not driven by a paper.
6335916	6337526	768	A	1.0	Sometimes the person is sharing a paper.
6337628	6341334	769	A	0.99999	But these are like presentations, hearing from different perspectives.
6341382	6345702	770	A	1.0	And if anybody wants to help organize these, that's what we do in comms.
6345766	6359614	771	A	1.0	If they want to facilitate and participate in these discussions, if they want to contact authors, recommend papers, these are all distributed tasks that are leverage points for people who care to just do a ton of amazing things.
6359732	6381794	772	A	1.0	Like if somebody's interested to connect it to a given community and make an artifact or a live stream co organize that, we can catalyze it at the lab scale for individuals who know about the affordance but then want to take that affordance to just have really leveraged impacts in the active ecosystem.
6381922	6390504	773	A	0.9999	So, ali's question and then jessica sorry.
6390542	6392456	774	F	0.78	I don't have any questions you asked.
6392478	6398010	775	A	0.99992	About the timetable for the meetings, like what specific times are they occurring at?
6400140	6400552	776	A	0.99995	Sure.
6400606	6401064	777	F	1.0	Yeah.
6401182	6401812	778	A	0.91	Okay.
6401966	6407740	779	A	0.99912	They are on Mondays at 13 and 23 UTC.
6408320	6418620	780	A	0.99879	There's two meetings to reflect, like education being the primary mission of ActInf lab, and then that spreads them out by time zones.
6418780	6426800	781	A	0.99995	But if somebody really wants to contribute to an area, the organizational unit meeting is not the rate limiting step.
6426950	6434288	782	A	0.99994	Anyone who has attention to contribute will be able to find a regime of attention that is connected to a task that's meaningful.
6434384	6439700	783	A	0.92	The rate limiting step is not people's availability for a 1 hour meeting.
6440200	6442164	784	A	0.99722	It's however much time people want to contribute.
6442212	6447556	785	A	1.0	Whatever practices and things will find something that works for people who want to be engaged.
6447668	6453512	786	A	0.79084	So don't take these meeting times as being like when we're doing it, when we're deciding.
6453576	6463470	787	A	0.99949	Even anybody who wants to can email or contact just the lab email address and be started on figuring that out.
6464580	6465680	788	A	0.5616	Jessica.
6468340	6468752	789	B	0.99944	Yes.
6468806	6473520	790	B	0.98697	This was related to the question about applied projects.
6474020	6498040	791	B	0.84	I was thinking that maybe one thing that we could do is on the project ideas to have a table where people can briefly share what they want to do or just say, okay, I'm interested in machine learning and apply active inference and maybe this specific topic.
6498380	6508828	792	B	0.99995	Who will be interested in discussing this or exploring what to do and then adding the names of the people who will be interested in that.
6508994	6522028	793	B	0.62034	So the person who started the project, then they can start maybe contacting those people and see what time they can meet and start creating their own subgroups.
6522124	6527890	794	B	0.93021	So maybe that's something that we could do to facilitate that in a simple way.
6529460	6532692	795	B	0.98242	So just start saying, this is what I would like to do.
6532746	6535910	796	B	0.99917	Apply active inference while also studying the course.
6536520	6546490	797	B	0.53	And we like to connect with people here who might share the same interest and see what kind of feedback that person can get.
6547740	6548490	798	A	0.99985	Thanks.
6548940	6564620	799	A	1.0	And just connecting and building trust and having like a buddy system or small groups or just people who are on the relatively long path to apply active inference on teams.
6565540	6574912	800	A	0.99986	We don't have the speed dating hot swap activation protocol but connecting with people.
6575046	6580036	801	A	0.93	And then however it's authentic in that relationship.
6580218	6596200	802	A	0.99999	Seeing what you're interested in in three months will be in a pretty different situation, but we still won't have even gone through the second half of the book on the application of the textbook.
6596620	6604510	803	A	0.99049	So there's a lot of time for us to develop ideas and to connect with each other.
6607440	6609084	804	A	0.99988	So thanks for sharing that a lot.
6609122	6624320	805	A	0.87012	Jessica and I tagged you so that we can create a table with the right way or do it however is the right way because it helps enable connections for people who want to connect around applying.
6625220	6641204	806	A	1.0	And also it helps us remember these are the specific reference points in the text that are like our attractor regime of attention for this textbook group.
6641322	6643524	807	A	0.71	Like the textbook group isn't all of active flap.
6643572	6650040	808	A	0.99999	If people want to apply active inference, it doesn't have to be from the ground up, but it totally could be.
6650190	6655980	809	A	0.99989	But there's many ways to apply that are just in different codas that people can get involved in immediately.
6657280	6666930	810	A	0.8755	So if somebody feels like doing things, I hope they feel like they have the agency to do that.
6670180	6677200	811	A	1.0	Okay, any final thoughts on this interesting semi pattern breaking?
6678760	6706508	812	A	1.0	And also yes, one final thought for me is we would have had tools organizational unit meeting at this time, which is why near the end I asked if you want to do different scheduling because in general it's probably not good practice or ways of working to go overtime to respect everyone's time and all of these types of things.
6706674	6714204	813	A	1.0	But also in the future we're in gather so people who want to keep discussing the textbook could go there into a different room.
6714322	6717970	814	A	0.99992	People who want to do Tools can go into another place.
6718740	6730172	815	A	0.99935	So we need to figure out how to do that through the people who want to be there, like these people and the feedback that everybody has in the ways they want to co create it.
6730246	6732880	816	A	0.99992	Tim and then anyone else who has like last thoughts?
6733040	6733412	817	A	0.51509	Hey.
6733466	6738470	818	A	0.97	Yeah, I was just going to say this is generally way more interesting than the Tools meeting generally is.
6741260	6744970	819	A	0.95651	Cross pollination shows great potential already, I would say.
6745580	6746664	820	A	1.0	Yeah, sounds good.
6746702	6771810	821	A	1.0	I just wanted to add to that conversation, though, about someone even mentioned Plato, Socrates and all that and that whole sort of recursive involution of that raification thing you were talking about and sort of the thought processes maybe being almost like a recapitulation of the structure learning and the Kreptasian factor graphs and all that kind of thing you were talking about there.
6772580	6786900	822	A	0.88294	Plato had like a concept of knowledge which he referred to as recollection and this idea way, way back where all learning and knowledge is actually an act of recollecting what we already know.
6787050	6790856	823	A	0.99	And I just wanted to point out there's kind of maybe just more of.
6790878	6792650	824	I	0.93863	An interesting.
6796860	6803064	825	A	0.92453	Illusion or connection, I guess between those two where there seems like what's old is new again.
6803102	6804600	826	A	1.0	Or what have you covered?
6806540	6807530	827	A	0.9999	Thanks, Tim.
6809740	6813690	828	A	0.61652	Anyone else who hasn't spoken or who would like to add anything?
6831220	6831470	829	A	0.62	Okay.
