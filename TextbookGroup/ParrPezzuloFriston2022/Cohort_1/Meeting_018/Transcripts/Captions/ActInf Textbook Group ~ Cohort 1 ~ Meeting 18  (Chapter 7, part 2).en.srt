1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,700
hello cohort one

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,339
it's meeting 18 we're in our second

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,740
discussion on

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,660
chapter seven

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,719
let's go to the questions and see what

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,678
we can explore today

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,359
or see where else to go

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,920
and or

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,260
look towards chapter eight but there's

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,820
any number of ways we can do it so

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,720
first just on chapter seven

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,719
does anyone want to uh

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,700
turn to any of these questions add

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,219
another question add another

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,520
reflection or a thought that arose in

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,940
the last week

17
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,239
one question that I um

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,099
had was

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,080
are there any ways or sweets

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
for for example taking in an analytical

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,760
expression

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,760
and then providing equivalent

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,500
phrasings

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,180
that might have other advantages

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,720
Ali

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,180
you mean by translating it into natural

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,340
language

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,360
or like

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,380
like what we saw in equation 2.5 and 2.6

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,020
like to take in an expression

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,520
and then

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,330
output

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:46,680
[Music]

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,200
um

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,200
isomorphic or I guess not isomorphic but

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,460
equivalent expressions Expressions that

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,200
have the exact same

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,700
value as calculated

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
because some some of the and when we

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,079
look through the derivation sometimes

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,600
it's possible to trace the trail but to

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,479
know which representations of perhaps

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,340
even the same

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,840
functional

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,940
or same

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,560
term

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,280
it seems quite relevant

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,560
actually there's a an AI assistant for

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
deriving formal proofs for mathematical

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,620
theorems but uh I haven't used it myself

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,640
but I'm not sure if that's what you mean

52
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,260
I'll look at the

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,840
book the name of that and what just one

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,620
second I'll post hmm

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,319
maybe there's a way to

56
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,700
um

57
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,300
reformulate

58
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,840
these

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,599
um specific terms from like a Bayesian

60
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,040
mechanics

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,720
uh

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,680
formalism like posterior predictive

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,180
predicted entropy

64
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,040
that looks like something that Dalton

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,299
probably described as well

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,440
the question is whether you can just

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,099
interchange it

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,319
yeah does working with the particular

69
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,799
partition

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,659
enable equations to be operated with

71
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,980
more composably

72
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,019
because we can know that

73
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,300
there are certain

74
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,819
operations that are

75
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,220
um like always sometimes never going to

76
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,700
be valid

77
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,739
I'm just kind of asking I don't even

78
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,860
know if that's the threat with a habit

79
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
um

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,519
so last time we talked primarily about

81
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,440
the

82
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,220
um

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,900
Mouse

84
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,640
in the maze

85
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,018
and we're going through

86
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,600
uh the way that the this the chapter is

87
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,500
layering on

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,800
features of the model

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,100
so first we saw

90
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,220
the mouse just go for it

91
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,720
and now we're going to be uh it gets

92
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
where it gets the queue

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,380
and this comes to our earlier points

94
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,240
about the resolution of the explore

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
exploit

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,280
trade-off

97
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,340
foreign

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,660
anyone can give a thought while I'm

99
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,600
adding it what are posterior predictive

100
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,820
entropy and expected ambiguity

101
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,680
the part of the decomposition of

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,199
epistemic value

103
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,740
foreign

104
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,780
let me just make sure to say the

105
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,039
posterior

106
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,520
predictive entropy

107
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,680
is the expected surprise or the entropy

108
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,680
of the distribution of observations

109
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,960
conditioned on a policy

110
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,460
so we're in expected free energy world

111
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,080
we're talking about

112
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,639
um

113
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,340
evaluating policies

114
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,520
with respect to now putting aside

115
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,060
pragmatic value we're talking about

116
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,919
decompositions of how the informational

117
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,199
or the epistemic

118
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,759
value of a policy is evaluated

119
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
so there's two terms here

120
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
first

121
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,180
how dispersed

122
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,539
is your distribution of outcomes

123
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,840
for that policy

124
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,639
one can imagine that all things being

125
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,220
equal you would want to select policies

126
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,979
that have a tighter distribution of

127
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,520
outcomes

128
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,060
here

129
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,840
we have an expectation interestingly

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,479
um this is italics e

131
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,720
but it's not a fancy e

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,740
do people think there's a difference

133
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,539
that matters or do they think that's a

134
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,199
slight error

135
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,819
I think there should be a typo yeah I'm

136
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,020
going to add it to erata

137
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,800
e is

138
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,819
italics

139
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,259
should be fancy e

140
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,720
okay

141
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,240
it's the expectation

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,580
over our hidden State estimates

143
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,220
condition on a policy

144
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,080
and it's the expectation of

145
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,259
the expected ambiguity so

146
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,120
entropy

147
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,620
of

148
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,139
the a matrix

149
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,840
functionally how outcomes depend on

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,120
States

151
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,919
so this is saying I want to be

152
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,020
I want to be more

153
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,139
um

154
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,319
is it the case that it says I want to be

155
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,940
more certain

156
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,339
about observations

157
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,500
and how they uh map to policy

158
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,539
and

159
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,940
I want to have a tighter a matrix

160
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,360
Eric

161
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,300
so um knife question why is there an

162
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,920
expectation on the right and now on the

163
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
left

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,700
I was also going to ask this isn't

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,440
entropy already the expectation of

166
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
surprise

167
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,920
foreign

168
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,980
just just so another another point of um

169
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,500
clarification for myself that

170
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,860
I want to make sure this is right is um

171
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,959
the um the O tilde is observations

172
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,320
and what we're looking at here is a

173
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,820
functional

174
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,500
Q

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,300
so that's something that's

176
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
that's a distribution

177
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,540
of

178
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,480
observations that will get over policy

179
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,760
and that's what's being adjusted in the

180
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,459
free energy so we're going to explore

181
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,700
the uh the distributions Q

182
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,660
and the otilda's are going to be

183
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,260
um

184
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,660
past observation so we're not not

185
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,700
looking forward there we're looking

186
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,260
past because those are actual

187
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,060
observations they're not predicted

188
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,860
through

189
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,580
um the the hidden States s

190
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,920
so straighten that out

191
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,500
are we sure that oh our only past

192
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,480
observations I believe that past

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
observations are accounted for

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,380
with respect to how they influence

195
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,040
the prior

196
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,519
um

197
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,640
but does otilda also include

198
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,120
future observations

199
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,260
well if so then it has to be an

200
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,180
expectation over something that mustn't

201
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,620
it

202
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,899
like but this is conditioned upon a

203
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,000
given policy

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
then

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,260
these are the this is the time series of

206
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,120
observations

207
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,339
expected under that policy

208
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,260
is the left term

209
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,019
the Q expected

210
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,440
distribution of

211
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,600
observations conditioned on policy Jacob

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,820
I was just going to uh say that I think

213
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,940
I've seen uh this in other parts of the

214
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,300
book as well and I think they use the

215
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,420
H and then just the expectation notation

216
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,939
for entropy kind of interchangeably

217
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,200
um okay if they do but then isn't this

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,380
like a double expectation

219
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,160
this is the this is the expectation of

220
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,260
surprise on the queue but this is the

221
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,760
expectation

222
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,740
of the expectation of surprise

223
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,540
yeah uh

224
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,399
that I don't know

225
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,240
Eric

226
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,579
okay okay but the left term

227
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,739
just um yeah Ali please

228
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:30,060
uh well shouldn't that first line uh I

229
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,060
mean the H the both

230
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,459
H is

231
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:37,500
shouldn't both of them

232
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,079
be as the argument of the expectation

233
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,740
according to equation 7.4

234
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,680
because in equation 7.4 we have the

235
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,040
negative epistemic value

236
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,500
but it's somehow different from this

237
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,880
equation yeah that's it

238
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,420
okay

239
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,660
so in 7.4 we see a re

240
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,160
statement

241
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,380
of

242
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,019
expected free energy equation two six

243
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
let's leave pragmatic value to the side

244
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,260
for now

245
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,920
here

246
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,880
we see fancy e q s tilde Pi so this is

247
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,860
looking like this probably could or

248
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,040
should

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,459
we also see h p o s h p o s

250
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,279
minus

251
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,380
HQ o pi

252
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
okay so let's take the negative of the

253
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,720
first line

254
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,019
the negative of the first line

255
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,139
you can kind of just flip the terms

256
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,440
it's the expected ambiguity now minus

257
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,019
the the posterior predictive entropy

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,380
then

259
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,240
an expectation is being taken over that

260
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,500
oh sorry sorry my bad I felt the the

261
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,019
square brackets I mean it was

262
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,240
encompassing the whole expectation term

263
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,459
sorry sorry

264
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,639
no no you're you're right actually um oh

265
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,260
well there's a lot of layers of it

266
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,220
I I always write as it's written okay

267
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,600
okay yeah yeah

268
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
um

269
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,680
okay wait

270
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,139
I always color my brackets when I'm

271
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,779
trying to do this um okay the the

272
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,360
outermost bracket there actually may be

273
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,980
a bracket I don't even know let's try to

274
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,139
figure it out the outer bracket starts

275
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,720
here on the left and it and then it

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,120
closes okay pragmatic value if we take

277
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,079
that as a standalone

278
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,880
if we take that as standalone

279
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,860
is anyone else seeing a bracket sort of

280
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,240
scenario

281
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,000
if we look at the brackets as a whole

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,660
this first bracket closes this right

283
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,940
Mouse uh I don't think so the first

284
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,440
bracket closes at the end of the S tilde

285
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,380
yeah okay okay yeah parenthesis

286
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,720
okay okay bracket yeah that's okay well

287
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,540
I was confused too I got I I agree that

288
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,639
was I was thinking should we evaluate

289
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
the brackets locally

290
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
but yes they they are

291
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,519
okay good

292
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,440
okay so it's exactly the negative of

293
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,800
equation seven point eight left side

294
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,620
here is the negative of

295
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,760
so

296
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,360
the first term

297
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,220
um let's just say it in terms of picking

298
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,440
good policies

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,480
we want

300
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,180
policies are better with more clarity

301
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,820
about observation outcomes that's the

302
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,260
first term

303
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,360
and a tighter a matrix

304
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,579
that's the second term

305
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,079
okay

306
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,800
middle line

307
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,740
this is a KL Divergence

308
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,600
between

309
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,240
the product two two products of

310
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,699
distributions

311
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,579
both of them are dealing with

312
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,199
o

313
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,440
in the first and s in the second

314
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,259
the Q distribution in the second part is

315
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,980
the same for both

316
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,079
so maybe there's some interactions in

317
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
how distributions of different kinds

318
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,500
multiply

319
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,959
but

320
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,140
it may be fair to interpret this as um

321
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,619
the POS

322
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,480
is the a matrix

323
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,120
and the q o pi

324
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,340
is how observations are

325
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,840
shaped by policy

326
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,340
or another way to say it might be

327
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,200
POS

328
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,900
is outcome expectations conditioned upon

329
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,419
hidden states of the world

330
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,820
whereas this is outcome distributions

331
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,400
conditioned on what we do

332
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,500
I mean to me that just looks like like

333
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,820
base you know base law there because

334
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,000
you've got

335
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,940
um at least in the

336
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,760
in the left side a little bit because

337
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
you've got condition on S and then s

338
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,919
conditioned on pi

339
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,720
so you're just

340
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,539
basically saying you're trying to

341
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,820
figure out what o is from PI through

342
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,678
this intermediary s Delta

343
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,260
oh one so

344
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,960
another angle would be where's this zero

345
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
well this is zero

346
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,220
when

347
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,660
these two are identical

348
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,080
when

349
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,480
the epistemic value of a policy is low

350
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,640
when it when the

351
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,460
resulting o distribution

352
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,039
is being unconditioned by the policy

353
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,500
that we choose

354
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,919
whereas for policies that change how we

355
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,799
think about the a matrix

356
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,200
those policies have higher informational

357
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,740
value

358
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,480
because POS is kind of like a policy

359
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,039
agnostic mapping

360
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,960
but we're like drilling down to kind of

361
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,720
sub variance partitions

362
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,760
of informational value these are

363
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,460
different ways to look at

364
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,820
what makes a policy

365
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,220
have epistemic value

366
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,419
the first one line was coming down to uh

367
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,799
clarity

368
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,900
around the tightness of outcome

369
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,620
distributions

370
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,020
the second one is related to

371
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,059
how

372
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,520
policy

373
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,280
deviates our understanding of the a

374
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,700
matrix

375
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,380
okay

376
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,600
now let's turn to

377
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,580
okay here's another

378
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,640
um italic e not a fancy e

379
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
thank you Ali for this link I've I've

380
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,039
heard of this one the the [ __ ] proof

381
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,380
assistant but I've never seen it used or

382
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,500
anything

383
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,220
yeah

384
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,080
this looks pretty pretty interesting I

385
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,340
wonder if anyone has done that kind of

386
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,760
formal work on proving certain parts of

387
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
fep

388
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,380
and then a more distal

389
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,400
um

390
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,080
question

391
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,900
would be if we have formal ontology

392
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,780
representations for example with sumo or

393
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,080
otherwise

394
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,720
could we make proofs

395
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,100
around the ontology

396
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,080
and the Sumo

397
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,360
um suggested upper merged ontology

398
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,220
we explored some of those things but

399
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,640
didn't didn't go super super far

400
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,320
it was just the the it's it's it yeah

401
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,380
take somebody who knows that area

402
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,799
okay

403
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,559
the bottom term the bottom line

404
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,600
an expectation over q but now our Q

405
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
is on outcomes

406
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,080
not

407
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,120
focusing on the hidden States

408
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,780
then it's an expectation

409
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,860
about outcomes

410
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,460
of

411
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,059
a kale Divergence

412
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,720
between

413
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,020
it's about this is about hidden States

414
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,020
this kale Divergence

415
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,900
is zero

416
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,080
when outcomes

417
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,360
are not

418
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,419
when in addition to policy outcomes

419
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,280
don't change how we think about hidden

420
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,520
States

421
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,200
so when outcomes influence how we think

422
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,840
about hidden States

423
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,220
this is going to be higher

424
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,000
and what

425
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,860
what does on the right

426
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,640
this is a triangle meaning defined as

427
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,580
so q s pi o

428
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,400
is defined as

429
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,620
and this looks like a Bayes theorem

430
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,158
situation

431
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,659
like kind of that chaining that Eric

432
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,500
just mentioned

433
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,520
like you have P of O condition on S and

434
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,740
then you have S conditioned on pi

435
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,820
so then those kind of like

436
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,580
it's like a way to get from o through S

437
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,840
to Pi

438
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,140
whereas this one on the bottom is just

439
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,380
like going directly about oh conditioned

440
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,860
on pi

441
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,559
which interestingly is I don't know if

442
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,419
this is reflected one of these or or in

443
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,179
some subsets of them

444
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,919
um one can think about that kind of

445
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,240
structural model like the minimum hidden

446
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,580
Markov model not even in its full

447
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,380
framing but just like what are the three

448
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,440
pillars of the Hidden Markov model

449
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,620
observations hidden States policy

450
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,880
yes Transitions and so on and so what is

451
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,120
gained by going through an intermediary

452
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,840
hidden state

453
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,220
there's going to be situations where the

454
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,500
observable contains a hundred percent of

455
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,740
the information for policy

456
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,220
or we can imagine situations where the

457
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,679
ability to choose policies

458
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
based upon s

459
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,260
which is where the actual pomdp is

460
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,740
intervening

461
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,299
is better

462
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,240
whereas in a fully observable Markov

463
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,140
decision process

464
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,539
you don't have S

465
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,520
you're just making decisions on o

466
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,299
um kind of just revisiting the point I

467
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,840
raised earlier about what otilda is

468
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
it seems to me that this only works

469
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
when you can when you have the

470
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,520
observations oh tilde

471
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
so

472
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,000
I I don't see how that could how it

473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,280
could be anything like looking toward

474
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,240
the future

475
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,100
because if you actually want to carry

476
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,799
out that um

477
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,900
that expect that that you want to work

478
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,340
out what Q is

479
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,039
or use it you have to compute it and you

480
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,659
have to have the observations to compute

481
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,179
it and and you know the S tilde you have

482
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,140
to have

483
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,679
you know actually pipe through

484
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,299
and

485
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,880
use them so help me help me understand

486
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,779
if I'm wrong with that

487
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,279
okay here would be

488
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,820
um one thought the a matrix captures how

489
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,400
hidden States map to observations

490
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,380
so whether we have a really tight a

491
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,059
matrix or whether we have a super

492
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,340
dispersed a matrix

493
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,720
using the gaussian form for the a matrix

494
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,279
ensures that we can always say what the

495
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,080
most likely observation is

496
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,820
for a given hidden state

497
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,700
if we had a bimodal a matrix

498
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,900
then

499
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,820
there are some issues

500
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,020
but if we use a gaussian form

501
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,200
for the um like which is the laplacian

502
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,419
approximation

503
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,360
it's more tractable it's monotonic it's

504
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,860
more optimizable

505
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,659
so for a given s sequences of s

506
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,419
we can always derive

507
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,059
the expected observations

508
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,679
again those might have a lot of

509
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,299
uncertainty around them but we can

510
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,299
always make a sequence of O's

511
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:03,440
corresponding to any sequence of s

512
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,260
but this this equation makes no

513
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,580
expectation at all nothing says nothing

514
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,140
about what the form of the distribution

515
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,700
is that you use I mean whether it's

516
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
parametric or not parametric or whatever

517
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,539
it's just saying you have a distribution

518
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,960
Q

519
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,020
um

520
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,419
so you know then this is how we evaluate

521
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,659
it

522
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,820
yes is this true for all families of

523
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,440
distributions

524
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,000
Q

525
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,620
Ali what do you think about that or

526
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,559
anything

527
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,200
uh actually it's interesting that uh in

528
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,779
the step-by-step active inference paper

529
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,080
this epistemic value is defined uh

530
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,140
somewhat differently uh I'm not sure if

531
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,539
they're exactly equivalent with each

532
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,900
other or there's some minor uh

533
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,720
differences between them but uh they've

534
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,700
just

535
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,980
defined the epistemic value only in

536
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,980
terms of the expectation

537
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,020
over I mean the surprises of I mean the

538
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,500
difference between the qnp surprises so

539
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,059
we don't have

540
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,620
um

541
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,740
this kind of expression as conditioned

542
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,900
on the S tilde here so

543
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,120
yeah that's

544
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,059
I don't know if they're the same or not

545
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,659
I don't know how to copy the image into

546
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,600
this chat but the chat of The Gather but

547
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,179
or just put it put it in here put it in

548
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,320
the um

549
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,059
question

550
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,799
okay yeah

551
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,360
um well one

552
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,600
one thought is policy is not an

553
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,700
open-ended

554
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,880
policy in its specification is always

555
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,520
going to be of a finite Horizon

556
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,679
so if we're considering policies of

557
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,559
length 2.

558
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,159
um well so so interestingly

559
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,159
this is a policy that includes leading

560
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,039
up to the present

561
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,320
if this is the present

562
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,000
I think we had one meme that was like

563
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,580
what if my T minus one was was t or

564
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,500
something like that but

565
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,919
um this is a policy that right is

566
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,140
influencing

567
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,140
and this is just the variant of four

568
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,700
three

569
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,020
okay but let's just say that we're

570
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,179
considering policy of true future

571
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,360
looking length 2.

572
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,100
then

573
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,279
we're exploring different ways in which

574
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,039
s is going to unfold

575
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,700
with respect to basically B1 and B2

576
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,860
not using that in the superscript way to

577
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,500
mean like two two parallel bees but just

578
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,600
like there's our current there's our

579
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,039
estimate now

580
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,399
and then there's the way that that we

581
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,360
have you know let's just say four

582
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,799
affordances so there's four B ones

583
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,240
and then

584
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,460
you have now there's going to be four

585
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,039
options for S and then each of those

586
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,299
four we could apply the second

587
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,100
affordance again

588
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,220
so there's 16 policies to evaluate

589
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,679
each one is defined by either taking

590
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,419
like B1 B3 B1 B1 B4 B4

591
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,419
and for each of those s

592
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,179
in the next two time steps

593
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,000
we can emit

594
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,580
observations

595
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,260
Ollie

596
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,220
and then Rohan

597
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
sorry reminder my hand just stay away

598
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,220
I'm sorry

599
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,700
rod

600
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,240
my

601
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,360
hello yes greetings

602
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,960
yeah so uh going back to what the

603
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,020
posterior distribution is right so how

604
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,220
far

605
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,460
so is it just that isn't it just that we

606
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,799
assume there's a posterior distribution

607
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,360
of states

608
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,000
like an ideal posterior distribution

609
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,220
that we want to

610
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,559
that free energy that the free energy

611
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,200
principle moves moves the current

612
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,059
empirical distribution towards isn't

613
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,340
that I thought that's what we were going

614
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,419
from

615
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:40,200
the context in chapter one yes so just

616
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,760
just a question yeah go ahead yeah

617
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,179
uh yeah sorry so sorry the cohort one I

618
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,799
think that's what we discussed right so

619
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,620
it's essentially uh trying to maintain

620
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,980
some use races so whatever policies

621
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,860
uh who have performed should eventually

622
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,240
bring the system to that ideal

623
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,880
homeostatic perspective right so uh why

624
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,679
couldn't we just assume like a normal

625
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,840
distribution so even if it is fat tailed

626
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,520
for example if the empirical

627
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,299
distribution is like the key uh

628
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,220
distribution in this

629
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,240
uh formula is you know has a heavy left

630
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,940
tail you can essentially bring it back

631
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,220
towards that by essentially modifying

632
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,140
the policies I thought that that was the

633
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,899
context of this right

634
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,440
yes broadly you're right so when we look

635
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,779
at the full free energy expected free

636
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,240
energy formalization so here's equation

637
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,140
7.4 or equation 2.6 you're absolutely

638
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,779
right that there's a pragmatic value

639
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:49,320
that's based around reducing Divergence

640
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,380
between observations and preferences but

641
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,840
in equation the one we've been focusing

642
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,779
on and trying to really unpack because

643
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,880
again also like otilda is used in

644
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,500
pragmatic value

645
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,840
we're only talking here I mean they

646
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,600
would still be

647
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,720
yeah yeah but but that would make sense

648
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,980
right because uh your your conditioning

649
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,159
on your actions having some

650
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,919
uh effect on the state on your own State

651
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,140
and your state in the world or maybe

652
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,380
some state in the world so you have to

653
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,080
continuously monitor until it comes down

654
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,480
to the expected observation that's what

655
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,519
the generative model would spit out

656
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,000
right so it makes perfect sense and

657
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,760
it's completely coherent in that way

658
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,559
right

659
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,659
yes I

660
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,360
hope and slash expect and prefer that to

661
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,100
be true what you're describing about

662
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,019
like bringing the homeostatic variable

663
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,840
closer to preferences expectations

664
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,240
that is pragmatic yeah but that would

665
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,299
also yeah so that wouldn't it wouldn't

666
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,460
be surprising that hotel does that and

667
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,320
not be distribution as well as what I'm

668
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,120
saying no you wouldn't need it to be

669
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,460
there yeah you're right it is needed to

670
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,260
be there because these are surprises and

671
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,460
entropies and so on about observations

672
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,739
um and then these this part is really

673
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,719
digging into

674
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,139
um decompositions of epistemic value

675
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,639
so these are

676
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,099
there might be two policies that are

677
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,960
both expected to bring your temperature

678
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,099
down

679
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,480
or whatever

680
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,540
but they have different epistemic values

681
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,219
does it matter if it just brings your

682
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,040
temperature down well it would look the

683
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,780
same

684
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,980
um essentially it would have the same

685
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,800
effect so why does it matter

686
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,659
uh why why uh did we have to have this

687
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,399
kind of uh yeah so there will be

688
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,139
multiple policies that would bring it

689
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,060
down bring the temperature down if

690
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,679
you're if the preferences to bring the

691
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,060
temperature down it does not matter

692
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,040
which policy is chosen right so that's

693
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,700
essentially what I think it's being said

694
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,700
okay so yeah as long as you minimize the

695
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,560
expected here's two investment

696
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,859
opportunities from a hundred dollars

697
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,200
150 plus or minus one or 150 plus or

698
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,299
minus 200. which one do you want

699
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,160
that's not what you were discussing

700
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,260
um so it is because they have space is

701
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,240
very different no it's not the same

702
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,339
thing they are the payoff space expected

703
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:29,160
ambiguity in the 200 plus or minus 200

704
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,400
is very very different or and your

705
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,599
Mutual information will be very

706
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,980
different because the payoff space is

707
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,660
different exactly you are essentially

708
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,020
taking yeah but uh if something is going

709
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,780
to bring down uh temperature plus or

710
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,320
minus two plus or minus four I mean it's

711
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,180
not a huge difference as long as it

712
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,920
brings it down right so that that's

713
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,960
essentially what I'm getting at so okay

714
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,079
why does it matter okay so in this in

715
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,560
this modeling the body's expected

716
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,660
temperature is like the expected return

717
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,980
on investment

718
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,020
and the variance around the expected

719
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,359
temperature is like the variance around

720
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,760
the S uh Investments

721
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,980
and so right but they wouldn't be the

722
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,780
same policy is what I'm saying sorry

723
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,880
they won't be the same payoff space in

724
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,119
the second case so if something uh

725
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,960
generates a hundred dollars but has uh a

726
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,700
low probability of going bus so that

727
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,500
there's a high variance that's not the

728
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,900
same payoff as something that reduces

729
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,720
the same hundred dollars but is that has

730
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,780
a lower variance the payoff space spaces

731
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,820
are different and that will be captured

732
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,119
in that uh coolback Divergence that you

733
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,020
have there

734
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,240
that's right I would prefer the one with

735
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,880
the lower that's right that's right

736
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,920
because the payoffs yeah so uh but uh I

737
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,020
think the discussion was around if

738
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,880
multiple things lead to the same

739
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,880
epistemic value and they have the same

740
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,480
payoff why does it matter which one is

741
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,839
taken rate is that last piece there

742
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,400
might be multiple policies with the same

743
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,980
pragmatic value

744
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,980
and then then epistemic value is the

745
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,320
Difference Maker that favors policies

746
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,780
that have more clarity about observation

747
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,380
outcomes

748
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,940
right right

749
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,280
so pragmatic value would say would would

750
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,520
say that's not necessarily true right uh

751
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,900
that's not necessarily true let's say

752
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,960
that uh okay when the payoff space is

753
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,140
completely unknown that the steps that

754
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,200
you're taking uh at T equals one two

755
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,160
three will bring down the uh we'll we'll

756
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,119
have the same pragmatic value but one of

757
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,180
these actions will lead to some very bad

758
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,280
consequences that step peoples 15

759
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,380
because you're giving up something else

760
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:56,640
because if we're talking about

761
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,780
temperature we're in the space of

762
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,460
temperature okay so yeah

763
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,619
all right all right let's uh so let's

764
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,300
just bring it back to the finance okay

765
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,820
the space is dollars that's the dollar

766
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,300
space

767
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,000
uh yeah okay so we could use dollars

768
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,339
numeric fine so we benchmarked the

769
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,839
dollars how many dollars in making

770
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,339
profit so I have two Investments uh one

771
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,619
uh both of them generate a hundred

772
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,079
dollars but one of them requires me to

773
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,359
borrow a hundred dollars in order to

774
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,040
generate a hundred dollars the other one

775
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,560
will generate a hundred dollars over say

776
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,500
50 time steps this would be quicker

777
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,320
the second one where you borrow 100 so

778
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
it would be quicker because you're

779
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,320
borrowing a hundred dollars but there's

780
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,800
an interest rate that you have to uh pay

781
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,980
out so there's a much uh so you will

782
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,440
have to generate much more than a

783
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,839
hundred dollars in order to for this to

784
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,300
be viable okay because you have an

785
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,660
interest rate payout okay I'm gonna try

786
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,079
to follow up here policies are defined

787
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,660
in terms of sequences of affordances to

788
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,740
take

789
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,780
so the affordance here that you're

790
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,579
highlighting is borrowing or not

791
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:15,599
yes but there are actions that would be

792
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,839
like if you have a very high fever in

793
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,640
order to bring down that high fever

794
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,760
sometimes it makes sense to borrow that

795
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,420
hundred dollars whatever metaphorical

796
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,920
variation of that borrowing that you

797
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,200
have to bring it down to something more

798
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,880
manageable right

799
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,400
so it depends on how close you are to

800
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,440
some sort of threshold where it's

801
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,020
intolerable

802
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,560
uh I mean putting it in in more mundane

803
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,700
terms that hey I have I have a bad

804
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,920
toothache it doesn't make sense for me

805
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,359
to borrow a hundred dollars to fix my

806
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,040
tooth I could just brush my teeth and

807
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,320
hope that it goes away but I have a

808
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,420
knife in my back I need to get to the

809
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,500
hospital

810
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,200
it makes sense to pay a hundred dollars

811
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,940
because you're gonna die if you don't

812
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,000
look okay let me try to try to see this

813
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,060
is how I'm seeing that is when we're um

814
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,359
near homeostasis

815
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,260
then yeah we take actions that basically

816
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,260
keep us there and we try not to like add

817
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,900
risk to the situation whereas near the

818
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,359
limits of our homeostatic tolerance

819
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,060
we may engage in high risk behavior

820
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,619
because there's like already a

821
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,380
non-negligible like because of payoff

822
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,780
space is much larger yeah the payoff

823
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,839
space the positive payoff based on life

824
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,440
so when you are when you're closer to

825
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,300
when you're closer when you have a knife

826
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,680
in your back

827
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,900
the payoff from borrowing a hundred

828
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,700
dollars will save your life

829
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,680
but you have a toothache borrowing a

830
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,420
hundred dollars might cause more risk

831
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,000
that you go bankrupt right but you won't

832
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,040
you will still survive if you have the

833
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,079
tooth a toothache you're just short a

834
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,940
hundred dollars which you could have

835
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,200
used elsewhere

836
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,480
there's no way you can use that hundred

837
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,359
dollars if you're dead yeah so it does

838
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,060
it does a much higher payoff borrowing

839
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,359
at that point than it is with the

840
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
toothache example rates it depends on

841
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,280
where you take these actions I got you

842
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,380
I'm seeing the space

843
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,200
are the axes so here we have dollars and

844
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,640
life

845
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,280
and so you're saying that yeah but it is

846
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,500
a multi-dimensional uh this one so if

847
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,160
you think about it as let's say yeah so

848
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,400
uh let's make it more concrete right so

849
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,320
if you have a drone

850
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,920
uh and uh you have a trade-off between

851
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,339
battery life and staying in the air

852
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,160
uh and let's say one of your propellers

853
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,460
goes out uh you know just redistributing

854
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,500
power to the other mortars so that you

855
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,420
stay in the air even though it reduces

856
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,420
your uh hover time makes more sense

857
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,720
because you could Land versus you know

858
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,200
uh trying to fly around and then crash

859
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,220
eventually

860
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,619
because you've lost one motor

861
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:16,320
so but whereas let's say that uh it's so

862
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,680
the other option would be let's just go

863
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,500
faster to a certain destination

864
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,020
then it doesn't really make sense to do

865
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,520
so you're just reducing your battery

866
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,700
life to get to a destination faster but

867
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,020
uh

868
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,880
but if something happens on the wave

869
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,400
which causes you to lose your motor then

870
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,160
you don't have enough battery in order

871
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,500
to enough battery power to distribute to

872
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,420
the automotive so that you can hover and

873
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,220
come down safely

874
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,920
uh does it make sense

875
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,920
uh Eric so this

876
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,839
you know I wonder if we could table this

877
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,160
particular discussion it seems to be

878
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,420
going

879
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,520
um you know and get back to some of the

880
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,140
other questions in the chapter I mean if

881
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,319
I I actually we we had a question that

882
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,240
was pending from last week

883
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,220
that I think is kind of critical to the

884
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,660
understanding of the chapter and I

885
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,800
wonder if we could so you want to make

886
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,480
sure we have time for it running out of

887
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,040
time here yeah

888
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,060
um

889
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,119
and that's the the question about

890
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:15,720
um

891
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,819
what the relative role is of alert how

892
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,619
it actually operates that you learn

893
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,060
something that the rat learn some

894
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,500
information

895
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,839
prior to deciding which of the two

896
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,839
branches of the maze to take

897
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,460
um and the way they seem to frame the

898
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,640
chapter is that well they set it up so

899
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,560
that the rat

900
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,140
um has its preference

901
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,780
for epistemic Value because of epistemic

902
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,760
value of learning which of the two

903
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,560
branches to take

904
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,500
um is a is a bigger term it'll first go

905
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,359
to the bottom branch

906
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,220
and

907
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,560
um learn which of the two top branches

908
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,920
has the payoff then once that's resolved

909
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,380
it knows that then it go then it decides

910
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,480
which of the top branches to go to and

911
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,859
it gets its reward

912
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,700
so my understanding of that is that

913
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,460
and this is my claim in this question

914
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,020
is that

915
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,180
um the rat is

916
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,359
has a preference to resolve epistemic

917
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,259
uncertainty

918
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,119
regardless of whether it's useful or not

919
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,579
so if you added more uncertain questions

920
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,579
like you know um

921
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,619
what color is

922
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,560
um you know my Apple today but there's

923
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,319
no there's no apple to be gotten

924
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:37,980
um

925
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,900
it'll still want to resolve that

926
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,420
question and any other questions because

927
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,540
those are uncertainties so the epistemic

928
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,960
value it'll collect that epistemic value

929
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,760
and then finally it gets around to

930
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,060
collecting its reward

931
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,359
um that's in contrast to a model where

932
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,400
the purpose of resolving epistemic

933
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,640
uncertainty is to gain the reward which

934
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,359
requires look ahead so in other words

935
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,260
the the planner or the policy would be I

936
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,619
try to learn what's needed to collect

937
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,260
the reward I do that and that's posted

938
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,359
as as epistemic value with a purpose

939
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,720
then the the order of operation is okay

940
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,760
I figure out what I need to know I learn

941
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,740
what I need to know then I go and get

942
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,619
collect do the exploitation so I don't

943
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,599
that's what I would expect that this

944
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,460
kind of a framing would give us but I

945
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,420
don't see that that's what you're

946
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,280
actually giving us

947
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,960
all right

948
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,680
here here's how I see that the um

949
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,619
example that we would want to see

950
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,000
would have

951
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,760
a bunch of

952
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,440
um uncertainty resolving this one picks

953
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,760
a number between 1 and 10 and tells you

954
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,839
what it is this one's a number between

955
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,579
one and a million so it's an it's an

956
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,319
incredible information resolving button

957
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:06,540
then the question is can the relevant

958
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,759
sources of information be sought after

959
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,660
um

960
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,920
I think uh the examples is prepared in

961
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,359
several ways

962
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,880
for example the rat already knows the

963
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,160
semantics

964
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,880
that this is related to here

965
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,160
that's been just the structure of the

966
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,480
model

967
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,500
is already preparing that any any

968
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,660
information

969
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,660
any uncertainty reduction

970
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,140
about this like basically it's already

971
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,119
encoded in the model that this bottom

972
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,280
cue is information about this

973
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,180
so this

974
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,579
is kind of like saying

975
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,800
um and this relates earlier like

976
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,079
not only are the those those like

977
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,280
implicit structurally encoded

978
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,440
aspects of knowledge

979
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,540
but also there's parameterization

980
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,700
questions like we discussed

981
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,300
if it really pers if it has a dire

982
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,200
urgency

983
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,660
for food

984
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,760
to um the earlier questions about like

985
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,520
the urgency of the imperative it may

986
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,079
just go for it

987
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:28,020
and say I'd rather have a 50 50 shot now

988
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,440
than a 98 in two time steps

989
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,520
so it depends on how it's parameterized

990
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,280
but even more deeply it depends on the

991
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,680
construction of the model

992
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,380
what kinds of relationships are

993
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,079
implicitly and explicitly being linked

994
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,000
and like that's a a it's like a deep

995
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,200
level of

996
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,819
modeling

997
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:56,819
to understand what would be like a more

998
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:59,460
neutral way

999
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,200
to frame

1000
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,640
this question and it's like well how

1001
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,440
many layers back do you want to pull

1002
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,960
like you could have a pre-play

1003
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,280
where a rat has um an association Matrix

1004
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,380
there's three information sources

1005
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,180
and it's allowed to freely explore

1006
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,119
without any shock or food and determine

1007
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,220
which one of these information sources

1008
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,800
has like a causal relationship to these

1009
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,680
edges and then there's a learned cue

1010
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,839
that now we're in game time

1011
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,780
and now it's going to rely on its past

1012
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,480
learning about which information

1013
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,839
resource is relevant for the pragmatic

1014
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,020
value

1015
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,599
and then it's I mean there's just how

1016
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,200
many layers back does one need to pull

1017
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,260
before the rabbit is not in the Hat

1018
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,940
I think is going to be a serious

1019
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,040
question

1020
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,619
because even toy demonstrations have

1021
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:58,020
been seen as slam dunk

1022
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,520
and

1023
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,119
um they're not

1024
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,819
well instead of bringing up Palm DPS

1025
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,440
here Palm DPS are really good for

1026
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,480
planting but they don't have this rat do

1027
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,920
any planning it seems like they're

1028
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,660
really not

1029
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,900
aspiring very strongly to build a smart

1030
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,700
rat here and they're not achieving it

1031
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,879
either

1032
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:24,359
yeah it's um true because

1033
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,020
uh

1034
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,640
here

1035
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,220
the first movement again

1036
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,440
presuming that the parameterization is

1037
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,460
such that epistemic value is salient

1038
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,380
the first move is dominated by epistemic

1039
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,000
value and they say well now that that

1040
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,700
value has been tapped now it can step

1041
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,040
into pursuing pragmatic value with even

1042
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,380
increased confidence

1043
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,480
um

1044
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,260
but it's not considering

1045
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,619
this the set of time Horizon 2 policies

1046
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,680
that is not being explicitly encoded

1047
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,560
or

1048
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,819
that means that even implicit yeah these

1049
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,700
are these are transition matrices

1050
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,740
these are just the four options this is

1051
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,200
this is depending on where you are

1052
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,200
you can if you're you know you can stay

1053
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,279
you can go down

1054
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,160
yeah does section seven three address

1055
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,879
planning

1056
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,480
and if it doesn't why do we need G

1057
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,880
why can't we just use a one-step

1058
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,500
variational free energy approximation

1059
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,680
what's it's it's saying what's the most

1060
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,180
likely thing for me for me to do right

1061
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,359
now

1062
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,559
is a question about now in the past

1063
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,480
well I think the answer to the question

1064
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,160
is exactly as you said it before which

1065
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,859
is they baked in this particular

1066
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,980
hardwired rat for which in this case it

1067
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,540
it the best thing to do is to First

1068
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,960
explore learn and then exploit so they

1069
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,420
designed it to do only this very by

1070
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,880
wrote to do the right thing as opposed

1071
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,859
to the rat actually

1072
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,200
use it doing any look ahead or any

1073
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,720
intelligence to do the right thing yeah

1074
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,220
it's structurally implicitly hardwired

1075
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,859
and then it's fine-tuned

1076
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,960
because again there's structures where

1077
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,819
it wouldn't do this and there's tunings

1078
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,500
where it wouldn't do this

1079
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,380
but there's there's um

1080
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,420
it's cut kind of in in the tens place

1081
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,940
and in the decimal point

1082
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,119
this example exists in a very limited

1083
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,319
manifold

1084
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,260
of models and parameterizations where

1085
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,140
one step optimal policies emulate

1086
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,119
two-step planning

1087
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,940
like I just happened to love sacrificing

1088
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,119
pawns and taking castles so I'm willing

1089
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,099
to sacrifice upon so that later I can do

1090
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,079
a castle but of course you can't walk

1091
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,220
around with the belief that you love

1092
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,980
sacrificing Pawns

1093
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,079
yeah

1094
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,760
I actually wondered why there was an

1095
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,859
enumeration of policies in the planning

1096
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,839
section

1097
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,960
um

1098
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:52,759
okay

1099
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,660
learning hyper priors

1100
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,460
hidden States on hidden States

1101
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:04,440
seeing hidden States as outcomes

1102
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,300
of other

1103
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,160
hidden States

1104
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,440
so that they can be learned or fixed

1105
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
a little bit of technical details on

1106
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,160
um on a multi-parameter minimization

1107
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,859
Theta being just a vector of parameters

1108
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,359
for the generative model

1109
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:26,520
and dear Schley distributions which I

1110
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,640
think

1111
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,900
could be gotten into but that's kind of

1112
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,859
distribution specific

1113
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,740
creatures select the most appropriate

1114
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,180
data to improve their generative models

1115
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,540
I think there's more that we can dig

1116
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,319
into and explore on similar wavelengths

1117
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,339
like

1118
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:55,380
risk plus ambiguity but then now there's

1119
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,900
an Information Gain

1120
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,400
I thought we just had risk plus

1121
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,059
ambiguity

1122
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,500
then we didn't really

1123
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:15,059
yeah people point to structure learning

1124
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:16,800
but don't they always

1125
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,619
as a way to get around these questions

1126
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,880
but then it's the structure of the

1127
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,619
structure learner

1128
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:27,839
and then people end up with these Turing

1129
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,220
machines

1130
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,240
that don't plan

1131
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,480
people hope that Bayesian model

1132
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,859
reduction

1133
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,780
will be attractable and provide

1134
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,380
heuristics for structure learning

1135
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,960
but I haven't seen any empirical

1136
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,300
examples that come to mind

1137
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,160
where Beijing model reduction was used

1138
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,380
to identify actionable

1139
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,680
lower dimensional

1140
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,879
useful models

1141
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,040
but we know that structure learning on

1142
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,680
the state space of hierarchical models

1143
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,540
is going to be essential active

1144
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,599
inference or Beyond because

1145
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,460
people thought that the explosions the

1146
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,260
the computational complexity class of

1147
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,180
just branching time active inference or

1148
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,460
anything within a model

1149
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,579
this is going to be like exploding upon

1150
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,260
that by several exponents

1151
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,140
and we have these fundamental questions

1152
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,540
about the continuous time interpolations

1153
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:38,720
why are there continuous interpolations

1154
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,680
in chapter seven

1155
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,859
but it's the discrete Time chapter

1156
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:48,180
okay

1157
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,819
next time we come to chapter eight I

1158
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,020
think this will be quite interesting

1159
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,400
we're going to talk about dynamical

1160
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,859
systems motor control

1161
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:57,780
um lockabletera we'll have some

1162
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,720
Justified continuous lines

1163
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,900
um LaPlace assumption Lorenz live stream

1164
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,540
number 32 stochastic chaos and Markov

1165
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,020
blankets

1166
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,760
Hybrid models with discrete continuous

1167
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,079
Fusion

1168
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,460
and

1169
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,500
some advances in continuous time

1170
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,780
modeling

1171
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,099
thanks everybody

1172
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,619
see you soon

1173
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,220
thanks everyone
