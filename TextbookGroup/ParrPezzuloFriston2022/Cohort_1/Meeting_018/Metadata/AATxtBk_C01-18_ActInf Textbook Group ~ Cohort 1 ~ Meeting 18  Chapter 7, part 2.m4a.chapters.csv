650	24622	00:00	Hello, cohort one. We're in our second discussion on chapter seven. Let's go to the questions and see what we can explore today. There are any number of ways we can do it.	We're in our second discussion on chapter seven of the book	C cohort one
24676	231890	00:24	Are there any ways or suites for, for example, taking in an analytical expression and then providing equivalent phrasings? Does working with the particular partition enable equations to be operated with more composably?

232260	992110	03:52	What are posterior predictive entropy and expected ambiguity? They're part of the decomposition of epistemic value posterior. Why is there an expectation on the right and not on the left? Isn't entropy already the expectation of surprise?	What are posterior predictive entropy and expected ambiguity?	Predictive entropy and expected ambiguity in the

When the epistemic value of a policy is low, when the resulting O distribution is being unconditioned by the policy that we choose, those policies have higher informational value.

1225450	1728666	20:25	The A matrix captures how hidden states mapped observations. Using the Gaussian form for the A matrix ensures that we can always say what the most likely observation is for a given hidden state. Could we make formal ontology representations, for example with Sumo or otherwise, could we make proofs around the ontology?	Ali: Q is an expectation about outcomes not focusing on the hidden states	Ontology and the hidden Markov model
1728768	1866552	28:48	Policy is not an open ended policy in its specification is always going to be of a finite horizon. So if we're considering policies of length two, then we're exploring different ways in which S is going to unfold with respect to basically B one and B two. There's 16 policies to evaluate.

1866686	2278004	31:06	So it's essentially trying to maintain some form of homeostasis. Whatever policies you have performed should eventually bring the system to that ideal homeostatic perspective. There may be multiple policies with the same pragmatic and epistemic value that favors policies that have more clarity about outcomes.

There are actions that would be like if you have a very high fever, sometimes it makes sense to borrow that $100. When we're near homeostasis, we may engage in high risk behavior.

2580060	3383050	43:00	The rat has a preference to resolve epistemic uncertainty regardless of whether it's useful or not. That's in contrast to a model where the purpose of resolving uncertainty is to gain the reward. It depends on how it's parameterized.
