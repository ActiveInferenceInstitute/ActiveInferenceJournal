What do chapters six and nine address that chapter four doesn't?	Second discussion on chapter nine, model based data analysis is underway	Generative Modelation 9
280300	1284570	04:40	Eight chapters on active inference. One chapter on active, one chapter on the primary domain. Chapter nine on models of false inference. How we can computationally model mental disorders. Could have significant application in any sense of the word.	Chapter four is about the generative models that are being specified	Active Inference: The Mental Disorders
1286300	1862800	21:26	It says ultimately the pathology is a consequence of aberrant prior beliefs. Is another way of saying this, like in the Ocular motor. Disorder case, like a kind of neurobiological bias in some kinds of cells. Different meanings in different contexts actually sort of bleed into each other.	Ali: It says ultimately pathology is a consequence of aberrant prior beliefs	Aberrant Prior Beliefs and Psychopathology
1865060	2078090	31:05	Aberrant prior beliefs is like, what? The first is aberrant. Prior beliefs are not intrinsically aberrant, whether they're subconsciously or consciously held. But there's the niche and especially just the human cultural when we're talking about these felt beliefs.	Okay, so beliefs and priors and this question of disorders of inference	Inference disorders of belief and priors
2081660	2627310	34:41	Author of book on social descriptions of mental illness diagnosis. Could have a generative model for these conditions and scenarios that integrates different types of information in a situational way with the sparse model. Requires personally held commitment to pluralism.	Ali Bayrist: This book explores different approaches to mental illness diagnosis	Foucault on Social descriptions of mental illness
2628900	3136096	43:48	The separation between the generative model and the priors. Society and or the niche defines aberrant behavior as one that does not conform to expectations. If you had a more complex model and models are more complex, then there's a lot more associated challenge.	The separation between the generative model and the priors is important in schizophrenia	The separation between the generative model and the priors
3136198	3462880	52:16	Ten Minsky active inference as a unified theory of sentient behavior. By framing attention, memory, anticipation under common computational framings and a unified imperative it's possible to integrate different kinds of phenomena. There's a lot in it. We'll talk about it next time.	Ten Minsky active inference as a unified theory of sentient behavior	10 Minsky Active Inference
