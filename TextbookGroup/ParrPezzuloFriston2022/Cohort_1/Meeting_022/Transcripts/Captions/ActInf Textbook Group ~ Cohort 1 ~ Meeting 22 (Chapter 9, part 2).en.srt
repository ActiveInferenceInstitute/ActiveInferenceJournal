1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,860
hello thanks for all joining it's active

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,480
textbook group

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,500
cohort one meeting 22

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,080
chapter 9 on October 28th

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,940
okay

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,279
we're in the seconds

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,439
discussion on chapter nine

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,859
model based data analysis

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,260
wouldn't like to

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,180
add anything they want

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,760
or mention how

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,440
the generative model discussion from

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
the previous

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,040
one hour

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,160
relates to model based data analysis

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,020
how does chapter four relate to chapter

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,440
nine

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,479
what does chapter nine

19
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,140
address

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,119
went to chapters 6 and 9 address that

21
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,619
chapter 4 doesn't

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,939
um I mean six is about thinking about

23
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,080
applying it

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,640
and uh like incredibly kind of

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,479
simplified

26
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,619
step-by-step kind of way

27
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,220
and 9 is very specifically about

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,380
answering scientific questions with it

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,399
and doing that uh with a sort of

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,500
this metabasian

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,820
it's like an almost nested

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,580
sort of schema of active immigrants

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,319
so I mean that's

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,760
the through line

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,800
I guess but

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
um

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,640
I'm not sure more than that you have to

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,480
say

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,239
that's really you know insightful thank

40
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,080
you Ali

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,739
uh yeah uh actually I would compare it

42
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,099
to a kind of learning how to

43
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,480
uh solve problems uh in I don't know

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,599
mathematics or I don't know uh physics

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
or other areas for example in

46
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,140
chapter 4

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,260
we we

48
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,760
acquired some necessary knowledge uh or

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,140
prerequisite about how to uh how to

50
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,099
think about uh the the phenomena or the

51
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,519
problem we're dealing with chapter six

52
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,280
kind of outlines a road map uh a roadmap

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
about

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,140
um how exactly we should proceed to

55
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,200
solve that problem in a kind of

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,659
formulaic way

57
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,319
and chapter nine uh actually uh in

58
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,379
chapter nine we get our hands dirty and

59
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,400
try to solve some of the actual or

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
empirical problems with the tools or

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,780
techniques we learned in chapter four

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,480
and six so in this um case I somehow

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,640
think of chapter 9 as a kind of uh case

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,340
study

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,280
well kind of cases studies or a kind of

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,360
solved problem section of uh this

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,080
textbook and uh yeah

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,260
I don't know how much

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,380
that captures their nature

70
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,000
that's great wow great thoughts I I

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,660
totally agree

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,419
let's look at the table of contents

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
chapter one special

74
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,940
overview chapter

75
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,160
mirror symmetry same but different with

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
10.

77
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,080
so now in the middle eight chapters

78
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,600
two chapters

79
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
on the low road and the high road

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,660
helping to two different approaches

81
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,080
which can be developed like

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,840
in a lot more detail

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,479
to approach active inference

84
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,000
from two fascinating and

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,060
non-controversial starting points

86
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,840
Bayesian inference from the low road

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,639
free energy principle

88
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,259
and the repeated measurement persistence

89
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,860
imperative

90
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,699
chapter four

91
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,539
is the first chapter on active inference

92
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,699
active inference is about the generative

93
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,460
models that are being specified

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,020
and how they're being computed

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
after just one chapter on active

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,039
inference

97
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,940
it goes to the area where the most

98
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,880
research and modeling has been done in

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
active inference

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,259
which is computational manalien

101
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,220
neuroanatomy

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,060
one chapter on active one chapter on the

103
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,840
primary domain

104
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
first half of the book

105
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,440
second half of the book

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,300
this is

107
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,699
the part where you're going to be

108
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,740
in parallel

109
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,960
perhaps on your first but perhaps not on

110
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,520
your first reading

111
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,100
you're going to be doing

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,419
playing through these

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,960
applied aspects of modeling

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,660
first is the recipe for Designing active

115
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,520
inference models

116
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,819
in chapter six as both of you

117
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,819
have um very nicely

118
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,180
set

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
then

120
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,840
the

121
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,660
figure 4.3 dialectic

122
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,360
discrete continuous time

123
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,199
is Revisited in two chapters

124
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,699
because

125
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,440
it probably

126
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,800
it's one key difference it's a minimum

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,759
of two

128
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,979
so it prevents like any like oh well it

129
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,600
has to be a pmdp it's like well

130
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,120
obviously not

131
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,220
so it keeps the space of generative

132
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,020
modeling open

133
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,139
and it allows for a discussion of the

134
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,800
very interesting topic of

135
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,819
hybrid active inference nested models

136
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,720
with continuous actuators for example

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,660
but discrete decision-making apparatus

138
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,900
so it just is like wanting to cover

139
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,479
these two key types of models in a bit

140
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,699
more detail than was addressed in

141
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,840
chapter four

142
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,639
but this was the first possible moment

143
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,979
to address it after

144
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,500
4.3 just kidding maybe about

145
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,419
then chapter nine or

146
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,539
yeah where we are now which is just okay

147
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,520
you've built your just pure discrete

148
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
time pure continuous time or hybrid

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,740
generative model

150
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,780
if it's a toy model you can just

151
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,940
generate data and just do whatever you

152
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,840
want

153
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
or

154
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,500
you might have

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,660
data from sensors or real world or

156
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,280
however

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
that's in the data format that your

158
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,319
generative model expected to receive

159
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,560
which was part of your design process

160
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
you could have determined what structure

161
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,059
literally the data is going to be in

162
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,580
is it going to be like yes data can be

163
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,339
reshaped but just broadly

164
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,399
is it like

165
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,860
256 sensors in a row of one or is it

166
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,779
like eight by eight

167
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,420
just those kinds of questions

168
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,339
so that when the data start coming in

169
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,680
for the experiment

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,540
whether you generated the data from the

171
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,120
generation generative model

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,459
or whether you're using it in a purely

173
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,940
recognition model capacity

174
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,980
on real world data

175
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,760
um

176
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,700
what does it look like to do statistical

177
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,500
modeling

178
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,080
with these statistical models that we've

179
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,680
been using

180
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,500
and then chapter 10 is a review

181
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,519
it restates what each chapter does

182
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,180
provide some further thoughts

183
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,580
and just summarizes

184
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,160
the unifying capacity

185
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,019
of active inference modeling

186
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,620
then they're the appendices

187
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,420
Ali

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,240
and also one uh in my opinion a very

189
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,060
interesting section of chapter nine is

190
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,820
uh the section on

191
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,240
models of false inference section 9.7 in

192
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,940
which there's an interesting

193
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,279
definition of the disorders

194
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,240
I mean the mental disorders and how we

195
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
can actually

196
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,500
computationally model those uh different

197
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,440
disorders

198
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,019
sorry it says that

199
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,560
here the the disorder does not

200
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,660
necessarily imply that the inferential

201
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,300
mechanism is flawed in most of the

202
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,160
studies the inferential mechanism

203
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,980
operates normally but based on a flawed

204
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,120
generative model so that's basically

205
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,240
what we had learned about how we can

206
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,399
somehow update our beliefs or correct

207
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,680
their perceptions based on either

208
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,420
refining our generative model or

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,839
modifying our generative model or

210
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,000
um somehow sometimes we can just well

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,480
act upon those errors and try to reduce

212
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,779
our uncertainties but in this case uh

213
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,040
it's a very interesting point and uh

214
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,880
the case of computational pathologies

215
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,920
because

216
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,880
oftentimes people ask well what does

217
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,760
active inference actually explain

218
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,180
so I think this is a very good example

219
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,959
of it's a very meaningful and

220
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040
significant application uh I mean in any

221
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,300
sense of the word so if we can uh

222
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,240
somehow computationally

223
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,240
model these kind of disorders uh will

224
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
most probably have a much better

225
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,019
understanding of its origin

226
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,680
and the way to

227
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,779
probable

228
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,600
treatments of those disorders and many

229
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,899
other applications uh can come to uh

230
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,560
comes to mind but yeah I think this part

231
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,899
of the chapter 9 is something that was

232
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,779
not addressed quite explicitly in the

233
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,140
previous chapters and I in my opinion is

234
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,640
the most interesting part of this one

235
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,300
great awesome yeah it reminds me of the

236
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,100
table in chapter four

237
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
of chapter five with the

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,760
neurotransmitters

239
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,320
so that was they were still at the

240
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,399
Oregon systems level in chapter five

241
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,120
but five is very much related to nine I

242
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,519
guess in that sense as well

243
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,920
because it's like it's like here's what

244
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,480
dopamine does here's what acetylcholine

245
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,519
does just

246
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,880
at the computational model level

247
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,279
and then here it's like

248
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,100
that computational model was fit like

249
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,180
between

250
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,920
the phenomena

251
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,339
like attention or policy Precision

252
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,079
however

253
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,899
phenomena to a molecule

254
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,459
in chapter five

255
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,660
here

256
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,139
the phenomena is being connected to a

257
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,940
real human clinical application

258
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,019
so it's not that we're saying

259
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,579
or anyone is saying or you know anything

260
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,399
like that that the molecule is being

261
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,800
pure directly linked

262
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,240
to

263
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,260
this paper even if it's mentioned

264
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,600
the direct linkage approach is

265
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,240
people in group X have more molecule

266
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,899
have less molecule

267
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,139
and even the neural Imaging approach

268
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,060
can be seen as a variant of that which

269
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,240
is people in group X have more brain

270
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,139
activation pattern

271
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,019
in computational pathology

272
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,740
those kinds of biochemical measurements

273
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,920
and neuroimaging measurements can and

274
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,639
they are used

275
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,240
however

276
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,200
this type of computational modeling

277
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,899
is referring to

278
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,120
parametric modeling

279
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,040
where the parameters

280
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,740
are related to the Pathology

281
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,199
so it's not an a priori classification

282
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,320
of those with and without

283
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,959
and then descriptive statistics showing

284
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,199
that a biochemical or a brain Imaging

285
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,980
pattern are differentially expressed

286
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,440
that's descriptive statistics

287
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,079
it's not computational pathology it

288
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,579
might be precision

289
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,100
pathology

290
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,139
but it could still be Precision or big

291
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,480
data or however with just like purely

292
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
doing data summaries doing a random

293
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,000
forest model to diagnose

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,560
these models have a cognitive

295
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,899
structural hypothesis about the nature

296
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,959
of these phenomena

297
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,300
like the ocular motor syndromes again

298
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,920
it's not just people with the diagnosis

299
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,420
and without it's a neurocognitive model

300
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,399
of eye Behavior

301
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,380
and then

302
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,899
explanations can be made

303
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,399
from clinical data

304
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,779
by rendering various aspects of the

305
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,980
generative model conditionally

306
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,720
independent of others ocular motor

307
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,760
syndromes such as intranuclear

308
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,860
optimalges

309
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,880
may be induced

310
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,040
so if you just were diagnosing these as

311
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,180
different conditions maybe they have

312
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,519
similar etiologies

313
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,500
how the condition arises maybe they have

314
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,160
different maybe they have multiple

315
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,120
but these two conditions

316
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,579
computationally can be understood as

317
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,940
parametric modulating

318
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,620
in a computational model of ocular motor

319
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,160
Behavior

320
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,380
this isn't people with internuclear

321
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,760
opto-date

322
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,860
have higher glucose

323
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,320
or lower glucose or this brain region or

324
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,820
this

325
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,440
aspect of them

326
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,779
those are all absolutely valid

327
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,300
approaches

328
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,579
that's like scientific methodological

329
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,500
pluralism

330
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,120
which is like it's okay that people want

331
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,740
to do different approaches everybody's

332
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,480
contributing

333
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,880
to a common

334
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,620
people who care about this and are

335
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,680
creating high quality reproducible data

336
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,380
their data will always be useful

337
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,120
and their perspectives are valid and we

338
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,099
don't want to have

339
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,260
um a discourse space on inter-nuclear

340
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,119
optimal Malaysia

341
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,619
that's

342
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,480
um

343
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,559
you know

344
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,859
like uh saying that one model is like

345
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,599
simply

346
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,040
the only correct model

347
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,299
this paper makes a positive contribution

348
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,660
and points to some new

349
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,919
ways of thinking about

350
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,059
various

351
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,899
pathologies

352
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
and Thinking Beyond the ways that

353
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,860
they've been

354
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,860
worked on before

355
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
one can imagine that before 2000 and so

356
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,760
on you had what health records

357
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,200
and you have some double-blind

358
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,480
experiments

359
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,419
and so you might do a meta-analysis to

360
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,400
find correlations with features of

361
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,020
people and all of those things that

362
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,880
we've been describing

363
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,620
but it was not plausible

364
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,900
to actually implement

365
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,460
computational models of these phenomena

366
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,020
now interestingly that's something that

367
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,840
can be worked on by researchers

368
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,820
directly

369
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,240
and then somebody can a a doctor could

370
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,820
download

371
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,780
ocularmotor syndromes Dot

372
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,740
programming

373
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,419
dot you know

374
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,940
whatever it is but this can be developed

375
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,179
in a pure research context

376
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,340
and the generative model is like the

377
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,879
interface

378
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,640
for the kind of information

379
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,919
[Music]

380
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,900
that might not be available to the

381
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,640
person developing the generative model

382
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,640
because it relates to a lot of problems

383
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,380
and issues about data

384
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,320
availability

385
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,919
that's one's kind of just side note

386
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,200
but that's all but really thanks for

387
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
raising that point and then I just

388
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,860
wanted to emphasize

389
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,480
and unpack

390
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,179
which is that these this table which is

391
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,039
taking up two and a half pages of a

392
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,320
pretty short book

393
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,460
is describing

394
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,620
these are like the cases that can be

395
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,780
brought up which they're providing in a

396
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,520
helpful table

397
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,100
for what active inference describes

398
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
so if the principle of least action

399
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,020
gauge Theory Etc

400
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,460
sophistication does not interest one

401
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,820
these are more pragmatic value

402
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,919
now that will probably move the goal

403
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,600
post to

404
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,000
show me where the computational modeling

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,400
helped somebody with delusions

406
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,340
and that's a Fine Place to want to go

407
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
but it's also a standard and an approach

408
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,780
that

409
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,480
it's not related to the substance of the

410
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,380
theoretical development

411
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,880
I mean I think you could probably

412
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,500
do the response to that question might

413
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,360
be something like

414
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,960
the difficulty of

415
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
implementing that model in a way that

416
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
provides

417
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,620
you know actionable

418
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,299
real-time

419
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,200
you know affordances to address

420
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,860
the aberrant priors in a way that's

421
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,080
causally you know going it's going to

422
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,640
actually affect that uh system is

423
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,799
we need

424
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,740
you know either more compute or a

425
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,780
particular kind of algorithmic medicine

426
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,320
that doesn't exist yet or Etc like but

427
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,460
that's not

428
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,700
a problem with the particular approach

429
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,880
it's just an insufficiency of

430
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,559
ability to enact it I guess

431
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,400
um

432
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,700
but I wanted to ask a question

433
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,620
um

434
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,799
about specifically this uh

435
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,919
aberrant prior beliefs it says

436
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,299
ultimately the pathology is a

437
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,860
consequence of average height beliefs

438
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,020
it's not the generative model advert

439
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,539
product boost is that

440
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,860
um

441
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,100
I think I think this is like I'll use

442
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,140
point is and everything that you just

443
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,640
went through is correct that this is

444
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,740
kind of where the rubber really meets

445
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,460
the road for

446
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,620
its value and demonstrating or whatever

447
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,820
um but

448
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,900
um

449
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,260
I'm wondering also

450
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,860
to me that there's like a easy confusion

451
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,460
thing there about beliefs and priors and

452
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,200
so

453
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,760
um well if they just believed the right

454
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
thing

455
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,600
then they wouldn't have these you know

456
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,940
um so that's not that's not really what

457
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,360
that means though right so uh like is

458
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,580
another way of saying this like in the

459
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,840
Oculus motor

460
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,220
uh

461
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,700
you know disorder case like a you know

462
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,360
kind of uh

463
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,000
neurobiological like you know bias in in

464
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,820
some kinds of cells or whatever right

465
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,580
for that's like

466
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,039
you know pathologically different than

467
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,419
normal or whatever like

468
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,500
some you know receptor for a particular

469
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,740
chemical or whatever is that

470
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,740
a kind of thing that the way of saying

471
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,080
that differently that you know that

472
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,340
particular case that is

473
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,840
more commensurate with what they're

474
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,580
actually saying there

475
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,799
or like you know more commensurate but

476
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,179
just

477
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,840
not relying on

478
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,720
jargon and or

479
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,780
domain knowledge specific for what I

480
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,720
mean by beliefs and prayers is that

481
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,520
or is that not right

482
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,740
yeah well there's a lot

483
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,039
there are you talking about the

484
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,039
comparison of the terms beliefs and

485
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,600
prayers

486
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
in relationship to the way people might

487
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,919
naturally interpret such

488
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,200
beliefs to be and they may indeed be

489
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,840
people's beliefs about the world in the

490
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,980
conversational sense

491
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,780
like some beliefs are just your retinal

492
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,000
States

493
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,580
but other states of the world as if or

494
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,480
really

495
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,039
are your States on other things

496
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,760
right

497
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,200
um yeah I mean I'm I guess I'm asking if

498
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,179
beliefs is

499
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:24,960
um

500
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,140
but in some cases it is beliefs but uh

501
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,880
it's also another way of stating

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
if another way of stating that is like a

503
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
like physical like a structural

504
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,220
like systemic bias for one thing or

505
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,960
another or whatever you know in that

506
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,580
context is that um

507
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,480
you know the like physical or

508
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,400
informational kind of

509
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,260
non

510
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,539
-folk psychology

511
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,520
does that commensurate with what they

512
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,320
mean by beliefs there

513
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,500
okay let's try that yeah Ali please

514
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,520
first

515
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,440
sorry uh I'm sorry but you mean uh the

516
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
um statistical use of the word uh belief

517
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,640
because

518
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,659
um in statistics and in folk psychology

519
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,140
uh as far as I know this term is used in

520
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,580
quite different ways yeah so uh I guess

521
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,419
that which what you're talking about is

522
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,279
uh these statistical sense of the word

523
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,360
belief and if it maps onto the folk

524
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,940
psychological uh sense of this term or

525
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,260
uh am I missing something here

526
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,620
um well let's just take two steps back

527
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,779
for a second and just in the text it

528
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,580
says

529
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,659
um

530
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,779
at the bottom of page

531
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:03,600
185 here that at the top of that yeah uh

532
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
it says

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,860
um

534
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,260
the infertile uh mechanism operates

535
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,659
normally but based uh on a flawed

536
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,460
generative model this means that

537
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,200
ultimately pathology is a consequence of

538
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,539
aberrant prior beliefs

539
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:22,679
yeah and I'm and I'm asking

540
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,679
um a kind of just

541
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,480
explicate different whatever uh

542
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,520
right there in in the context of

543
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,500
psychological disorders which is not

544
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,360
necessarily pathology but I'm just you

545
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,039
know if you tell somebody oh yeah it

546
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,679
helps with uh it was the the impetus or

547
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,720
whatever for this whole thing was

548
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,340
to think about

549
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,480
um

550
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,460
yeah like specifically like

551
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,320
schizophrenia and other you know but

552
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,900
that's

553
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,440
immediately

554
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,200
kind of puts it in that category or that

555
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,960
context of definitions and so uh just uh

556
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
kind of

557
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
you know Nuance the term their beliefs a

558
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,620
little bit

559
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,880
um

560
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,260
yeah

561
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,240
is it commensurate with the rest of the

562
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,980
text

563
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,520
uh to say like in the case of this you

564
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,799
know like specifically of uh this uh

565
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,820
oculine motor uh disorder category

566
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,039
like you're saying beliefs in the retina

567
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,980
or something like that that is

568
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,860
um like cones like being sensitive to

569
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,900
something they they well it's just what

570
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,760
they are sensitive to and in this

571
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,620
particular person

572
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,679
you know they're just sensitive to or

573
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,320
whatever the relevant you know structure

574
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,900
is there but it's you know sensitive to

575
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,919
to something right and that's its belief

576
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,380
you know in some sense

577
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,440
um

578
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,299
what's the statistical definition or

579
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,400
anything like that but just is a

580
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,460
is that completely off track or is that

581
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,140
I have a thought but Ali if you want to

582
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,919
make a response please

583
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,559
uh yeah uh I think that this term

584
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,340
believe and it's uh different meanings

585
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,700
in different contexts uh actually uh

586
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,360
sort of bleed into each other and uh

587
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,179
there cannot possibly be uh separated uh

588
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,640
cleanly from uh from each other so

589
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,039
um in this particular case I believe

590
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,880
that the word belief

591
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,679
uh in the is part and partly is um

592
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,919
this folk psychological uh sense of the

593
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,539
word and uh partly it's based on the uh

594
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,659
kind of philosophical slash

595
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:56,279
epistemological uh sense of this word

596
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,840
because uh especially in epistemology uh

597
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,779
when uh philosophers talk about belief

598
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,039
usually they don't mean just the folk

599
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,720
psychological sense of this term

600
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,799
although it relates to that concept but

601
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,039
it's much more nuanced than that so uh

602
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,460
in the case of ocular motor pathology

603
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,179
well I believe that the word belief

604
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,340
somehow can be interpreted in a little

605
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,320
more abstract philosophical sense or

606
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,140
epistemological sense of this word than

607
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,000
our

608
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,940
both psychological sense of it so uh but

609
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,500
again

610
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,740
I think it also has some overlappings

611
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,440
with uh the folks psychological sense of

612
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,980
it as well

613
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,320
great thought

614
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,779
just to kind of reset that then say what

615
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,020
I was planning to before so here it's

616
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,460
situational

617
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,159
um where people talk commonly about uh

618
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,380
don't talk about beliefs like the I like

619
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,480
where it believes it should be looking

620
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,799
[Music]

621
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,640
um

622
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,860
people don't talk about that but there

623
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,360
might be another cognitive model that

624
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,500
does align very well within expressed

625
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,480
felt cognitive belief

626
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,700
and everything in between

627
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,020
and bundles that are mixed

628
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,760
like people who believe that they're

629
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,740
accurate on a task but actually are low

630
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,480
accuracy

631
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,520
so it's going to be very model specific

632
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,740
I think how it Maps the different

633
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,520
people's understanding but what I was uh

634
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,740
is that was what Ali's response kind of

635
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,059
made me

636
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,340
think about and that's why I didn't

637
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,980
choose an example like delusions

638
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,600
to focus on

639
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,360
because that is related to the felt or

640
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,460
experienced

641
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,679
or reported

642
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
phenomena

643
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,220
um Okay so

644
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,740
beliefs and prayers and this question of

645
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,020
disorders of inference which as Brock

646
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,820
mentioned was like part of the early

647
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,080
impetus

648
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,539
in relating to studying for example

649
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,419
schizophrenia and

650
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:22,740
fristin's earlier

651
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,240
and continued work

652
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,899
maybe there's a part I'm missing and

653
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,700
maybe it's not the right context or way

654
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,679
but

655
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,260
um I think

656
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,039
first we can narrowly interpret what

657
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,080
they use to mean disorder and then have

658
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,639
a more broad perspective so

659
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,120
I read this does not necessarily imply

660
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,120
the inferential mechanisms flawed like

661
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,200
the CPU has the right number of Cycles

662
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,320
the Machinery are not flawed the car is

663
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,299
operating at normal burning temperature

664
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:11,159
given its generative model as specified

665
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,919
chapter four

666
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,799
it is doing appropriate variational

667
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,799
message passing belief propagation

668
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,480
approximate Bayesian computation

669
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,940
Bayesian brain however you want to see

670
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,020
it

671
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,240
given what this person has experienced

672
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,240
and their parameterization

673
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
it's not the case that they're making a

674
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,840
fallacious estimate

675
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,159
now that's sort of in the situations

676
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,480
where it's like yeah okay but you're

677
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,559
going to say that for whatever they do

678
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,419
do

679
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,100
but it's like that's kind of that

680
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,140
tautology it's like right that's our

681
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,659
best estimate of the system as it is

682
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,520
just how it is

683
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,840
in most of the studies reviewed in table

684
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,320
9.1 which is to say

685
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,840
the pathologies that are identified in

686
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,760
table 9.1

687
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,620
the inferential mechanism operates

688
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,919
normally as per the previous meaning but

689
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,440
based upon a flaw generative model

690
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,559
and it's literally like there's the rub

691
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,860
aberrant prior beliefs is like what and

692
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,980
so that is where I would say

693
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,799
there's two ways to zoom out from that

694
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,899
and contextualize that statement the

695
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,760
first is aberrant prior beliefs are not

696
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,700
intrinsically operant

697
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,799
whether they're

698
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,980
um subconsciously or consciously held I

699
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,919
believe in itself is not operant

700
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,860
but there's the niche

701
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,659
and especially just the human cultural

702
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,279
when we're talking about these felt

703
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,480
beliefs

704
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,779
so in the niche it's like there is ant

705
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,059
colonies that were high foraging and low

706
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,679
foraging

707
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,140
those are not aberrances of foraging

708
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,840
Behavior that's variation in foraging

709
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Behavior with respect to variation in

710
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
weather

711
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,960
and there was probably decades where one

712
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,779
was better than the other

713
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,739
and that's why there's evolution

714
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,540
so it's like

715
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,599
what's the per okay so level one of

716
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,659
aberrant is in a niche context

717
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,300
and then especially for these like

718
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,580
expressively

719
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,260
human

720
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,820
um experienced

721
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,980
settings

722
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,418
that's where I think there's an

723
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,980
opportunity again not saying that this

724
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,659
paragraph is the right place in this

725
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,619
textbook

726
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,320
but that's where it's important to also

727
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,520
bring in like the um like

728
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm not expert in this area but like

729
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,940
Foucault social descriptions of um

730
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,080
mental illness diagnosis

731
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,359
well they're only crazy if the majority

732
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,460
of people and something

733
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,859
this book yeah which I've mentioned on

734
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,660
live streams before if I could just

735
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,880
describe why I bring it up and like how

736
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,240
I think it's relevant to chapter nine

737
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,099
is just like

738
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,040
she's saying there's different methods

739
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
and there's different theoretical

740
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,280
interpretations

741
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,400
and it's very clear

742
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,820
and it's very

743
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,820
pluralist and though guided

744
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,960
everybody will also I think see like

745
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,260
deeper aspects too but just I studied

746
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,640
with Helen

747
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,619
in Stanford

748
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,920
and she it was just very like

749
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,140
it's very interesting to

750
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,980
see that coming from philosophy

751
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,619
because in the scientific domains it's

752
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,000
like not framed that way

753
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,220
it's like we could have a generative

754
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,859
model for these

755
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,160
conditions and scenarios

756
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,200
that integrates different types of

757
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,439
information

758
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,260
in a situational way with a sparse model

759
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,500
and we could all work on that and then

760
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,640
different people could have different

761
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,680
data sets or different public or private

762
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,220
data sets

763
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
but that requires not just sort of like

764
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
operational coordination

765
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,960
and ontology driven design and other

766
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,339
features

767
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,119
but it also requires a

768
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,400
basically personally held commitment to

769
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,940
pluralism

770
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,500
at least in practice

771
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,420
because there's too many methods and

772
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,160
methods are too

773
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,800
Last Mile

774
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,579
to

775
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,079
dictate

776
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,420
models of phenomena

777
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,859
these are not measurements

778
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,240
but they're generated alongside and with

779
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,379
and from measurements

780
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,119
and so that's not descriptive statistics

781
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,280
per se

782
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,920
and that's a major difference in this

783
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,720
what you can do with the Tail of Two

784
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,078
densities

785
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,160
approaches these situations differently

786
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,640
than one might see in a

787
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,200
Health Journal

788
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,980
showing

789
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,900
the population level factors associated

790
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,619
with a disease

791
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,720
this is a different kind of study

792
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,520
but it could be done in a population

793
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,140
context

794
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,900
which has been done extensively in SPM

795
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,920
and neuroimaging

796
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,700
so you can still bring in features of

797
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,619
the people

798
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,599
and understand how different features of

799
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,460
people are quite literally associated

800
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,680
with the diagnosis

801
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,480
and

802
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,780
that is seen as a label

803
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,440
on a neurocognitive Model A generative

804
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,520
model

805
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,579
now what's the generative model

806
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,220
chapter 4 chapter 6.

807
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,900
and then it's like okay we're just going

808
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,540
to say that all of the people's ocular

809
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,339
motor circuitry

810
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,800
are structurally the same

811
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,300
and we're going to explore how the two

812
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,980
groups differ in the parameter estimates

813
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,020
of these different features

814
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,599
or you could say I'm studying a

815
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,000
situation where this region has been

816
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,260
severed

817
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,180
so the hypothesis I'm testing is

818
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,780
actually whether this connectivity

819
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,599
versus this connectivity is going to

820
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,339
have this observable difference

821
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,339
that's testing a structural hypothesis

822
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,320
so you could test parametric hypotheses

823
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,020
within a generative model

824
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,839
and or structural hypotheses across but

825
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,579
to kind of returns at this point

826
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,040
those are these two ways that the model

827
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,220
can be quote in in their you know way

828
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,020
aberrant or flawed

829
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,520
quite literally

830
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,500
it could be a parametric

831
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,260
estimate that's aberrant

832
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,880
which as discussed does not mean

833
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,900
intrinsically bad number 4.2 or 37.3 is

834
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,660
not bad it's about its relationship

835
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,880
within a niche in a fitness context and

836
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,560
like all of that

837
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,200
so it could be a parametric

838
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,339
uh aberrance

839
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,260
with respect to a state estimator like

840
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,200
an expectation on a variable variable or

841
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,339
precision

842
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,040
so that's the LaPlace approximation

843
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,900
it's the hierarchical predictive proc

844
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,359
processing approximation

845
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,300
slash structure expectation variance

846
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,920
mean variance mode variance

847
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,480
center of the path

848
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,540
width of the path

849
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,000
those are the two gaussian

850
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,680
distribution takes two parameters

851
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,480
LaPlace approximation takes two

852
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,040
parameters

853
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,160
hierarchical message uh passing

854
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,980
has these kinds of

855
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,900
variables

856
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,400
or

857
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,760
it can be structural differences

858
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,079
which is quite open-ended

859
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,380
how is this useful

860
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,560
an example is provided

861
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,240
here

862
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,220
potentially for example let's just say

863
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,900
that there's people who do and do do not

864
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,839
have a certain situation

865
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,000
um some moths go towards the light and

866
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,440
some don't

867
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,700
is that because of differences in their

868
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,140
behavior

869
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,839
where the statistical variance

870
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,560
gets loaded onto differences in

871
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,920
their realized preference vector

872
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,460
or their habit

873
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,140
e

874
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,320
so it there could be a behavioral setup

875
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,599
that would do you know the Fibonacci

876
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,700
pattern of variability just whatever it

877
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,500
happened to be which is extensively

878
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,660
described in SPM how to time different

879
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,160
behavioral stimuli

880
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,520
some natural observational setting or

881
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,220
controlled behavioral setting both of

882
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,660
which have pros and cons

883
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,520
both quote controlled conditions in the

884
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,740
lab and natural observation they have

885
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,940
pros and cons

886
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,820
but the idea in model-based analysis is

887
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,240
that those can be the observables

888
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,859
and you may or may not control the

889
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,359
observations but at least you know what

890
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,560
they are

891
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,079
and then you can explore whether

892
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,980
differences in Behavior

893
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,740
end up being reflected

894
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,380
in statistically differentiable

895
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,020
parameter estimates

896
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,760
for

897
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,780
prior preference or for prior D or for

898
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,520
the fixed form term e

899
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,099
okay

900
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,820
Ollie

901
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:30,300
uh and yes for what it's worth I also

902
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,660
put a code from uh this recent paper by

903
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,820
Carl Preston from a couple of months ago

904
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,640
which is by the way is a great uh

905
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,619
overview of this whole field of

906
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,720
computation Psychiatry through the lens

907
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,880
of active imprints and here

908
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,220
it provides

909
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,980
a clear and explicit definition of the

910
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,500
term belief used in this area so

911
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,400
I thought

912
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,460
like that might be helpful here

913
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,339
the kind of belief beliefs here are

914
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,980
Bayesian beliefs and then it goes on to

915
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,500
describe what Bayesian beliefs mean

916
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,000
awesome

917
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,660
um

918
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,680
cool that is super clarifying

919
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,060
I think

920
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,020
um

921
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,619
it makes a lot of sense

922
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:36,000
and I I so I have uh still a kind of

923
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,500
maybe

924
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,960
I don't know if

925
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,819
the answer

926
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,819
was already given exactly or I'll just

927
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,319
ask it a different slightly different

928
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,460
way about

929
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,839
um

930
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,700
the the separation between the

931
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,579
generative model and the priors here

932
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:54,960
in

933
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,359
this toy you know frog jumping example

934
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,099
are

935
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,220
are the aberrant priors the you know the

936
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,420
Frog Apple Distribution on that belief

937
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,040
beforehand

938
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,940
and

939
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,880
the observation the updating all of that

940
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,700
being the general model is working as

941
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,180
you know intended but it's just that

942
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,920
the

943
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,420
priors were so out of whack

944
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,240
that when you know the

945
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,800
generative model kind of observes and

946
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,220
steps through or whatever that it's um

947
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,460
you know uh it just ends up in the wrong

948
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,720
State and or is is the likelihood model

949
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,660
it just I'm not sure I guess in this in

950
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,900
the toy example there how you could have

951
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,780
how it would be I guess the the parts

952
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,400
that's missing there is the context

953
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,319
maybe but um

954
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,599
yeah like if I had a prior belief that

955
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,420
was different than your prior belief but

956
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,760
we weren't you know we didn't have a

957
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,520
disorder or whatever I would imagine our

958
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,500
priors wouldn't be the same but they

959
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,560
would still kind of converge

960
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,940
um

961
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,040
so I'm not sure how you get there

962
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,020
without uh

963
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,359
an outside prior belief or something

964
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,220
about the environment that's totally

965
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,339
wrong right or like or

966
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:31,440
you know some something else about the

967
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,300
environment or the likelihood model is

968
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,440
somehow really wrong

969
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,359
yeah thanks great question those are

970
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,460
exactly the two greetings welcome back

971
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,460
Ellie those are exactly like the two let

972
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,920
me unpack that in the pathology example

973
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,599
so Society expects us and or

974
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,020
we actually die or have consequences

975
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,540
with when the Frog when it's a frog

976
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,540
you're not supposed to eat it apples are

977
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,259
okay to eat

978
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,599
now if you uh turn down too many apples

979
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,099
you starve

980
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,040
if you eat too many frogs you die

981
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,920
so you have to balance your type 1 and

982
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,960
type 2 false positive and false negative

983
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,420
error rates

984
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,020
in this eat do not eat

985
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,220
jump does not jump observation setting

986
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,040
because these aren't just these are idle

987
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,420
classifiers here but we can imagine

988
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,220
these as more action-oriented

989
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,660
classifiers

990
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,119
apples are for eating frogs are for

991
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,280
throwing

992
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,079
um

993
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,579
now society and or the niche defines

994
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,640
aberrant Behavior

995
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,180
as one that does not conform

996
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,520
to expectations or

997
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,099
to the to the um

998
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,280
to a thriving state in the niche

999
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,260
while recognizing that all parameter

1000
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,540
values that are actually observed are at

1001
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,400
least there

1002
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,960
now that doesn't mean you want them to

1003
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,520
be there they want them but also then

1004
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,560
that's a belief an agent has about

1005
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,720
another system that also exists

1006
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,859
so there would be many ways

1007
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:23,339
to see that aberrant Behavior

1008
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:26,880
so if you um like speaking to the person

1009
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,119
who discards too many apples

1010
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,980
maybe they believe that they have a

1011
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,500
strong prior on frogs

1012
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,240
0.5

1013
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,319
or their likelihood which which is also

1014
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,240
a parametric belief

1015
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,579
is different

1016
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,800
they have a different action mapping now

1017
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,359
here's the question now you put them in

1018
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,339
the lab and you have jumping and

1019
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:54,300
non-jumping frogs and apples

1020
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,420
and then you can use those experimental

1021
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,940
techniques

1022
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,500
to

1023
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,920
on a computational model

1024
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,839
narrowly to determine do they simply

1025
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,339
expect

1026
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,619
frogs to appear

1027
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,400
but they know what frogs and apples do

1028
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,500
or

1029
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,000
do they have

1030
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,760
an appropriate belief about the

1031
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,780
likelihood a priori of frogs and apples

1032
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,420
but they have an incorrect action

1033
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,099
mapping

1034
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,319
I hope I said it correctly but I think

1035
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,240
you get the picture the point is you

1036
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,819
could then use experiments

1037
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:39,180
to determine whether groups of people

1038
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,180
who had effective or ineffective

1039
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,339
Behavior

1040
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,920
and then if somebody for example

1041
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,280
had an overestimate of frogs

1042
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,960
then the message to pass is frogs are

1043
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,099
not as common as you think

1044
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,099
whereas if there was somebody with a

1045
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:06,000
variance interpretable variance

1046
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,980
here in the likelihood model difference

1047
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,220
with some other preference again keeping

1048
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,780
your mind that that's still like it's

1049
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,740
like outlier detection and

1050
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,560
attracting

1051
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,180
which isn't even necessarily A

1052
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,040
preferable thing

1053
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,380
but just pointing out just statistically

1054
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,240
this person's

1055
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,760
model would be updated by saying

1056
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,740
you know it's not known that apples can

1057
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,319
jump but actually they can't

1058
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,240
it's possible that apples jump so next

1059
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,099
time something jumps don't just throw it

1060
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,220
away

1061
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,500
and those are very different

1062
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,060
points to convey

1063
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,960
and this is a very simple example

1064
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,819
but it's helpful to think about because

1065
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,619
those are the kinds of parameters if

1066
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,240
this was your model of of um

1067
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,500
schizophrenia those would be your levers

1068
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,260
or your knobs if you had a more complex

1069
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,119
model and the models are more complex

1070
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,060
then there's a lot more Associated

1071
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,339
um you know

1072
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,500
challenge Yacht Rock

1073
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,420
oh no I was just going to say that you

1074
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,880
know yeah that was really helpful and um

1075
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,400
I don't even know

1076
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,200
it seems

1077
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,020
I mean obviously I don't I know next to

1078
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,819
nothing I guess about Psychiatry uh

1079
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,920
I don't know how you do it though

1080
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,880
without something like this I mean

1081
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,380
I guess

1082
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,319
they were doing something kind of like

1083
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:46,140
this approximately like informally

1084
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,599
to some degree in some cases but like I

1085
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,940
don't like it would seem like just

1086
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,520
guessing almost

1087
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,380
and

1088
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,280
well I don't know yeah well I I even for

1089
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,000
about

1090
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,740
schizophrenia without something like

1091
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,220
this so

1092
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,680
well to simplify a complex area

1093
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,020
there was studies that Associated either

1094
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,200
a biomolecule or a genetic variant but

1095
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,760
especially biomolecules and brain

1096
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,900
Imaging

1097
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,200
directly to a diagnosis which from a

1098
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,880
health records perspective exactly makes

1099
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,760
sense it's the data you have however

1100
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,000
this is a um

1101
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,559
unobserved model

1102
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,500
of the phenomena itself

1103
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,720
that can incorporate measurements

1104
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,780
including health records

1105
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,660
and that allows the development of an

1106
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:43,020
actual understanding of the etiology and

1107
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,180
the causation

1108
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,660
and therefore could be used to justify

1109
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,720
traditionally understood interventions

1110
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,859
or suggest different

1111
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,819
Behavior

1112
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,740
and interventions like maybe you don't

1113
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,960
just oh you're low on this just take

1114
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,339
this thing that raises it it's like

1115
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:06,319
maybe that's not exactly the move

1116
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,200
but there's more precise like affordance

1117
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,359
to do that yeah yeah including the

1118
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:13,920
counterfactuals like in a clinical

1119
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,180
setting that is going to be quite

1120
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,400
interesting all right let's just in the

1121
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,319
last minutes

1122
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,960
look to 10.

1123
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,420
Minsky

1124
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,760
active inference as a unified theory of

1125
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,460
sentient Behavior

1126
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,500
if anybody wants to do a little like

1127
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,640
Twitter thread recap on the sentient

1128
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,559
the sentience discourse over the last

1129
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,000
few weeks I'm sure we can find some

1130
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,880
funny tweets but with the sentient pong

1131
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,559
playing neurons

1132
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,520
and just wave after wave of

1133
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,400
semantic discussion about the term

1134
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,339
sentience

1135
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,200
in this chapter we wrap up active

1136
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,700
inference main theoretical points from

1137
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,020
the first part of the book chapter one

1138
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,460
through five and its practical

1139
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,680
implementations from the second part six

1140
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,319
through ten then we connect the dots

1141
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,000
we abstract away from the specific

1142
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,920
active inference models discussed in

1143
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,359
previous chapters to focus on

1144
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,700
integrative aspects of the framework

1145
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,779
benefits of active

1146
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:17,880
summary of the book 10.2 chapter 1

1147
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,140
chapter 2. chapter 3 chapter 4.

1148
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,599
5 6.

1149
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,280
7 and 8.

1150
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,140
No Love

1151
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,559
chapter nine you just read it

1152
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,720
go read it again

1153
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,680
um

1154
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,480
connecting the dots the integrative

1155
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,099
perspective on active imprints

1156
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,680
interestingly framed in terms of some

1157
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,819
early

1158
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:48,558
Dennett work

1159
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,200
a call to model the whole iguana a

1160
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,940
complete cognitive creature perhaps a

1161
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,859
simple one and an environmental Niche

1162
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,578
for it to cope with

1163
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,319
rather than

1164
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:04,759
single dimensional

1165
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,500
analyzes and measurements on a complex

1166
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,119
system

1167
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,119
just too much like a whirlwind

1168
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,440
to just measure and oh well brain

1169
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,780
regions correlated with this and this

1170
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,760
region is correlated with that

1171
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,420
those kinds of structural and um

1172
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,020
behavioral morphological any given

1173
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,680
measurement

1174
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,540
does not ever get at

1175
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,059
the underlying causal structure

1176
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,280
unless you specifically model it that

1177
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,339
way

1178
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:43,200
active inference helps with that issue

1179
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,480
by offering a first principle account of

1180
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,280
the ways in which organisms solve their

1181
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,140
adaptive problems

1182
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,359
so by Framing attention memory

1183
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,099
anticipation

1184
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,059
under common

1185
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,900
computational

1186
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,339
framings

1187
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:03,720
and a unified imperative

1188
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,400
it's possible to integrate different

1189
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,260
kinds of phenomena

1190
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,760
memory

1191
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,859
attention

1192
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,480
can be thought of as optimizing same

1193
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,960
objective

1194
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,980
10-4 predictive brains predictive minds

1195
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,880
and predictive processing

1196
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,400
kind of a provocative

1197
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,940
selection

1198
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,900
active inference creatures or their

1199
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,520
brains are probabilistic inference

1200
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,740
machines

1201
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,260
connecting to the kind of

1202
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,420

so it's a quite long chapter there's a
