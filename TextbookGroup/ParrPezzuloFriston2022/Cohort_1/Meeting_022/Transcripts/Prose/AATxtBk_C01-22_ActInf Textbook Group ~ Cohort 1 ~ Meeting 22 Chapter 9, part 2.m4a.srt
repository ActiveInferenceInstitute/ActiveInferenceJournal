1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,962
You. Hello. Thanks for all joining.

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:07,598
It's active textbook group cohort one

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:08,960
meeting 22,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,550
chapter nine on October 28.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,238
Okay, we're in the second discussion

6
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,780
on chapter nine,

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,170
model based data analysis.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,354
Would anyone like to add anything they

9
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:39,114
want or mention how the

10
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:43,854
generative model discussion from the

11
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:47,546
previous 1 hour relates

12
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:50,654
to model based data analysis? How does

13
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,800
chapter four relate to chapter nine?

14
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,320
What does chapter nine address?

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,558
What do chapters six and nine address

16
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:17,070
that chapter four doesn't?

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,170
Um, I mean, six is about

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,862
thinking about applying it in,

19
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:36,750
like, incredibly kind of simplified

20
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,340
step by step kind of way.

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,158
And nine is very specifically about

22
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,430
answering scientific questions with it

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,840
and doing that with.

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,074
This metabasian. It's like almost

25
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:01,370
nested.

26
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,400
Sort of schema of active inference.

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,188
So, I mean, that's the

28
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:22,008
through line, I guess, but I'm

29
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,030
not sure more. Than that what to say.

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,440
That's really insightful. Thank you,

31
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,320
Ali.

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,424
Yeah, actually, I would compare it to a

33
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:39,712
kind of learning how to solve

34
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:43,136
problems in, I don't know, mathematics

35
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:46,912
or other physics or other areas.

36
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:50,330
For example, in chapter four,

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,552
we acquired some necessary knowledge or

38
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:03,896
prerequisite about how

39
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,884
to think about the phenomena or the

40
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:11,596
problem we're dealing with. Chapter six

41
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:16,624
kind of outlines a roadmap a

42
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:20,384
roadmap about how exactly

43
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:23,616
we should proceed to solve that problem

44
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:26,450
in a kind of formulaic way.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,150
And chapter nine, actually,

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,760
in chapter nine, we get our hands dirty

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,156
and try to solve some

48
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:40,424
of the actual or empirical problems with

49
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,716
the tools or techniques we had learned

50
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:47,944
in chapter four and six. So in

51
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:51,284
this case, I somehow

52
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:56,572
think of chapter nine as a kind of case

53
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:59,470
of study well,

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,396
kind of case of studies or a kind of

55
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:06,192
solved problem section of this

56
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,010
textbook. And, yeah,

57
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,188
I don't know how much that captures

58
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,588
their nature. That's great.

59
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:21,264
Wow. Great thoughts. I totally

60
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:21,910
agree.

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,780
Let's look at the table of contents.

62
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,332
Chapter one, special overview.

63
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:36,852
Chapter mirror symmetry.

64
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,730
Same, but different with ten.

65
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,420
So now in the middle eight chapters,

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,532
two chapters on the low road

67
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:53,100
and the high road, helping two different

68
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,252
approaches which can be developed,

69
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,730
like in a lot more detail,

70
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,544
to approach active inference from two

71
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:07,176
fascinating and non controversial

72
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,644
starting points Bayesian inference from

73
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:14,260
the low road free energy principle

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,020
and the repeated measurement persistence

75
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,200
imperative.

76
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,520
Chapter four is the first chapter on

77
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,796
active inference. Active inference is

78
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:33,692
about the generative models that are

79
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:36,524
being specified and how they're being

80
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:40,892
computed. After just

81
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:44,752
one chapter on active inference, it goes

82
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:48,576
to the area where the most research

83
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:51,196
and modeling has been done in active

84
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:54,204
inference, which is computational

85
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,560
manalian neuroanatomy.

86
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,552
One chapter on active,

87
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,180
one chapter on the primary domain.

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,750
First half of the book,

89
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,674
second half of the book. This is the

90
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:18,154
part where you're going to be in

91
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:21,162
parallel, perhaps on your first, but

92
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,210
perhaps not on your first reading.

93
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,942
You're going to be doing playing through

94
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:30,890
these applied

95
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,230
aspects of modeling.

96
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,606
First is the recipe for designing active

97
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:39,714
inference models. In Chapter Six, as

98
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:44,050
both of you have, very nicely

99
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,540
set.

100
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,958
Then the Figure

101
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,762
4.3 Dialectic discrete Continuous

102
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:59,910
Time is revisited in two chapters

103
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,494
because it probably it's one

104
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:08,566
key difference. It's a minimum of two.

105
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:10,554
So it prevents, like any like, oh,

106
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,346
well, it has to be a PMDP. It's like,

107
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,820
well, obviously not.

108
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,274
So it keeps the space of generative

109
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:21,086
modeling open and it allows for

110
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:23,866
discussion of the very interesting topic

111
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:27,358
of hybrid active

112
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:31,470
inference nested models with continuous

113
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,134
actuators, for example, but discrete

114
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:36,930
decision making apparatus.

115
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,790
So it just is like wanting to cover

116
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,366
these two key types of models in a bit

117
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,606
more detail than was addressed in

118
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,782
Chapter Four. But this was the first

119
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,978
possible moment to address it after 4.3.

120
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:56,060
Just kidding. Maybe not.

121
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,954
Then Chapter Nine, yeah,

122
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,260
where we are now, which is just, okay,

123
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,662
you've built your pure discrete time

124
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,586
pure continuous time or hybrid

125
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:12,014
generative model. If it's a toy model,

126
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:14,366
you can just generate data and just do

127
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,586
whatever you want. Or you

128
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:21,074
might have data from sensors or real

129
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:24,642
world or however that's in the data

130
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,498
format that your generative model

131
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:29,186
expected to receive, which was part of

132
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,166
your design process, you could have

133
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:34,326
determined what structure literally the

134
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,758
data is going to be in. Is it going to

135
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:39,654
be like, yes, data can be reshaped, but

136
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:44,362
just broadly, is it like 256

137
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,002
sensors in a row of one? Or is it like

138
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:50,042
eight by eight? Just those kinds of

139
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,874
questions. So that when the data start

140
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:56,062
coming in for the experiment, whether

141
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,966
you generated the data from the

142
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:01,262
generative model or whether you're using

143
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:03,470
it in a purely recognition model

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,802
capacity on real world

145
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:10,530
data, what does it look like to

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,082
do statistical modeling with

147
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,242
these statistical models that we've been

148
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:16,900
using?

149
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,640
And then chapter ten is a review.

150
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,320
It restates what each chapter does,

151
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,790
provides some further thoughts,

152
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,734
and just summarizes the unifying

153
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,450
capacity of active inference modeling.

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,670
Then there are the appendices Ali.

155
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,386
Also one in my opinion, very interesting

156
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:57,822
section of Chapter Nine is the section

157
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,830
on models of false inference,

158
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,454
section 9.7, in which there's an

159
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:07,720
interesting definition of

160
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,878
the disorders, I mean the

161
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:15,066
mental disorders, and how we

162
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:18,922
can actually computationally model those

163
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,050
different disorders.

164
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,686
Sorry. It says that here the

165
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,774
disorder does not necessarily imply that

166
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,654
the inferential mechanism is flawed. In

167
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,634
most of the studies, the inferential

168
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:37,246
mechanism operates normally but based on

169
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,654
a flawed generative model. So that's

170
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:44,754
basically what we had learned about how

171
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,350
we can somehow

172
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,626
update our beliefs or correct our

173
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:55,906
perceptions based on either refining

174
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,974
our generative model or modifying our

175
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:01,954
generative model. Or somehow,

176
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:06,010
sometimes we can just well,

177
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,654
act upon those errors and try to reduce

178
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,378
our uncertainties. But in this case,

179
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:16,958
it's a very interesting point on the

180
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:19,870
case of computational pathologies

181
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,880
because oftentimes people ask,

182
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,722
well, what does active inference

183
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:31,778
actually explain? So I think this is

184
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:35,810
a very good example of its very

185
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,340
meaningful and significant application

186
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,814
in any sense of the word. So if we

187
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:48,246
can somehow computationally model

188
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:51,414
these kind of disorders, we'll most

189
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:53,318
probably have a much better

190
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:57,834
understanding of its origin and

191
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:02,250
the way to probable

192
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,782
treatments of those disorders and many

193
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,094
other applications can comes

194
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:13,454
to mind. But yeah, I think this part

195
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:17,680
of the chapter nine is something

196
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,102
that was not addressed quite explicitly

197
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,354
in the previous chapters and in my

198
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:26,226
opinion is the most interesting part of

199
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:29,874
this one. Great.

200
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:33,126
Awesome. Yeah. It reminds me of the

201
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:35,702
table in chapter four, or sorry,

202
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,310
chapter five with the neurotransmitters.

203
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,186
So they were still at the organ systems

204
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,194
level in chapter five. But five

205
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,346
is very much related to nine, I guess in

206
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:52,358
that sense as well, because it's

207
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,638
like, here's what dopamine does, here's

208
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:57,294
what acetylcholine does just at

209
00:12:57,332 --> 00:13:00,414
the computational model level. And then

210
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:04,046
here it's like that computational model

211
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,550
was fit, like between the phenomena,

212
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,730
like attention or policy precision or

213
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,010
however phenomena to a molecule

214
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,998
in chapter five. Here, the phenomena

215
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,254
is being connected to a real human

216
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:25,080
clinical application.

217
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,612
So it's not that we're saying or anyone

218
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,436
is saying or anything like that, that

219
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:37,120
the molecule is being directly linked

220
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,056
to this paper,

221
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,840
even if it's mentioned. The direct

222
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,900
linkage approach is people in group

223
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,536
X have more molecule,

224
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:53,780
have less molecule,

225
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,404
and even the neuroimaging approach can

226
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,400
be seen as a variant of that, which is

227
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,156
people in group X have more brain

228
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,520
activation pattern.

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,916
In computational pathology, those kinds

230
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:14,268
of biochemical measurements and

231
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,036
neuroimaging measurements can, and they

232
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:20,510
are used. However,

233
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,712
this type of computational modeling is

234
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,680
referring to parametric modeling,

235
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,984
where the parameters are related to

236
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,280
the pathology.

237
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,460
So it's not an a priori classification

238
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,020
of those with and without. And then

239
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,692
descriptive statistics showing that a

240
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:49,632
biochemical or a brain imaging pattern

241
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:52,040
are differentially expressed.

242
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,200
That's descriptive statistics. It's not

243
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,344
computational pathology. It might be

244
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,840
precision pathology,

245
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,076
but it could still be precision or big

246
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:06,696
data or however, with just like purely

247
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:09,256
doing data summaries, doing a random

248
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:13,224
forest model to diagnose. These models

249
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:17,372
have a cognitive structural hypothesis

250
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:20,640
about the nature of these phenomena,

251
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,304
like the ocular motor syndromes. Again,

252
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:25,916
it's not just people with the diagnosis

253
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:29,910
and without. It's a neurocognitive model

254
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,660
of eye behavior.

255
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,400
And then explanations

256
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,216
can be made from clinical data by

257
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:45,688
rendering various aspects of the

258
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,916
generative model conditionally

259
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,708
independent of others, ocular motor

260
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:50,740
syndrome, such as intranuclear

261
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,140
optipomilegias, may be induced.

262
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,084
So if you just were diagnosing these as

263
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,204
different conditions, maybe they have

264
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:03,224
similar ideologies how the condition

265
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,464
arises, maybe they have different,

266
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,040
maybe they have multiple.

267
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,212
But these two conditions computationally

268
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,756
can be understood as parametric

269
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:19,604
modulating in a

270
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:22,624
computational model of ocular motor

271
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:23,380
behavior.

272
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,336
This isn't people with internuclear

273
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:32,104
opto, DA, DA, DA have higher glucose or

274
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:34,232
lower glucose or this brain region or

275
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:38,104
this aspect of them, those are

276
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:41,240
all absolutely valid approaches.

277
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,664
That's like scientific methodological

278
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,804
pluralism, which is like, it's okay that

279
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,192
people want to do different approaches.

280
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:52,670
Everybody's contributing to a common

281
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,536
people who care about this and are

282
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:58,050
creating high quality reproducible data,

283
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,616
their data will always be useful and

284
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:03,056
their perspectives are valid and we

285
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:06,592
don't want to have a discourse space on

286
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:10,100
inter nuclear optipomygia that's

287
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,916
saying that one model is like simply the

288
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,470
only correct model.

289
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,800
This paper makes a positive contribution

290
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,112
and points to some new ways of

291
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,100
thinking about various

292
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,252
pathologies and

293
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:42,504
thinking beyond the ways that they've

294
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:45,310
been worked on before,

295
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,328
where one can imagine that before 2000

296
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:53,200
and so on, you had what health records.

297
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,244
And you have some double blind

298
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:58,896
experiments. And so you might do a meta

299
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,652
analysis to find correlations with

300
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,556
features of people and all of those

301
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:06,324
things that we've been describing. But

302
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:10,920
it was not plausible to

303
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,484
actually implement computational models

304
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:17,784
of these phenomena. Now,

305
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:19,128
interestingly, that's something that can

306
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:22,920
be worked on by researchers directly,

307
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,212
and then somebody can a doctor could

308
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,700
download Ocular motor syndromes

309
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,140
programming,

310
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,416
whatever it is, but this can be

311
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:41,280
developed in a pure research context.

312
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,256
And the Generative Model is like the

313
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:47,584
interface for the

314
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:51,044
kind of information that might not be

315
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:52,916
available to the person developing the

316
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:57,506
Generative Model because

317
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,842
it relates to a lot of problems and

318
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:04,530
issues about data availability.

319
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,102
That's one kind of just side note, but

320
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:13,842
dilly. Thanks for raising that point

321
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,162
that I just wanted to emphasize and

322
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:20,742
unpack, which is that this table,

323
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,614
which is taking up two and a half pages

324
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,810
of a pretty short book is describing.

325
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,630
These are like the cases that can be

326
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,678
brought up, which they're providing in a

327
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:36,794
helpful table for what active inference

328
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,442
describes. So if the principle of least

329
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:42,210
action, gauge theory, et cetera,

330
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,420
sophistication does not interest one,

331
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,100
these are more pragmatic value.

332
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,314
Now that will probably move the goalpost

333
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:56,450
to show me where the computational

334
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,670
modeling helped somebody with delusions

335
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,660
and that's a fine place to want to go.

336
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,406
But it's also a standard and an approach

337
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:14,166
that it's not related

338
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,942
to the substance of the theoretical

339
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,890
development.

340
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,284
I mean, I think you could probably the

341
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:28,724
response to that question might be.

342
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:32,390
Something like the difficulty of

343
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,984
implementing that model in a way that

344
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:42,600
provides actionable

345
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,176
real time affordances

346
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,824
to address the aberrant

347
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:56,060
priors in a way that's causally.

348
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,948
It's going to actually affect that

349
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:03,730
system. We need

350
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,432
either more compute or a particular kind

351
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,316
of algorithmic medicine that doesn't

352
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:14,324
exist yet or et cetera. But that's not

353
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:17,584
a problem with the particular approach,

354
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:21,520
it's just an insufficiency of ability

355
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,570
to enact it, I guess.

356
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,312
But I wanted to ask a question about

357
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:36,824
specifically this aberrant prior

358
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:38,508
beliefs. It says ultimately the

359
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,136
pathology is a consequence of aberrant

360
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,104
prior beliefs. It's not the Generative

361
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:43,980
Model, it's aberrant prior beliefs.

362
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,136
I think this is like Ellie's point and

363
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,704
everything that you just went through is

364
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,736
correct that this is kind of where the

365
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:59,184
rubber really meets the road for its

366
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:02,470
value in demonstrating or whatever. But

367
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,670
I'm wondering also.

368
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,180
To me that there's like an easy

369
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,496
confusion thing there about beliefs and

370
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:17,416
priors. If they just believed the

371
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:20,216
right thing. Then they wouldn't have

372
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,384
these that's not.

373
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,370
Really what that means though, right?

374
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,308
Is another way of saying this, like in

375
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,620
the Ocular motor.

376
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,444
Disorder case, like a kind

377
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:41,500
of neurobiological bias

378
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,512
in some kinds of cells or whatever,

379
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:48,972
right. That's pathologically

380
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,844
different than normal or whatever,

381
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:56,144
like some receptor

382
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:59,364
for a particular chemical or

383
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:03,108
whatever, is that a kind of thing?

384
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:06,236
That the way of saying that differently

385
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:08,650
in that particular case that is.

386
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,868
More. Commensurate with what they're

387
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:16,156
actually saying there. Or like not more

388
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:20,136
commensurate, but just not relying

389
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:23,470
on jargon and or

390
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,756
domain knowledge specific for what they

391
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:31,776
mean by beliefs and priors or is

392
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:32,850
that not right?

393
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,388
Yeah, well, there's a lot there. Are you

394
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:42,656
talking about the comparison of the

395
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:46,496
terms beliefs and priors in relationship

396
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:50,060
to the way people might naturally

397
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,904
interpret such beliefs to

398
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:58,816
be, and they may indeed be people's

399
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,724
beliefs about the world in the

400
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:02,230
conversational sense?

401
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,828
Like some beliefs are just your retinal

402
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:10,648
states but other states of the world,

403
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:14,184
as if or really are your states on other

404
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:17,210
things. Right?

405
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,328
Yeah, I guess I'm asking if beliefs

406
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:26,264
is in some cases

407
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:30,412
it is beliefs, but it's also another way

408
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:34,332
of stating if another way of stating

409
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:38,000
that is a structural

410
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,552
systemic bias for one thing or another

411
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,450
or whatever in that context, is that

412
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,460
physical or informational kind of non

413
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,856
folk psychology? Is that commensurate

414
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,710
with what they mean by beliefs there?

415
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,504
Okay, let's try to yeah, Ali, please,

416
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,330
first, sorry.

417
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,144
I'm sorry, but you mean the statistical

418
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:18,196
use of the word belief? Because in

419
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:20,580
statistics and in folk psychology,

420
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,996
as far as I know, this term is used in

421
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:28,920
quite different ways. So I

422
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,410
guess that what you're talking about is

423
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,240
the statistical sense of the word

424
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,176
belief. And if it maps onto the folk

425
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,652
psychological sense of this

426
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:46,590
term or am I missing something here?

427
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,688
Well, let's just take two steps back for

428
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:55,250
a second. And just in the text it says

429
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,856
at the bottom of page 185 here at

430
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:08,244
the top of that yeah, it says the

431
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:10,704
infertile mechanism operates normally

432
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,572
but based on a flawed generative model.

433
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,556
This means that ultimately pathology is

434
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:17,800
a consequence of aberrant prior beliefs.

435
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,064
Yeah. And I'm asking a

436
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:26,760
kind of just to explicate different

437
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,344
whatever right

438
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:33,224
there in. The context of psychological

439
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:34,952
disorders, which is not necessarily

440
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,956
pathology. But I'm just you know, if you

441
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,668
tell somebody, oh, yeah, it helps with

442
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:41,376
or is the impetus or whatever for this

443
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,890
whole thing was to think about

444
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,304
specifically like schizophrenia and

445
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,810
other but that.

446
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,956
Immediately kind of puts it in that.

447
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:57,072
Category or that context of definitions.

448
00:26:57,136 --> 00:27:01,364
And so just to kind

449
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:04,916
of. Nuance the

450
00:27:04,938 --> 00:27:06,970
term their beliefs a little bit.

451
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,944
Yeah. Is it commensurate with the rest

452
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:16,376
of the text to say in

453
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:19,608
the case of this specifically of this

454
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:23,020
oculine motor disorder category,

455
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,960
like you're saying beliefs in the retina

456
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,420
or something that is like

457
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,744
cones, like being sensitive to

458
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:34,144
something. Well, it's just what they are

459
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:36,096
sensitive to and in this particular

460
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,424
person they're just

461
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:42,652
sensitive to or whatever the relevant

462
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,248
structure is there. But it's sensitive

463
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:48,720
to something. Right. And that's

464
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,670
its belief in some sense.

465
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,688
I'm not looking for what's the

466
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,616
statistical definition or anything like

467
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,464
that, but just is that completely off

468
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:06,296
track or is. That I have a thought, but

469
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,796
Ali, if you want to make a response

470
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:08,410
please.

471
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,624
Yeah. I think that this term

472
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:17,516
belief and its different meanings in

473
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,504
different contexts actually sort

474
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:24,640
of bleed into each other and there

475
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,124
cannot possibly be separated cleanly

476
00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:33,436
from each other. So in this particular

477
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:37,300
case I believe that the word belief

478
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,576
partly is this folk

479
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:47,816
psychological sense of the word and

480
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:51,544
partly it's based on the kind

481
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:55,432
of philosophical epistemological sense

482
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:58,956
of this word. Because especially in

483
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:02,764
epistemology when philosophers talk

484
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:06,060
about belief, usually they don't mean

485
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,148
just the folk psychological sense of

486
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:12,608
this term, although it relates to that

487
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:15,456
concept, but it's much more nuanced than

488
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:19,360
that. So in the case of Oculomotor

489
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,420
pathology well, I believe that the word

490
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,772
belief somehow can be

491
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:30,740
interpreted in a little more abstract

492
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,124
philosophical sense of or

493
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:36,996
epistemological sense of this word than

494
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:40,536
our folks psychological sense of

495
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,130
it. But again,

496
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,752
I think it also has some overlappings

497
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:52,556
with the folk psychological sense of it

498
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:53,310
as well.

499
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,496
Great thought just to kind of restate

500
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:01,664
that then say what I was planning to

501
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:05,792
before. So here it's situational where

502
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,624
people talk commonly about don't talk

503
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:10,576
about beliefs like the eye, like where

504
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:12,370
it believes it should be looking,

505
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,676
people don't talk about that. But there

506
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,196
might be another cognitive model that

507
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:21,664
does align very well with an expressed

508
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:25,028
felt cognitive belief and

509
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,984
everything in between and bundles that

510
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:32,456
are mixed like people who believe that

511
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,344
they're accurate on a task but actually

512
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:37,384
are low accuracy. So it's going to be

513
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:40,264
very model specific, I think how it maps

514
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:42,152
to different people's understanding.

515
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:46,264
But that was what Ali's response

516
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,496
kind of made me think about and that's

517
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:51,584
why I didn't choose an example like

518
00:30:51,622 --> 00:30:55,536
Delusions to focus on because that is

519
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,872
related to a felt or experienced or

520
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:02,800
reported phenomena.

521
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,816
Okay, so beliefs

522
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:10,724
and priors and this question of

523
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:13,072
disorders of inference which as Brock

524
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:14,852
mentioned was like part of the early

525
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,136
impetus in relating to studying for

526
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:21,252
example, schizophrenia and fristin's

527
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:24,490
earlier and continued work.

528
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,876
Maybe there's a part of missing and

529
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:33,132
maybe it's not the right context or way,

530
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,980
but I think first

531
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,424
we can narrowly interpret what they use

532
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:43,392
to mean disorder and then have a more

533
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:48,256
broad perspective. So I

534
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:51,216
read this does not necessarily imply the

535
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:54,564
inferential mechanisms flawed. Like the

536
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:57,380
CPU has the right number of cycles,

537
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,252
the machinery are not flawed, the car is

538
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:04,820
operating at normal burning temperature.

539
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,800
Given its generative model as specified

540
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,264
hashtag chapter four it

541
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:16,868
is doing appropriate variational,

542
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:19,000
message passing, belief propagation,

543
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,432
approximate Bayesian computation,

544
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:23,836
Bayesian brain however you want to see

545
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,620
it. Given what this person has

546
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,020
experienced and their parameterization,

547
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,736
it's not the case that they're making a

548
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:34,240
fallacious estimate.

549
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,160
Now that's sort of in their situation

550
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,468
where it's like, yeah, okay, but you're

551
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:40,672
going to say that for whatever they do

552
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:44,912
do. But that's kind of that tautology.

553
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,324
It's like, right, that's our best

554
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:49,732
estimate of the system as it is is just

555
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:53,684
how it is in most

556
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,000
of the studies reviewed in Table 9.1,

557
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,524
which is to say the pathologies

558
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:02,010
that are identified in Table 9.1,

559
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,516
the inferential mechanism operates

560
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:07,364
normally as per the previous meaning,

561
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,432
but based upon a flawed generative

562
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,896
model. And it's literally like there's

563
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:15,740
the rub. Aberrant prior beliefs is like,

564
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,070
what? And so that is where I would say

565
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,736
there's two ways to zoom out from that

566
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,736
and contextualize that statement. The

567
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,768
first is aberrant. Prior beliefs are not

568
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:30,880
intrinsically aberrant, whether they're

569
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,560
subconsciously or consciously held.

570
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,540
Belief in itself is not aberrant.

571
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,508
But there's the niche and especially

572
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,168
just the human cultural when we're

573
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:46,456
talking about these felt beliefs. So in

574
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:48,792
the niche, it's like there is ant

575
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:51,064
colonies that were high foraging and low

576
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:54,472
foraging. Those are not aberrances of

577
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:57,336
foraging behavior. That's variation in

578
00:33:57,358 --> 00:33:59,356
foraging behavior with respect to

579
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:02,284
variation in weather. And there was

580
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:04,284
probably decades where one was better

581
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,868
than the other. And that's why

582
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:11,336
there's evolution. So it's

583
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:15,152
like, what's the purpose? Okay, so level

584
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:17,840
one of aberrant is in a niche context

585
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,090
and then especially for these

586
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,500
expressively human experienced

587
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,208
settings, that's where I think there's

588
00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:31,796
an opportunity, again, not saying that

589
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,428
this paragraph is the right place in

590
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:36,276
this textbook, but that's where it's

591
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,090
important to also bring in.

592
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,576
I'm not expert in this area, but like

593
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:47,864
Foucault social descriptions of

594
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:51,000
mental illness diagnosis.

595
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,110
Are only crazy if majority of people.

596
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,976
This book, which I've mentioned on live

597
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,324
streams before. If I could just describe

598
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,976
why I bring it. Up and, like, how I

599
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:12,144
think it's relevant to chapter nine is

600
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:15,812
just like she's saying there's different

601
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,844
methods and there's different

602
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,976
theoretical interpretations and it's

603
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:25,190
very clear and it's very

604
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,960
pluralist. And though guided,

605
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,024
everybody will also, I think, see like

606
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:37,236
deeper aspects too. But just I studied

607
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,984
with Helen in Stanford and

608
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:44,444
she was just very like it was very

609
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:47,804
interesting to see that coming from

610
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:51,852
philosophy because in the scientific

611
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,290
domains it's like not framed that way.

612
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,986
We could have a generative model for

613
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:04,210
these conditions and scenarios

614
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,286
that integrates different types of

615
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:10,834
information in a situational

616
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:13,814
way with the sparse model and we could

617
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,774
all work on that and then different

618
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:18,426
people could have different data sets or

619
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:20,570
different public or private data sets.

620
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,814
But that requires not just sort of like

621
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,446
operational coordination and

622
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,914
ontology driven design and other

623
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:39,706
features, but it also requires basically

624
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,330
personally held commitment to pluralism,

625
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,366
at least in practice because there's too

626
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:53,582
many methods and methods are too last

627
00:36:53,636 --> 00:37:00,270
mile to dictate

628
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,162
models of phenomena. These are not

629
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:08,142
measurements, but they're generated

630
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:09,714
alongside and with and from

631
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:10,610
measurements.

632
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,780
And so that's not descriptive statistics

633
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,884
per se and that's a major difference

634
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:24,636
in what you can do with the tail of two

635
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:30,332
densities approaches

636
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:33,840
these situations differently

637
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,072
than one might see in a health

638
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:43,444
journal showing the

639
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:46,116
population level factors associated with

640
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:46,980
a disease.

641
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,128
This is a different kind of study but it

642
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:54,680
could be done in a population context

643
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,924
which has been done extensively in SPM

644
00:37:57,972 --> 00:37:59,320
and Neuroimaging.

645
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,546
So you can still bring in features of

646
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,942
the people and understand how different

647
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,874
features of people are quite literally

648
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,070
associated with the diagnosis.

649
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,942
And that is seen as

650
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:20,990
a label on a neurocognitive

651
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,318
model, a generative model. Now what's

652
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:27,458
the generative model? Chapter Four

653
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:30,354
chapter Six and then it's like, okay,

654
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,514
we're just going to say that all of the

655
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,782
people's ocular motor circuitry are

656
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:38,438
structurally the same and we're going to

657
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:40,038
explore how the two groups differ in the

658
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:41,574
parameter estimates of these different

659
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:45,334
features. Or you could say I'm studying

660
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:48,074
a situation where this region has been

661
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:50,934
severed. So the hypothesis I'm testing

662
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:54,090
is actually whether this connectivity

663
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,566
versus this connectivity is going to

664
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:02,506
have this observable difference that's

665
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:05,678
testing a structural hypothesis. So you

666
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:08,046
could test parametric hypotheses within

667
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:11,086
a generative model and or structural

668
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,234
hypotheses across. But to kind of return

669
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:16,322
to this point those are these two ways

670
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,482
that the model can be quote in in their,

671
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:21,570
you know, way aberrant or flawed.

672
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,110
Quite literally it could be a parametric

673
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,662
estimate that's aberrant which

674
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:30,514
as discussed does not mean intrinsically

675
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:33,846
bad number 4.2 or three 7.3 is

676
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:36,566
not bad. It's about its relationship

677
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,982
within a niche and a fitness context and

678
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:41,738
like all of that. So it could be a

679
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:46,874
parametric aberrance with

680
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:49,294
respect to a state estimator like an

681
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:53,098
expectation on a variable or precision.

682
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:55,390
So that's the LaPlace approximation.

683
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,834
It's the hierarchical predictive

684
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:01,710
processing approximation structure,

685
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,358
expectation variance, mean variance,

686
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:09,358
mode variance, center of the path,

687
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:13,126
width of the path those are

688
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:16,086
the two. Gaussian distribution takes two

689
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:18,246
parameters. LaPlace approximation takes

690
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:21,510
two parameters. Hierarchical message

691
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,580
passing has these kinds of

692
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,866
variables or it can

693
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:33,514
be structural differences which is quite

694
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:34,570
open ended.

695
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,910
How is this useful?

696
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,320
An example is provided here,

697
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,086
potentially. For example, let's just say

698
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:48,766
that there's people who do and do not

699
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:50,260
have a certain situation.

700
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,162
Some moths go towards the light and some

701
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:57,746
don't. Is that because of

702
00:40:57,848 --> 00:41:01,474
differences in their behavior where

703
00:41:01,512 --> 00:41:04,786
the statistical variance gets loaded

704
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:09,170
onto differences in their realized

705
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,670
preference vector or their habit

706
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,086
e? So there could be a behavioral

707
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:21,494
setup that would do the fibonacci

708
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:23,482
pattern of variability or just whatever

709
00:41:23,536 --> 00:41:25,414
it happened to be which is extensively

710
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:27,710
described in SPM how to time different

711
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,550
behavioral stimuli,

712
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,454
some natural observational setting or

713
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:38,158
controlled behavioral setting both of

714
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,394
which have pros and cons. Both quote

715
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:42,530
controlled conditions in the lab and

716
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,018
natural observation. They have pros and

717
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:46,882
cons. But the idea in model based

718
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:49,106
analysis is that those can be the

719
00:41:49,128 --> 00:41:52,374
observables and you may or may not

720
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,006
control the observations, but at least

721
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:56,454
you know what they are. And then you can

722
00:41:56,492 --> 00:42:00,470
explore whether differences in behavior

723
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,582
end up being reflected in statistically

724
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:10,860
differentiable parameter estimates for

725
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,482
prior preference or for prior d or

726
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,840
for the fixed form term e.

727
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,010
Ali.

728
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,666
Yes. For what it's worth, I also put a

729
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:34,062
quote from this recent paper by Car

730
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:36,062
Pristen from a couple of months ago,

731
00:42:36,196 --> 00:42:38,160
which is, by the way, is a great

732
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,766
overview of this whole field of

733
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,826
computation psychiatry through the lens

734
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:46,500
of active inference. And here

735
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,374
it provides a clear and explicit

736
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:55,314
definition of the term belief used in

737
00:42:55,352 --> 00:42:58,920
this area. So I thought

738
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,640
that might be helpful here. The kind of

739
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,566
beliefs here are Bayesian beliefs. And

740
00:43:06,588 --> 00:43:08,626
then it goes on to describe what

741
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,860
Bayesian beliefs mean.

742
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,350
Awesome.

743
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,850
Um cool. That was super

744
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,344
clarifying. I think it

745
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:29,610
makes a lot of sense.

746
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,412
Maybe. I don't know if the

747
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:43,644
answer was already given exactly,

748
00:43:43,842 --> 00:43:45,628
or I'll just ask it a different,

749
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:47,310
slightly different way about.

750
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,116
The separation between the generative

751
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:55,600
model and the priors. Here in this

752
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:02,464
toy frog jumping example are

753
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:06,220
the aberrant priors, the frog apple

754
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,560
distribution on that belief beforehand,

755
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,810
and.

756
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,496
The. Observation, the updating, all of

757
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:19,784
that being the generative model is

758
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:23,160
working as intended. But it's just

759
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:27,676
that the priors were

760
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:31,630
so out of whack that when

761
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,428
the generative model

762
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:38,336
kind of observes and steps through or

763
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:43,456
whatever, that it

764
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:46,480
just ends up in the wrong state and or

765
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,480
is the likelihood model I'm not sure.

766
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,572
I guess in the toy example there. How

767
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:57,108
you could have how it would be. I guess

768
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:58,964
the part that's missing there is the

769
00:44:59,002 --> 00:45:02,564
context, maybe. But yeah, like if I had

770
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:04,184
a prior belief that was different than

771
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:08,116
your prior belief, but we didn't

772
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:10,904
have a disorder or whatever, I would

773
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,824
imagine our priors wouldn't be the same,

774
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:15,240
but they would still kind of converge.

775
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,044
So I'm not sure how you get there

776
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:23,544
without an outside prior

777
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:24,956
belief. Or something about the

778
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:26,668
environment that's totally wrong,

779
00:45:26,754 --> 00:45:30,668
right? Or something

780
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:32,176
else about the environment or the

781
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:34,192
likelihood model is somehow really

782
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:37,040
wrong. Yeah,

783
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,184
thanks. Great question. Those are

784
00:45:39,222 --> 00:45:41,396
exactly the two greetings. Welcome back.

785
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:44,548
Ali those are exactly like the two. Let

786
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:46,980
me unpack that in the pathology example.

787
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,870
So society expects us and or

788
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,340
we actually die or have consequences

789
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,668
with when the frog when it's a frog,

790
00:45:57,764 --> 00:45:59,940
you're not supposed to eat it. Apples

791
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,610
are okay to eat.

792
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,536
Now, if you turn down too many apples,

793
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,976
you starve. If you eat too many frogs,

794
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:12,940
you die. So you have to balance your

795
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,276
type one and type two false positive and

796
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:19,408
false negative error rates in this

797
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:23,596
eat, do not eat, jump, does not jump

798
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:27,216
observation setting. Because these

799
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:30,128
are idle classifiers here. But we can

800
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:32,192
imagine these as more action oriented

801
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,072
classifiers. Apples are for eating.

802
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:37,300
Frogs are for throwing.

803
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,540
Now, society and or the niche defines

804
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,392
aberrant behavior as

805
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:51,512
one that does not conform to

806
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:56,424
expectations or to

807
00:46:56,462 --> 00:46:59,612
a thriving state in the niche while

808
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,576
recognizing that all parameter values

809
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:03,660
that are actually observed are at least

810
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,636
there. Now, that doesn't mean you want

811
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:07,976
them to be there, they want them. But

812
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:10,160
also then that's a belief an agent has

813
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,880
about another system that also exists.

814
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,304
So there would be many ways to

815
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:24,324
see that aberrant behavior. So if

816
00:47:24,362 --> 00:47:27,252
you like speaking to the person who

817
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:30,836
discards too many apples, maybe they

818
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:33,224
believe that they have a strong prior on

819
00:47:33,262 --> 00:47:36,952
frogs 0.5 or

820
00:47:37,086 --> 00:47:40,328
their likelihood, which is also a

821
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:43,290
parametric belief, is different.

822
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,480
They have a different action mapping.

823
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,948
Now that here's the question. Now you

824
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:50,136
put them in the lab and you have jumping

825
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,940
and non jumping frogs and apples.

826
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,480
And then you can use those experimental

827
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,824
techniques on

828
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:05,424
a computational model narrowly to

829
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:08,876
determine do they simply expect frogs

830
00:48:08,908 --> 00:48:12,036
to appear but they know what frogs and

831
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:13,030
apples do?

832
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,548
Or do they have an

833
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:21,456
appropriate belief about the likelihood

834
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,256
a priori of frogs and apples but they

835
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:28,360
have an incorrect action mapping?

836
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,336
I hope I said it correctly, but I think

837
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:33,208
you get the picture. The point is you

838
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:37,160
could then use experiments to determine

839
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,900
whether groups of people who had

840
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:44,604
effective or ineffective behavior and

841
00:48:44,642 --> 00:48:47,976
then if somebody, for example, had an

842
00:48:48,018 --> 00:48:51,936
overestimate of frogs, then the message

843
00:48:52,038 --> 00:48:55,696
to pass is frogs are not as common as

844
00:48:55,718 --> 00:48:59,408
you think. Whereas if

845
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:02,260
there was somebody with a variance

846
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,500
interpretable variance here

847
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,548
in the likelihood model difference with

848
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:11,188
some other preference again, keeping in

849
00:49:11,194 --> 00:49:12,944
mind that that's still like it's like

850
00:49:13,002 --> 00:49:17,960
outlier detection and attracting

851
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,128
which isn't even necessarily a

852
00:49:21,134 --> 00:49:24,136
preferable thing. But just pointing out,

853
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:27,692
just statistically, this person's model

854
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:30,604
would be updated by saying it's not

855
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:32,492
known that apples can jump, but actually

856
00:49:32,546 --> 00:49:35,544
they can. It's possible that apples

857
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:37,144
jump, so next time something jumps,

858
00:49:37,192 --> 00:49:38,670
don't just throw it away.

859
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,080
And those are very different points

860
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,792
to convey and

861
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:50,370
this is a very simple example,

862
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,892
but it's helpful to think about because

863
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:55,796
those are the kinds of parameter if this

864
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:58,724
was your model of schizophrenia, those

865
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,688
would be your levers or your knobs.

866
00:50:02,864 --> 00:50:05,048
If you had a more complex model and the

867
00:50:05,054 --> 00:50:06,776
models are more complex, then there's a

868
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:11,876
lot more associated challenge.

869
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,648
Yeah, Brock. Oh, no, I was just going to

870
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:17,500
say that was really helpful.

871
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,070
I don't even know, it seems good.

872
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,496
Obviously I know next to nothing, I

873
00:50:28,518 --> 00:50:30,160
guess, about psychiatry.

874
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,944
I don't know how you do it though,

875
00:50:34,982 --> 00:50:36,690
without something like this.

876
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,884
I guess they were doing something kind

877
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:46,436
of like this approximately informally to

878
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:49,556
some degree, in some cases, but it would

879
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:52,150
seem like just guessing almost,

880
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,204
I don't know. Yeah, well, I could infer

881
00:50:59,252 --> 00:51:01,512
about schizophrenia without something

882
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:04,888
like this. Well,

883
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:08,332
to simplify a complex area, there was

884
00:51:08,386 --> 00:51:10,316
studies that associated either a

885
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:13,164
biomolecule or a genetic variant, but

886
00:51:13,202 --> 00:51:15,580
especially biomolecules in brain imaging

887
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,008
directly to a diagnosis which from a

888
00:51:19,014 --> 00:51:20,784
health record perspective exactly makes

889
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:23,090
sense. It's the data you have. However,

890
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,570
this is an unobserved model

891
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,212
of. The phenomena itself that can

892
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:34,336
incorporate measurements, including

893
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:38,084
health records, and that allows the

894
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:40,720
development of an actual understanding

895
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,768
of the ethiology and the causation and

896
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:48,772
therefore could be used to justify

897
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,108
traditionally understood interventions

898
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:56,360
or suggest different behavior

899
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,708
and interventions like maybe you don't

900
00:51:58,724 --> 00:52:00,924
just, oh, you're low on this, just take

901
00:52:00,962 --> 00:52:02,396
this thing that raises it. It's like

902
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:04,670
maybe that's not exactly the. Move,

903
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,196
but just more precise affordance

904
00:52:10,248 --> 00:52:12,304
to do that. Yeah, including the

905
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:13,916
counterfactuals, like in a clinical

906
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:15,440
setting that is going to be quite

907
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,136
interesting. All right, let's just in

908
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:23,200
the last minutes look to Ten Minsky

909
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,596
active inference as a unified theory of

910
00:52:26,618 --> 00:52:30,180
sentient behavior. If anybody

911
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,304
wants to do a little like Twitter thread

912
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,736
recap on the sentient the

913
00:52:35,758 --> 00:52:37,736
sentience discourse over the last few

914
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:39,364
weeks, I'm sure we can find some funny

915
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:41,924
tweets, but with the sentient pong

916
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:46,180
playing neurons and just wave after wave

917
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,184
of semantic discussion about the

918
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:54,184
term sentient. In this chapter

919
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:55,676
we wrap up active inference main

920
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:57,116
theoretical points from the first part

921
00:52:57,138 --> 00:52:58,492
of the book, chapter one through five,

922
00:52:58,546 --> 00:53:00,396
and its practical implementations from

923
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:02,736
the second part six through ten. Then we

924
00:53:02,758 --> 00:53:05,408
connect the dots. We abstract away from

925
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:07,116
the specific active inference models

926
00:53:07,148 --> 00:53:08,960
discussed in previous chapters to focus

927
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,280
on integrative aspects of the framework

928
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,010
benefits of activ.

929
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,100
Summary of the book 10.2, chapter one,

930
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:25,000
chapter two, chapter three, chapter 4567

931
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,596
and eight, no love chapter

932
00:53:28,628 --> 00:53:32,296
nine. You just read it. Go read it

933
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,684
again. Connecting the dots.

934
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,476
The integrative perspective on active

935
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:38,280
inference,

936
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,624
interestingly framed in terms of some

937
00:53:43,662 --> 00:53:46,810
early dennett work.

938
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,076
A call to model the whole iguana a

939
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:53,868
complete cognitive creature, perhaps a

940
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:55,768
simple one, and an environmental niche

941
00:53:55,784 --> 00:54:00,110
for it to cope with rather than

942
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,964
single dimensional analyses

943
00:54:06,012 --> 00:54:08,210
and measurements on a complex system

944
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,800
just too much like a Whirlwind to

945
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,144
just measure and oh, well,

946
00:54:16,182 --> 00:54:18,484
brain regions correlated with this and

947
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:20,390
this region is correlated with that.

948
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,270
Those kinds of structural and

949
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,992
behavioral, morphological any given

950
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:31,784
measurement does not

951
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,884
ever get at the underlying causal

952
00:54:34,932 --> 00:54:37,720
structure unless you specifically model

953
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:38,730
it that way.

954
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,004
Active inference helps with that issue

955
00:54:43,202 --> 00:54:45,356
by offering a first principle account of

956
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:47,164
the ways in which organisms solve their

957
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:50,152
adaptive problems. So by framing

958
00:54:50,216 --> 00:54:53,568
attention, memory, anticipation under

959
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:57,280
common computational

960
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,160
framings and a unified imperative

961
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,412
it's possible to integrate different

962
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:09,700
kinds of phenomena. Memory attention

963
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,404
can be thought of as optimizing the same

964
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,300
objective.

965
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,556
Ten four predictive brains, predictive

966
00:55:19,588 --> 00:55:21,240
minds and predictive processing.

967
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,480
Kind of a provocative selection.

968
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,916
Active inference creatures, or their

969
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:35,544
brains are probabilistic inference

970
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:39,790

Lord of the Rings, we are confident that

1004
00:57:26,354 --> 00:57:27,816
you will continue to pursue active

1005
00:57:27,848 --> 00:57:29,230
inference in some form.

1006
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,884
So it's a quite long chap. There's a lot

1007
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:38,676
in it. We'll talk about it

1008
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:41,540
next time. Thank you, fellas.
