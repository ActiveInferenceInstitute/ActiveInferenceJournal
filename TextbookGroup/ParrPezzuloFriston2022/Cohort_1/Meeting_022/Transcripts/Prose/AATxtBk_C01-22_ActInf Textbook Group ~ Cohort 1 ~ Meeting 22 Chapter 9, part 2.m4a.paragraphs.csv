650	13550	1	A	0.66803	00:00	19	You. Hello. Thanks for all joining. It's active textbook group cohort one meeting 22, chapter nine on October 28.
16750	29170	2	B	0.99	00:16	13	Okay, we're in the second discussion on chapter nine, model based data analysis.
32430	52800	3	B	0.62706	00:32	34	Would anyone like to add anything they want or mention how the generative model discussion from the previous 1 hour relates to model based data analysis? How does chapter four relate to chapter nine?
67330	70320	4	B	0.99838	01:07	5	What does chapter nine address?
72530	77070	5	B	0.99953	01:12	11	What do chapters six and nine address that chapter four doesn't?
84810	112840	6	A	0.40854	01:24	37	Um, I mean, six is about thinking about applying it in, like, incredibly kind of simplified step by step kind of way. And nine is very specifically about answering scientific questions with it and doing that with.
116170	121370	7	C	0.99719	01:56	6	This metabasian. It's like almost nested.
124460	148320	8	A	0.72502	02:04	31	Sort of schema of active inference. So, I mean, that's the through line, I guess, but I'm not sure more. Than that what to say. That's really insightful. Thank you, Ali.
151540	247100	9	D	1.0	02:31	145	Yeah, actually, I would compare it to a kind of learning how to solve problems in, I don't know, mathematics or other physics or other areas. For example, in chapter four, we acquired some necessary knowledge or prerequisite about how to think about the phenomena or the problem we're dealing with. Chapter six kind of outlines a roadmap a roadmap about how exactly we should proceed to solve that problem in a kind of formulaic way. And chapter nine, actually, in chapter nine, we get our hands dirty and try to solve some of the actual or empirical problems with the tools or techniques we had learned in chapter four and six. So in this case, I somehow think of chapter nine as a kind of case of study well, kind of case of studies or a kind of solved problem section of this textbook.
247260	261910	10	D	0.99	04:07	19	And, yeah, I don't know how much that captures their nature. That's great. Wow. Great thoughts. I totally agree.
265240	267780	11	B	0.99544	04:25	7	Let's look at the table of contents.
270220	320200	12	B	0.63597	04:30	70	Chapter one, special overview. Chapter mirror symmetry. Same, but different with ten. So now in the middle eight chapters, two chapters on the low road and the high road, helping two different approaches which can be developed, like in a lot more detail, to approach active inference from two fascinating and non controversial starting points Bayesian inference from the low road free energy principle and the repeated measurement persistence imperative.
324780	337420	13	B	0.81692	05:24	25	Chapter four is the first chapter on active inference. Active inference is about the generative models that are being specified and how they're being computed.
339760	364180	14	B	0.99998	05:39	39	After just one chapter on active inference, it goes to the area where the most research and modeling has been done in active inference, which is computational manalian neuroanatomy. One chapter on active, one chapter on the primary domain.
366200	405540	15	B	1.0	06:06	64	First half of the book, second half of the book. This is the part where you're going to be in parallel, perhaps on your first, but perhaps not on your first reading. You're going to be doing playing through these applied aspects of modeling. First is the recipe for designing active inference models. In Chapter Six, as both of you have, very nicely set.
408070	456930	16	B	1.0	06:48	79	Then the Figure 4.3 Dialectic discrete Continuous Time is revisited in two chapters because it probably it's one key difference. It's a minimum of two. So it prevents, like any like, oh, well, it has to be a PMDP. It's like, well, obviously not. So it keeps the space of generative modeling open and it allows for discussion of the very interesting topic of hybrid active inference nested models with continuous actuators, for example, but discrete decision making apparatus.
460070	489920	17	B	0.99989	07:40	66	So it just is like wanting to cover these two key types of models in a bit more detail than was addressed in Chapter Four. But this was the first possible moment to address it after 4.3. Just kidding. Maybe not. Then Chapter Nine, yeah, where we are now, which is just, okay, you've built your pure discrete time pure continuous time or hybrid generative model.
490690	530700	18	B	0.99997	08:10	97	If it's a toy model, you can just generate data and just do whatever you want. Or you might have data from sensors or real world or however that's in the data format that your generative model expected to receive, which was part of your design process, you could have determined what structure literally the data is going to be in. Is it going to be like, yes, data can be reshaped, but just broadly, is it like 256 sensors in a row of one? Or is it like eight by eight? Just those kinds of questions.
531390	556900	19	B	0.91412	08:51	52	So that when the data start coming in for the experiment, whether you generated the data from the generative model or whether you're using it in a purely recognition model capacity on real world data, what does it look like to do statistical modeling with these statistical models that we've been using?
558970	577450	20	B	0.92	09:18	27	And then chapter ten is a review. It restates what each chapter does, provides some further thoughts, and just summarizes the unifying capacity of active inference modeling.
582500	588670	21	B	0.98	09:42	6	Then there are the appendices Ali.
591190	658790	22	D	0.67524	09:51	110	Also one in my opinion, very interesting section of Chapter Nine is the section on models of false inference, section 9.7, in which there's an interesting definition of the disorders, I mean the mental disorders, and how we can actually computationally model those different disorders. Sorry. It says that here the disorder does not necessarily imply that the inferential mechanism is flawed. In most of the studies, the inferential mechanism operates normally but based on a flawed generative model. So that's basically what we had learned about how we can somehow update our beliefs or correct our perceptions based on either refining our generative model or modifying our generative model.
658860	747060	23	D	1.0	10:58	138	Or somehow, sometimes we can just well, act upon those errors and try to reduce our uncertainties. But in this case, it's a very interesting point on the case of computational pathologies because oftentimes people ask, well, what does active inference actually explain? So I think this is a very good example of its very meaningful and significant application in any sense of the word. So if we can somehow computationally model these kind of disorders, we'll most probably have a much better understanding of its origin and the way to probable treatments of those disorders and many other applications can comes to mind. But yeah, I think this part of the chapter nine is something that was not addressed quite explicitly in the previous chapters and in my opinion is the most interesting part of this one.
749270	763560	24	B	0.99997	12:29	31	Great. Awesome. Yeah. It reminds me of the table in chapter four, or sorry, chapter five with the neurotransmitters. So they were still at the organ systems level in chapter five.
764350	805080	25	B	0.98248	12:44	72	But five is very much related to nine, I guess in that sense as well, because it's like, here's what dopamine does, here's what acetylcholine does just at the computational model level. And then here it's like that computational model was fit, like between the phenomena, like attention or policy precision or however phenomena to a molecule in chapter five. Here, the phenomena is being connected to a real human clinical application.
808800	844520	26	B	0.99989	13:28	67	So it's not that we're saying or anyone is saying or anything like that, that the molecule is being directly linked to this paper, even if it's mentioned. The direct linkage approach is people in group X have more molecule, have less molecule, and even the neuroimaging approach can be seen as a variant of that, which is people in group X have more brain activation pattern.
847500	895268	27	B	0.99988	14:07	66	In computational pathology, those kinds of biochemical measurements and neuroimaging measurements can, and they are used. However, this type of computational modeling is referring to parametric modeling, where the parameters are related to the pathology. So it's not an a priori classification of those with and without. And then descriptive statistics showing that a biochemical or a brain imaging pattern are differentially expressed. That's descriptive statistics.
895444	932660	28	B	0.77438	14:55	69	It's not computational pathology. It might be precision pathology, but it could still be precision or big data or however, with just like purely doing data summaries, doing a random forest model to diagnose. These models have a cognitive structural hypothesis about the nature of these phenomena, like the ocular motor syndromes. Again, it's not just people with the diagnosis and without. It's a neurocognitive model of eye behavior.
934920	983380	29	B	1.0	15:34	77	And then explanations can be made from clinical data by rendering various aspects of the generative model conditionally independent of others, ocular motor syndrome, such as intranuclear optipomilegias, may be induced. So if you just were diagnosing these as different conditions, maybe they have similar ideologies how the condition arises, maybe they have different, maybe they have multiple. But these two conditions computationally can be understood as parametric modulating in a computational model of ocular motor behavior.
986120	1040470	30	B	0.91905	16:26	100	This isn't people with internuclear opto, DA, DA, DA have higher glucose or lower glucose or this brain region or this aspect of them, those are all absolutely valid approaches. That's like scientific methodological pluralism, which is like, it's okay that people want to do different approaches. Everybody's contributing to a common people who care about this and are creating high quality reproducible data, their data will always be useful and their perspectives are valid and we don't want to have a discourse space on inter nuclear optipomygia that's saying that one model is like simply the only correct model.
1042780	1121280	31	B	0.98981	17:22	124	This paper makes a positive contribution and points to some new ways of thinking about various pathologies and thinking beyond the ways that they've been worked on before, where one can imagine that before 2000 and so on, you had what health records. And you have some double blind experiments. And so you might do a meta analysis to find correlations with features of people and all of those things that we've been describing. But it was not plausible to actually implement computational models of these phenomena. Now, interestingly, that's something that can be worked on by researchers directly, and then somebody can a doctor could download Ocular motor syndromes programming, whatever it is, but this can be developed in a pure research context.
1122100	1144530	32	B	1.0	18:42	38	And the Generative Model is like the interface for the kind of information that might not be available to the person developing the Generative Model because it relates to a lot of problems and issues about data availability.
1148470	1166810	33	B	0.95281	19:08	43	That's one kind of just side note, but dilly. Thanks for raising that point that I just wanted to emphasize and unpack, which is that this table, which is taking up two and a half pages of a pretty short book is describing.
1169090	1216890	34	B	0.99997	19:29	89	These are like the cases that can be brought up, which they're providing in a helpful table for what active inference describes. So if the principle of least action, gauge theory, et cetera, sophistication does not interest one, these are more pragmatic value. Now that will probably move the goalpost to show me where the computational modeling helped somebody with delusions and that's a fine place to want to go. But it's also a standard and an approach that it's not related to the substance of the theoretical development.
1223400	1284570	35	A	0.84	20:23	87	I mean, I think you could probably the response to that question might be. Something like the difficulty of implementing that model in a way that provides actionable real time affordances to address the aberrant priors in a way that's causally. It's going to actually affect that system. We need either more compute or a particular kind of algorithmic medicine that doesn't exist yet or et cetera. But that's not a problem with the particular approach, it's just an insufficiency of ability to enact it, I guess.
1286300	1303980	36	C	0.7612	21:26	34	But I wanted to ask a question about specifically this aberrant prior beliefs. It says ultimately the pathology is a consequence of aberrant prior beliefs. It's not the Generative Model, it's aberrant prior beliefs.
1307360	1334200	37	C	0.99	21:47	53	I think this is like Ellie's point and everything that you just went through is correct that this is kind of where the rubber really meets the road for its value in demonstrating or whatever. But I'm wondering also. To me that there's like an easy confusion thing there about beliefs and priors.
1336220	1365168	38	C	0.96976	22:16	47	If they just believed the right thing. Then they wouldn't have these that's not. Really what that means though, right? Is another way of saying this, like in the Ocular motor. Disorder case, like a kind of neurobiological bias in some kinds of cells or whatever, right.
1365334	1388650	39	C	0.99919	22:45	35	That's pathologically different than normal or whatever, like some receptor for a particular chemical or whatever, is that a kind of thing? That the way of saying that differently in that particular case that is.
1391420	1412850	40	D	0.95	23:11	37	More. Commensurate with what they're actually saying there. Or like not more commensurate, but just not relying on jargon and or domain knowledge specific for what they mean by beliefs and priors or is that not right?
1415920	1442230	41	B	0.61	23:35	45	Yeah, well, there's a lot there. Are you talking about the comparison of the terms beliefs and priors in relationship to the way people might naturally interpret such beliefs to be, and they may indeed be people's beliefs about the world in the conversational sense?
1444360	1501710	42	B	0.96684	24:04	87	Like some beliefs are just your retinal states but other states of the world, as if or really are your states on other things. Right? Yeah, I guess I'm asking if beliefs is in some cases it is beliefs, but it's also another way of stating if another way of stating that is a structural systemic bias for one thing or another or whatever in that context, is that physical or informational kind of non folk psychology? Is that commensurate with what they mean by beliefs there?
1504640	1546590	43	B	0.66	25:04	75	Okay, let's try to yeah, Ali, please, first, sorry. I'm sorry, but you mean the statistical use of the word belief? Because in statistics and in folk psychology, as far as I know, this term is used in quite different ways. So I guess that what you're talking about is the statistical sense of the word belief. And if it maps onto the folk psychological sense of this term or am I missing something here?
1550000	1591564	44	A	0.92988	25:50	71	Well, let's just take two steps back for a second. And just in the text it says at the bottom of page 185 here at the top of that yeah, it says the infertile mechanism operates normally but based on a flawed generative model. This means that ultimately pathology is a consequence of aberrant prior beliefs. Yeah. And I'm asking a kind of just to explicate different whatever right there in.
1591602	1621990	45	A	1.0	26:31	64	The context of psychological disorders, which is not necessarily pathology. But I'm just you know, if you tell somebody, oh, yeah, it helps with or is the impetus or whatever for this whole thing was to think about specifically like schizophrenia and other but that. Immediately kind of puts it in that. Category or that context of definitions. And so just to kind of.
1624040	1667108	46	A	0.99315	27:04	79	Nuance the term their beliefs a little bit. Yeah. Is it commensurate with the rest of the text to say in the case of this specifically of this oculine motor disorder category, like you're saying beliefs in the retina or something that is like cones, like being sensitive to something. Well, it's just what they are sensitive to and in this particular person they're just sensitive to or whatever the relevant structure is there. But it's sensitive to something.
1667274	1671670	47	C	0.98358	27:47	8	Right. And that's its belief in some sense.
1674920	1688410	48	C	0.98714	27:54	36	I'm not looking for what's the statistical definition or anything like that, but just is that completely off track or is. That I have a thought, but Ali, if you want to make a response please.
1690620	1781130	49	D	0.93	28:10	138	Yeah. I think that this term belief and its different meanings in different contexts actually sort of bleed into each other and there cannot possibly be separated cleanly from each other. So in this particular case I believe that the word belief partly is this folk psychological sense of the word and partly it's based on the kind of philosophical epistemological sense of this word. Because especially in epistemology when philosophers talk about belief, usually they don't mean just the folk psychological sense of this term, although it relates to that concept, but it's much more nuanced than that. So in the case of Oculomotor pathology well, I believe that the word belief somehow can be interpreted in a little more abstract philosophical sense of or epistemological sense of this word than our folks psychological sense of it.
1782540	1793310	50	D	0.984	29:42	18	But again, I think it also has some overlappings with the folk psychological sense of it as well.
1795920	1862800	51	B	0.99334	29:55	141	Great thought just to kind of restate that then say what I was planning to before. So here it's situational where people talk commonly about don't talk about beliefs like the eye, like where it believes it should be looking, people don't talk about that. But there might be another cognitive model that does align very well with an expressed felt cognitive belief and everything in between and bundles that are mixed like people who believe that they're accurate on a task but actually are low accuracy. So it's going to be very model specific, I think how it maps to different people's understanding. But that was what Ali's response kind of made me think about and that's why I didn't choose an example like Delusions to focus on because that is related to a felt or experienced or reported phenomena.
1865060	1884490	52	B	0.65	31:05	36	Okay, so beliefs and priors and this question of disorders of inference which as Brock mentioned was like part of the early impetus in relating to studying for example, schizophrenia and fristin's earlier and continued work.
1888320	1954240	53	B	0.91571	31:28	118	Maybe there's a part of missing and maybe it's not the right context or way, but I think first we can narrowly interpret what they use to mean disorder and then have a more broad perspective. So I read this does not necessarily imply the inferential mechanisms flawed. Like the CPU has the right number of cycles, the machinery are not flawed, the car is operating at normal burning temperature. Given its generative model as specified hashtag chapter four it is doing appropriate variational, message passing, belief propagation, approximate Bayesian computation, Bayesian brain however you want to see it. Given what this person has experienced and their parameterization, it's not the case that they're making a fallacious estimate.
1955860	1996332	54	B	1.0	32:35	98	Now that's sort of in their situation where it's like, yeah, okay, but you're going to say that for whatever they do do. But that's kind of that tautology. It's like, right, that's our best estimate of the system as it is is just how it is in most of the studies reviewed in Table 9.1, which is to say the pathologies that are identified in Table 9.1, the inferential mechanism operates normally as per the previous meaning, but based upon a flawed generative model. And it's literally like there's the rub. Aberrant prior beliefs is like, what?
1996466	2025296	55	B	0.91	33:16	59	And so that is where I would say there's two ways to zoom out from that and contextualize that statement. The first is aberrant. Prior beliefs are not intrinsically aberrant, whether they're subconsciously or consciously held. Belief in itself is not aberrant. But there's the niche and especially just the human cultural when we're talking about these felt beliefs.
2025488	2049100	56	B	0.99986	33:45	52	So in the niche, it's like there is ant colonies that were high foraging and low foraging. Those are not aberrances of foraging behavior. That's variation in foraging behavior with respect to variation in weather. And there was probably decades where one was better than the other. And that's why there's evolution.
2050720	2078090	57	B	0.79213	34:10	55	So it's like, what's the purpose? Okay, so level one of aberrant is in a niche context and then especially for these expressively human experienced settings, that's where I think there's an opportunity, again, not saying that this paragraph is the right place in this textbook, but that's where it's important to also bring in.
2081660	2091000	58	B	0.99711	34:41	15	I'm not expert in this area, but like Foucault social descriptions of mental illness diagnosis.
2095260	2098110	59	A	0.95111	34:55	7	Are only crazy if majority of people.
2101920	2154290	60	B	0.9995	35:01	98	This book, which I've mentioned on live streams before. If I could just describe why I bring it. Up and, like, how I think it's relevant to chapter nine is just like she's saying there's different methods and there's different theoretical interpretations and it's very clear and it's very pluralist. And though guided, everybody will also, I think, see like deeper aspects too. But just I studied with Helen in Stanford and she was just very like it was very interesting to see that coming from philosophy because in the scientific domains it's like not framed that way.
2158230	2180570	61	B	0.99977	35:58	48	We could have a generative model for these conditions and scenarios that integrates different types of information in a situational way with the sparse model and we could all work on that and then different people could have different data sets or different public or private data sets.
2184890	2230610	62	B	0.98587	36:24	60	But that requires not just sort of like operational coordination and ontology driven design and other features, but it also requires basically personally held commitment to pluralism, at least in practice because there's too many methods and methods are too last mile to dictate models of phenomena. These are not measurements, but they're generated alongside and with and from measurements.
2233820	2279320	63	B	0.99	37:13	70	And so that's not descriptive statistics per se and that's a major difference in what you can do with the tail of two densities approaches these situations differently than one might see in a health journal showing the population level factors associated with a disease. This is a different kind of study but it could be done in a population context which has been done extensively in SPM and Neuroimaging.
2283310	2328998	64	B	0.99913	38:03	101	So you can still bring in features of the people and understand how different features of people are quite literally associated with the diagnosis. And that is seen as a label on a neurocognitive model, a generative model. Now what's the generative model? Chapter Four chapter Six and then it's like, okay, we're just going to say that all of the people's ocular motor circuitry are structurally the same and we're going to explore how the two groups differ in the parameter estimates of these different features. Or you could say I'm studying a situation where this region has been severed.
2329174	2380220	65	B	0.99971	38:49	110	So the hypothesis I'm testing is actually whether this connectivity versus this connectivity is going to have this observable difference that's testing a structural hypothesis. So you could test parametric hypotheses within a generative model and or structural hypotheses across. But to kind of return to this point those are these two ways that the model can be quote in in their, you know, way aberrant or flawed. Quite literally it could be a parametric estimate that's aberrant which as discussed does not mean intrinsically bad number 4.2 or three 7.3 is not bad. It's about its relationship within a niche and a fitness context and like all of that.
2380590	2419270	66	B	0.99992	39:40	61	So it could be a parametric aberrance with respect to a state estimator like an expectation on a variable or precision. So that's the LaPlace approximation. It's the hierarchical predictive processing approximation structure, expectation variance, mean variance, mode variance, center of the path, width of the path those are the two. Gaussian distribution takes two parameters. LaPlace approximation takes two parameters.
2420090	2434570	67	B	0.53562	40:20	19	Hierarchical message passing has these kinds of variables or it can be structural differences which is quite open ended.
2437490	2438910	68	B	0.99997	40:37	4	How is this useful?
2440930	2499486	69	B	0.99	40:40	106	An example is provided here, potentially. For example, let's just say that there's people who do and do not have a certain situation. Some moths go towards the light and some don't. Is that because of differences in their behavior where the statistical variance gets loaded onto differences in their realized preference vector or their habit e? So there could be a behavioral setup that would do the fibonacci pattern of variability or just whatever it happened to be which is extensively described in SPM how to time different behavioral stimuli, some natural observational setting or controlled behavioral setting both of which have pros and cons.
2499668	2537840	70	B	0.99973	41:39	78	Both quote controlled conditions in the lab and natural observation. They have pros and cons. But the idea in model based analysis is that those can be the observables and you may or may not control the observations, but at least you know what they are. And then you can explore whether differences in behavior end up being reflected in statistically differentiable parameter estimates for prior preference or for prior d or for the fixed form term e.
2543070	2544010	71	B	0.77323	42:23	1	Ali.
2547710	2586354	72	D	1.0	42:27	78	Yes. For what it's worth, I also put a quote from this recent paper by Car Pristen from a couple of months ago, which is, by the way, is a great overview of this whole field of computation psychiatry through the lens of active inference. And here it provides a clear and explicit definition of the term belief used in this area. So I thought that might be helpful here. The kind of beliefs here are Bayesian beliefs.
2586402	2590860	73	D	1.0	43:06	11	And then it goes on to describe what Bayesian beliefs mean.
2594600	2595350	74	B	0.99968	43:14	1	Awesome.
2600120	2609610	75	A	0.56619	43:20	14	Um cool. That was super clarifying. I think it makes a lot of sense.
2616000	2651810	76	A	0.99635	43:36	51	Maybe. I don't know if the answer was already given exactly, or I'll just ask it a different, slightly different way about. The separation between the generative model and the priors. Here in this toy frog jumping example are the aberrant priors, the frog apple distribution on that belief beforehand, and.
2654780	2696132	77	A	0.82	44:14	72	The. Observation, the updating, all of that being the generative model is working as intended. But it's just that the priors were so out of whack that when the generative model kind of observes and steps through or whatever, that it just ends up in the wrong state and or is the likelihood model I'm not sure. I guess in the toy example there. How you could have how it would be.
2696266	2715240	78	A	0.8	44:56	51	I guess the part that's missing there is the context, maybe. But yeah, like if I had a prior belief that was different than your prior belief, but we didn't have a disorder or whatever, I would imagine our priors wouldn't be the same, but they would still kind of converge.
2718160	2738544	79	A	0.99225	45:18	40	So I'm not sure how you get there without an outside prior belief. Or something about the environment that's totally wrong, right? Or something else about the environment or the likelihood model is somehow really wrong. Yeah, thanks. Great question.
2738662	2759288	80	B	0.99996	45:38	49	Those are exactly the two greetings. Welcome back. Ali those are exactly like the two. Let me unpack that in the pathology example. So society expects us and or we actually die or have consequences with when the frog when it's a frog, you're not supposed to eat it.
2759374	2789504	81	B	0.99992	45:59	59	Apples are okay to eat. Now, if you turn down too many apples, you starve. If you eat too many frogs, you die. So you have to balance your type one and type two false positive and false negative error rates in this eat, do not eat, jump, does not jump observation setting. Because these are idle classifiers here.
2789622	2797300	82	B	0.99998	46:29	18	But we can imagine these as more action oriented classifiers. Apples are for eating. Frogs are for throwing.
2800120	2832880	83	B	1.0	46:40	67	Now, society and or the niche defines aberrant behavior as one that does not conform to expectations or to a thriving state in the niche while recognizing that all parameter values that are actually observed are at least there. Now, that doesn't mean you want them to be there, they want them. But also then that's a belief an agent has about another system that also exists.
2835700	2872940	84	B	0.999	47:15	75	So there would be many ways to see that aberrant behavior. So if you like speaking to the person who discards too many apples, maybe they believe that they have a strong prior on frogs 0.5 or their likelihood, which is also a parametric belief, is different. They have a different action mapping. Now that here's the question. Now you put them in the lab and you have jumping and non jumping frogs and apples.
2874320	2962490	85	B	0.96	47:54	152	And then you can use those experimental techniques on a computational model narrowly to determine do they simply expect frogs to appear but they know what frogs and apples do? Or do they have an appropriate belief about the likelihood a priori of frogs and apples but they have an incorrect action mapping? I hope I said it correctly, but I think you get the picture. The point is you could then use experiments to determine whether groups of people who had effective or ineffective behavior and then if somebody, for example, had an overestimate of frogs, then the message to pass is frogs are not as common as you think. Whereas if there was somebody with a variance interpretable variance here in the likelihood model difference with some other preference again, keeping in mind that that's still like it's like outlier detection and attracting which isn't even necessarily a preferable thing.
2962940	3012840	86	B	0.99781	49:22	105	But just pointing out, just statistically, this person's model would be updated by saying it's not known that apples can jump, but actually they can. It's possible that apples jump, so next time something jumps, don't just throw it away. And those are very different points to convey and this is a very simple example, but it's helpful to think about because those are the kinds of parameter if this was your model of schizophrenia, those would be your levers or your knobs. If you had a more complex model and the models are more complex, then there's a lot more associated challenge. Yeah, Brock.
3013500	3017500	87	A	0.44	50:13	12	Oh, no, I was just going to say that was really helpful.
3021040	3030160	88	A	0.7	50:21	17	I don't even know, it seems good. Obviously I know next to nothing, I guess, about psychiatry.
3033060	3036690	89	C	0.59	50:33	12	I don't know how you do it though, without something like this.
3039220	3088944	90	C	0.97	50:39	89	I guess they were doing something kind of like this approximately informally to some degree, in some cases, but it would seem like just guessing almost, I don't know. Yeah, well, I could infer about schizophrenia without something like this. Well, to simplify a complex area, there was studies that associated either a biomolecule or a genetic variant, but especially biomolecules in brain imaging directly to a diagnosis which from a health record perspective exactly makes sense. It's the data you have. However, this is an unobserved model of.
3088982	3147700	91	B	1.0	51:28	111	The phenomena itself that can incorporate measurements, including health records, and that allows the development of an actual understanding of the ethiology and the causation and therefore could be used to justify traditionally understood interventions or suggest different behavior and interventions like maybe you don't just, oh, you're low on this, just take this thing that raises it. It's like maybe that's not exactly the. Move, but just more precise affordance to do that. Yeah, including the counterfactuals, like in a clinical setting that is going to be quite interesting. All right, let's just in the last minutes look to Ten Minsky active inference as a unified theory of sentient behavior.
3149480	3209208	92	B	0.99993	52:29	130	If anybody wants to do a little like Twitter thread recap on the sentient the sentience discourse over the last few weeks, I'm sure we can find some funny tweets, but with the sentient pong playing neurons and just wave after wave of semantic discussion about the term sentient. In this chapter we wrap up active inference main theoretical points from the first part of the book, chapter one through five, and its practical implementations from the second part six through ten. Then we connect the dots. We abstract away from the specific active inference models discussed in previous chapters to focus on integrative aspects of the framework benefits of activ. Summary of the book 10.2, chapter one, chapter two, chapter three, chapter 4567 and eight, no love chapter nine.
3209374	3226810	93	B	0.99988	53:29	26	You just read it. Go read it again. Connecting the dots. The integrative perspective on active inference, interestingly framed in terms of some early dennett work.
3229440	3313300	94	B	0.67	53:49	140	A call to model the whole iguana a complete cognitive creature, perhaps a simple one, and an environmental niche for it to cope with rather than single dimensional analyses and measurements on a complex system just too much like a Whirlwind to just measure and oh, well, brain regions correlated with this and this region is correlated with that. Those kinds of structural and behavioral, morphological any given measurement does not ever get at the underlying causal structure unless you specifically model it that way. Active inference helps with that issue by offering a first principle account of the ways in which organisms solve their adaptive problems. So by framing attention, memory, anticipation under common computational framings and a unified imperative it's possible to integrate different kinds of phenomena. Memory attention can be thought of as optimizing the same objective.
