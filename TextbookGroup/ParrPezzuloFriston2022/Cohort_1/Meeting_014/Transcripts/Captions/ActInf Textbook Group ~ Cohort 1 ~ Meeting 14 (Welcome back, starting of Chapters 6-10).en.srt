1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,540
okay we begin

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,899
welcome everyone it is

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,540
the resumption of

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,480
our cohort

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,839
update the video description it's the

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,539
resumption of cohort one of the active

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,279
inference textbook group

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,100
it's our 14 okay could someone mute

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,720
Giuseppe or feel free to say whatever

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,420
you want to say

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,560
well uh can you hear me yes yes okay so

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,360
sorry but I'm completely new to this

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,460
interface of a gather and uh encoder so

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,059
I I'm not sure I understand cohort one

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,020
and cohort 2 here is that so because

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,239
cohort one was the wasn't it the

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,180
previous one like the the one that yes

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,340
the start last year

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,460
well it's still going on

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,079
from May till July

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,539
we did chapters one through five

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,719
okay now we are in this cohort so if

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,280
those who did not participate in this

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
part like respectfully you know thanks

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
for the question but everyone in general

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,979
respectfully let's try to have people

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,140
who are in the cohort participate in it

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,000
everyone's welcome to join and of course

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,640
re-watch but contributions in the

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,259
questions and the chat are probably best

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,000
so that we can respect the people who

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,520
are continuing on

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,159
this is our 14th meeting and now we're

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,140
heading into the second five chapters of

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,280
the book

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
okay does any other person want to give

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,259
oh yeah go ahead

38
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,680
hold on so the the the the current one

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
that is going on right now is the cohort

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,259
one and not cohort two we're all

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,439
learning in different stages so the

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,200
previous hour was the cohort that is

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,759
focusing on chapters one through five

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,700
okay stage they're in and now some of us

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
a different set of people some are

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
joining both so that's why we made the

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,579
meetings convenient was so that we could

48
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,799
like for many of us who want to do it

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,579
both we can join or there's but

50
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,758
this is a separate set of people

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,020
I see I see yes so okay so cohort true

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,379
was was first and then I mean right in

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,360
the this meeting in this meeting right

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,900
now cohort 2 was first yes and now

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,540
which started correct before we warmed

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,200
up the chapters one through five

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,400
okay so I

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,560
read it because I I subscribed for

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,220
cohort too so excellent okay good thank

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,920
you so much see you next time thanks for

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,940
setting up all this yeah this thing

62
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,099
okay bye bye yes awesome

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,940
okay

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,940
anyone else want to add anything

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,660
we don't need to do a coda overview

66
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
I would say people who are watching this

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,459
recording can look at the live recording

68
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,680
if they want a code to update that we

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
just went through

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,780
for the cohort twos live meetings

71
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,879
but does anyone

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,159
want to give any um

73
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,780
introductory thoughts otherwise there's

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,760
a few ways I think we can go for this

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,620
session

76
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,040
but we're here just to

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,739
rejoin our activities and Orient towards

78
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,379
chapters six or ten

79
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,440
we can scan through the chapters

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,580
we can have any suggestions or

81
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,400
discussions around

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
ways to approach them I don't know

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,659
uh Rohan and then anyone else

84
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,659
I was wondering when are we gonna get to

85
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,060
the projects part or discussions about

86
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,840
the projects

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,299
great question let's look at the

88
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,060
chapters and see where that first off it

89
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,360
can happen however you want

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,120
with contacting people and

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
um like we can make a sub page like I

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
see exists here this looks really

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,660
awesome

94
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,820
so people can request a sub page they

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,960
can mention it that contact them

96
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,880
now or however

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,000
so it's up to you for a project that is

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,820
under your control

99
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
it can be developed in the open here or

100
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,560
however

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,120
you can also participate in many ongoing

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,580
projects like active block fronts which

103
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,960
also

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
um which might all share this

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,300
are get coin Grant was approved

106
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,320
yesterday

107
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,360
so if people

108
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
are familiar with this or want to become

109
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,740
familiar this is a way to like provide

110
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,139
or receive support possibly

111
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,180
for their learning in blockburns and

112
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,060
contributing to that open source package

113
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,360
[Music]

114
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
um

115
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,340
does that address what you were thinking

116
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,419
were you thinking about these project

117
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,100
ideas or were you thinking more about

118
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,660
like the sort of build your own model

119
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,520
approach that will be starting in

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,880
chapter six

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,979
I know about uh project ideas in the

122
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,220
quota page

123
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,860
awesome yeah like these are

124
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,639
um

125
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,320
well they're they're different different

126
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,300
types of projects clearly more will be

127
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,120
added but they're of different

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,580
they're not necessary they might involve

129
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,100
building a generative model but they are

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,180
not

131
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,280
degenerative model itself or only

132
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,259
let's look at chapter six

133
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,840
because this is where the generative

134
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,060
model construction is going to come into

135
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,740
play and so again there's a lot of

136
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,479
projects that

137
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,699
you would only need to qualitatively

138
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,400
think about generative models for like

139
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,160
educational material production

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,139
is related to the generative model or

141
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,699
could be modeled as a generative model

142
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,919
of a learner

143
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,020
but you wouldn't necessarily have to

144
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,440
make a general model but in chapter six

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,500
um

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,880
it's a recipe for Designing active

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,719
inference models

148
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,240
it is going to rock sorry just real

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,699
quick uh I think Luke is here uh doesn't

150
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,220
have access against or access

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,639
okay okay

152
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,460
message in Discord or I mean messaging

153
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,259
gather your email address and I'll add

154
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,440
you

155
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,860
Okay so

156
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,740
sorry I didn't

157
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,660
oh okay you requested access all right

158
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,360
I'll add you that's enough then

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
um

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,300
in chapter six it's going to ask some

161
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,039
questions

162
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,180
that are uh driving the design of the

163
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,099
generative model

164
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,319
which system of remodeling

165
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,060
system of Interest

166
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,039
what is the appropriate form for the

167
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,720
generative model

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,880
reflecting the discrete or continuous

169
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,400
distinction that we looked at

170
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,340
and also all these other questions that

171
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,500
aren't exactly within the textbook like

172
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,479
temporal depth hierarchical nesting

173
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,220
which parameters are learned versus

174
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,080
fixed all these different directions

175
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,360
that the models actually have to be

176
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,479
elaborated on even before getting to the

177
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,819
data engineering and maybe even code

178
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,199
implementation

179
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
just from a structural perspective what

180
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,500
form is it

181
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,840
how to set up the generative model

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,819
is where some of those analytical

183
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,240
details begin being introduced

184
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,819
not necessarily even the program level

185
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,919
implementation or an executable

186
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,560
simulation but like

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,259
okay we have a preference Vector that's

188
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,919
is that is there two states are is there

189
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,139
some continuous preference distribution

190
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,120
whatever it is

191
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,340
what is the actual details of the

192
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,440
generative model

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,940
and then

194
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,340
the other side of the coin slash blanket

195
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,560
is the generative process

196
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,639
so what are the endogenous Dynamics

197
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,299
and the um causal mapping with action

198
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,360
for the generative process

199
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,899
and there's kind of cases where you have

200
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,940
more of a communication setting active

201
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,399
inference entities on both sides

202
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,380
you could also have more of like a

203
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,180
simple simple

204
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,680
partnering

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,519
like two um deterministic programs that

206
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,080
send messages to each other or it could

207
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,500
be like one more cognitive

208
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,940
more agent-like generative model and one

209
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,360
more

210
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,459
environmental non-living type

211
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,019
any thoughts or overviews or how would

212
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,120
people think about

213
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
how can we make this type of a recipe

214
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,000
design should we be all designing a

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,300
model or how do we even go about reading

216
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,399
a section of the book in a chapter that

217
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,680
begins with a

218
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,580
recipe provision Lyle

219
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,160
yeah so so I I spent a lot of time

220
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,500
building what I think would be classed

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,080
here as generative models and what I

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,040
find is that this what I I characterize

223
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,860
it as the step of framing it up framing

224
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,240
up is is often far trickier sometimes

225
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,880
much harder frankly than building a

226
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,320
model depending on what what the

227
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,519
situation is

228
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,000
and in my experience I find that it all

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,779
comes down to making sure we understand

230
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:06,000
what is the question that we're trying

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,519
to answer right it's sort of like

232
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,700
because because every modeling process

233
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,700
I'm sure everybody on this call knows is

234
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,740
the process of deciding what to leave

235
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,380
out right what to put in what to leave

236
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,560
out and what level of representation

237
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,839
then it all has everything that's in

238
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,880
there if it's going to be a good model

239
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
has to be

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,220
necessary and necessary to

241
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,860
answer a question or provide a

242
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,560
particular Insight or so forth so that

243
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,220
whole issue of framing out uh what

244
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,100
you're going to build you know and in

245
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,620
all those different the 10 000 questions

246
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,540
yeah there's more than four you know

247
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,279
ultimately it's many

248
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,519
then it's all about that which often

249
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,980
means understanding the audience if

250
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,140
if the model builder is the only

251
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,680
audience this is a much simpler if the

252
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
audience is

253
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,579
um

254
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,000
uh you know some much larger group with

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,060
different perspectives a lack of of

256
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,180
homogeneity and insight then there

257
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,079
almost has to be uh I'm gonna say almost

258
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,019
a pre-modeling or framing process

259
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,620
of of sort of of framing up what are the

260
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,779
questions we care about and then we can

261
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,240
talk about how how those translate into

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
a model

263
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,839
so

264
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,220
that's just some general framing

265
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,140
thank you that's very

266
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,300
interesting it it

267
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,220
um makes me think about like this

268
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,779
audience question for the model like why

269
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,880
are we building the model why are we

270
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,680
shaping our regime of attention to build

271
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,839
this model

272
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,779
building can be an end of itself it can

273
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,000
be creative and expressive and fun and

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,519
all these other things and maybe later

275
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,860
there's a road that has some pragmatic

276
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,720
value too but also it can just be like

277
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,639
fun like you know what would a

278
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,260
generative model that could do this look

279
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,220
like and that can be very didactic

280
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,420
there's other times where you're

281
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,100
presenting information

282
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,720
oh I made a simulation of Twitter

283
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,079
discourse and dot dot dot

284
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,120
is always going to be presented in a way

285
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,380
that's not only just like the model

286
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,420
distilling down from the world but then

287
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,639
you're communicating it and then when

288
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
you're actually not just communicating

289
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,600
but if you're making an application that

290
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,399
does something and communication is

291
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,820
doing something as well then

292
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,420
the system of Interest as Lyle mentioned

293
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,940
is totally non-trivial and there's the

294
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,560
whole framing

295
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,680
in some of these early stages especially

296
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,820
because they can't always be changed

297
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,660
easily later

298
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,040
um run and then anyone else

299
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,519
uh yeah uh so I'm just curious when you

300
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
say who's the audience uh

301
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,200
is it that uh like isn't this part of

302
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,480
the active inference model itself that

303
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,260
okay so whatever makes sense in that

304
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,760
framework wouldn't that be the audience

305
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,860
here

306
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,880
thank you

307
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,940
as in it has to survive right your agent

308
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,060
has to survive so whatever generic model

309
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,980
helps it survive

310
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,980
would that not be the

311
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,040
model of choice over here and I'm just

312
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,100
curious I'm not sure that's awesome it's

313
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,740
awesome like way to frame it and it's

314
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,620
it's um maybe someone can share the um

315
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,959
free energy governance link

316
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,120
in the in the chat I just can't look it

317
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
up right now but but um

318
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
it puts this very nicely in in a recent

319
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,040
pretty short book dissertation about

320
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,639
like that imperative for organizations

321
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,360
and um yes in one sense it can be said

322
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,220
the right generative model or like the

323
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,019
audience for it is whatever its

324
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,079
survivability conditions are but and

325
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,760
within our textbook group The

326
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,839
survivability conditions are open

327
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,260
however we're also learning about or

328
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,860
even just gesturing towards

329
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,459
like

330
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,000
okay

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,959
not just we're gonna imagine a room with

332
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,820
a person who can take on a jacket or

333
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,680
take it off

334
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,680
um we can make that a didactic model and

335
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,060
the audience could be this textbook

336
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,019
group

337
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,000
or future cohorts of the textbook group

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,459
and the function could be just sort of

339
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,260
like a

340
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,720
neutral

341
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,519
Exemplar

342
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,279
active inference generative model but

343
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,139
then of course the considerations for

344
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,600
information presentation empirical data

345
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,019
analysis any kind of application

346
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,940
the system of interest is not just the

347
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,519
one person with the jacket on or off two

348
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,120
states room with a sign fluctuation

349
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,100
so that's a different situation for

350
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,980
model building so is that how should we

351
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,699
interpret this recipe

352
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,760
oh okay okay

353
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,660
but is there not like a journal

354
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,779
framework for what a good generative

355
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,420
model looks like is what I'm saying like

356
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,160
I I guess you could frame that

357
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,800
definitely so if you want to build pixel

358
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,839
level representations for example you

359
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
can use again and that's a pretty decent

360
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,940
one but maybe pixel level

361
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,339
representations are not a good

362
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,519
uh not good for the task at hand or

363
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,779
something like that so it should be able

364
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,240
we should it should fit a general

365
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,060
category right so this is what a good

366
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,160
set of models looks like for active

367
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,899
inference so that that sort of is

368
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,360
getting it

369
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,639
yeah that's a very fascinating framing

370
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,740
does anyone want to add something to

371
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,920
that

372
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,079
is I I totally hear you like on what is

373
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,759
there a is there a rubric like what are

374
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,339
we evaluating the generative model

375
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,560
and process

376
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,639
fit

377
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,019
because it's not like there's just

378
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,480
simply a best generative model you know

379
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,639
bigger or you know whatever no future

380
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,899
about it

381
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,380
except outside of a generative process

382
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,079
um context is the fitness

383
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,180
and then what is their rubric is our

384
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,860
gold standard is it like oh you're

385
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,779
dealing with audio data here's the file

386
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,100
format

387
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,259
that level of standardization certainly

388
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,459
not

389
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,339
however are there some

390
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,920
um practices or lenses that we could

391
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,620
bring in from people's experience with

392
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,880
evaluating model adequacy and relevancy

393
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
there probably are

394
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,300
Lyle

395
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,699
well yeah that really comes right back

396
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,180
to purpose right so a model is always

397
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,699
fit for purpose

398
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,419
and and you of course this also surfaces

399
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,400
the questions of model validation right

400
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,839
one of the things we haven't talked

401
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,500
about here is what's the right model how

402
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,059
do we frame up the right model what do

403
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,640
we choose to put in what leave out part

404
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,640
of that is purpose and and how would I

405
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,740
evaluate you know if I do what I'm

406
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,079
imagining a model will be how do I

407
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,559
evaluate its quality its validity well

408
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,960
what data is actually available that's

409
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,179
one thing you always have to ask at the

410
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,880
outset what data is available what data

411
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,700
can I use what's computationally

412
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,299
you know adequate and what parts of this

413
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,380
then uh when we kind of project

414
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,539
you know when we apply this model if

415
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,140
that's its role then does it fit for the

416
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,000
purpose does it provide you know good

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
you know adequate results and improve to

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,740
be you know whatever Behavior we're

419
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,240
trying to address

420
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,100
so

421
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,460
you can't you can't say if it's good if

422
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,440
you don't have a purpose so if your

423
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,240
purpose is just to explore model

424
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,220
building which is something I love to do

425
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,960
then

426
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,660
that's a pretty big there's a lot of

427
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,820
things that are fit for that purpose

428
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,140
right but if the purpose is to

429
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,580
um uh you know Pro do a prospective uh

430
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
analysis of a system and what actions

431
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,980
might be taken to intervene then that's

432
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,640
in a different thing

433
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,220
thanks a lot for sharing it I'm I'm

434
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,419
really

435
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,400
happy and I think it's relevant that

436
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
we're having this kind of a discussion

437
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,980
because we've gone through some of the

438
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,539
first chapters

439
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,820
and we will continue through chapter six

440
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,559
I think into having this conversation

441
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,600
but

442
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,460
does anybody else want to add something

443
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,539
about this more General topic of like

444
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,059
how are we even coming to talk about

445
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,760
what system or how are we framing the

446
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,200
system that we're modeling

447
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,200
that's in section 6.3

448
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,760
I um

449
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean this is too broad to it's not

450
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
active in French specific but

451
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
whenever I'm trying to model something

452
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,900
the only questions that I mean it is

453
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,840
contextual to the purpose it entails a

454
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,299
purpose in an audience but all I want to

455
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,220
know basically is

456
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,940
what are the questions that need this

457
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,919
model needs to like generate an answer

458
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,220
for

459
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,220
um what is the information that is like

460
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,980
necessarily therefore kind of required

461
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,640
to

462
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,200
Model A system that would have such

463
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,299
answers in it

464
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,520
uh

465
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,080
and maybe another

466
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,020
way to say the same thing is that

467
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,299
like what affordances

468
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,840
would the model acquire

469
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,960
to answer address

470
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,419
whatever the some set of questions that

471
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,760
are posed to the system so if you asked

472
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,299
you know

473
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,840
I don't know

474
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,740
um like how frequently does a yellow

475
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,440
colored car I don't know drive down this

476
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,100
particular Road

477
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,980
um then I wouldn't need to record like

478
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,159
the number of bikes or their colors

479
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,260
uh that are you know

480
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,340
using the bike lane or buses or trucks

481
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,460
large you know so and like this is um

482
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,140
maybe outside the scope of what I mean

483
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,320
by yellow how many

484
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,900
you know cars out of all the cars how

485
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,340
many are yellow or something that's

486
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,100
right driving down this road or whatever

487
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,020
um it's like

488
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,200
not a even exactly a generative model

489
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,299
but my point is that

490
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,280
modeling that system there there is

491
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,780
obvious data that's like completely

492
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,580
irrelevant right

493
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,080
um and so

494
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,880
uh

495
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,679
if you were going to build some sort of

496
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,240
simulation of any kind that's going to

497
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,059
be generative like

498
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,460
there's often a lot of data that's just

499
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,320
completely extraneous depending on what

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,960
questions you're going to ask of it

501
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,559
so

502
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,840
thanks

503
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,520
in six three

504
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,799
in the first paragraphs

505
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,200
they're gonna come out hard on the

506
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,220
interface concept of Markov blanket

507
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
this is how you'll do system modeling is

508
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,380
by finding interfaces that distinguish

509
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,600
the internal and external states of a

510
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,919
system

511
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,299
then

512
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,980
that

513
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,159
is critiqued or elaborated

514
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
because there's an infinite degrees of

515
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,520
freedom

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,280
in the core screenings and those are

517
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,159
modeler specific

518
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,740
and they suggest that that matters

519
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,280
especially if you want to be considering

520
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,679
embodied extended perspectives

521
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,860
where just descriptive

522
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,919
interfacing models won't give you the

523
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,860
whole answer there's a great paper could

524
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,480
a neuroscientist understand a

525
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,039
microprocessor

526
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,840
showing that even if you have total

527
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
access to the microprocessors firing

528
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,200
like an EEG and a generated set of

529
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,480
single and double lesions

530
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,000
a lot of the interpretations would be

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,100
strongly misleading

532
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,440
um yet people want the wiring Circuit of

533
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,419
the brain which is dynamic and also

534
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,460
involves diffusive molecules

535
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,740
we have all 302

536
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,260
nematode neurons mapped

537
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,039
but that also as an interface diagram is

538
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,780
not even close

539
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,460
so if you want to describe the nematode

540
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,159
like model building then it's a fit for

541
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,299
purpose

542
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,220
however there might be very simple

543
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,780
models

544
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,059
that could be doing a lot better in this

545
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,320
in

546
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,820
nematode Behavior observation

547
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,100
the form

548
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,679
is discussed there are three main design

549
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,500
choices first discrete and continuous

550
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,260
time we had some awesome discussions in

551
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,580
the previous months about like

552
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,559
similarities and differences

553
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,080
and where like in theory they're

554
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,299
different and then in practice where

555
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,559
they're different

556
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,659
the whole question of like discretizing

557
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,240
continuous systems

558
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,100
um the second choice is between shallow

559
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,419
models

560
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,940
and hierarchical models where inference

561
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,820
operates at multiple time scales

562
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,100
the third choice is the consideration

563
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,140
only of the present

564
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,720
kind of the variational free energy

565
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
versus models with temporal depth

566
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,580
temporal depth consideration could be

567
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,500
purely passive

568
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,100
and it could also include some elements

569
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,419
of

570
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,860
affordance

571
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,159
which if we remember to like the B

572
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,980
Matrix actions are influencing how

573
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,200
States the world are changing

574
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,600
through time so

575
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,200
that is how active inference is unifying

576
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,799
policy comparison by kind of embedding

577
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,020
action into

578
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,120
estimates of how things could evolve

579
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,779
probabilistically

580
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,120
those three design decisions are

581
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,159
explored in slightly more detail in the

582
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,440
subsections

583
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,840
six five how to set up the generative

584
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,580
model

585
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,860
after specification

586
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,159
then the specific variables have to be

587
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,539
included

588
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,059
okay the latent State temperature is

589
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,400
going to be continuous the observations

590
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,260
in my thermometer I'm going to take in

591
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,140
as just integers and then there's going

592
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,200
to be a person who is going to be in a

593
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,279
binary state of like whether it's hot or

594
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,919
cold or maybe I want hot neutral cold or

595
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,059
maybe I want them to have a 10 point

596
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,820
scale or I want them to have um a scale

597
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,860
that's doing Dot

598
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,799
that is in this stage of actually

599
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,559
setting up the generative model

600
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,460
and giving a little bit of like

601
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,720
color

602
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,419
to what had been

603
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,539
just outlined

604
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,120
it's going to be a nested model with

605
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,679
this continuous variable and this kind

606
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,580
of a discrete variable

607
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:47,940
um

608
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,000
here we return to the Frog

609
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,700
example from earlier in the book

610
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,220
where there's like but it's kind of

611
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,559
being generalized a little bit it was

612
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,419
introduced with the whole Bayesian

613
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,059
equation walkthrough now we're returning

614
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,880
to it and thinking more about multimodal

615
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,100
or like even you could consider this as

616
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,600
Sensor Fusion

617
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,779
because there's some hidden cause

618
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,600
the jumping or the action of a frog

619
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,400
that is inducing several domains of

620
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,919
impact potentially in the generative

621
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:24,120
process

622
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,640
and then that leads to specific

623
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,600
observables from the perspective of the

624
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,940
cognitive entity

625
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,039
those could be again two communicative

626
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,799
cognitive entities or one and not or

627
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,419
however

628
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,159
so this is like okay

629
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,440
we're going to be modeling

630
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,299
forest fires

631
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,799
so forest fires they change the

632
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
temperature they change the

633
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,260
chemical composition they change the

634
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,080
vibrations in the ground or something

635
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,000
okay and then maybe there's three

636
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,020
sensors maybe you have three

637
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,340
thermometers

638
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,840
and then what about them are you gonna

639
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,940
average them are they going to be like

640
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,000
three parallel modeled Time series

641
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,900
that is where some more specification of

642
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,720
the generative model comes into play

643
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,039
keeping

644
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,860
this the active inference ontology in

645
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,880
mind

646
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,100
what are the affordances the Frog what

647
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,440
are the latent States

648
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,179
that are being changing through time

649
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,860
like sound

650
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,399
physical presence or Photon emission or

651
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,500
something and then what are the data

652
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,890
that would be oh the observations

653
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,220
[Music]

654
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,779
um

655
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,240
this box looks like it's about

656
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,279
different sensory modalities I'm sure

657
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,200
there's a lot of interesting

658
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,480
discussions we could bring in here

659
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,220
priors and empirical Behavior

660
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,679
complete class theorems

661
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,080
any statistical decision procedure

662
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,600
Behavior may be framed as Bayes optimal

663
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,039
under the right set of Prior beliefs

664
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,080
discussion of fixed and learned

665
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,700
variables

666
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,620
one can imagine the pros and the cons

667
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,559
generally of having fixed and learned

668
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,880
variables

669
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,620
like

670
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,140
computationally it's simpler to fix a

671
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,320
hard-coded variable however if there's a

672
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,539
setting where the model's adequacy

673
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,059
depends on being able to update that

674
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,980
maybe you want it learnable

675
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,200
however then you have to deal with these

676
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,940
questions about like the kinetics of

677
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,000
learning like instantly switch or slow

678
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,899
switch or Trend averaging so there's a

679
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,399
lot of discussions around learning how

680
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,960
is attention

681
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,299
regulated what is precision on learning

682
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,940
it's like it very much complexifies the

683
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,440
model

684
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,440
and there's many variables that you can

685
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,640
bring into a learnable setting

686
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,880
but when it's framed as just static

687
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,020
variables

688
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,360
and only like the hidden States changing

689
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,460
through time that's like the simplest

690
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,320
case

691
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,360
but more and more cognitive entities

692
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,000
probably are going to entail

693
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,740
considering learning Dynamics

694
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,980
setting up the generative process

695
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,020
the reason we postponed the design of

696
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,940
the generative process

697
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,020
so

698
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,600
a little slate of hands

699
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,419
entity first not the um

700
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,240
Niche first is that in many practical

701
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,039
applications discussed in this book we

702
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,480
simply assume the Dynamics of the

703
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,279
generative process are the same or very

704
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
similar to the generative model

705
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,600
we generally assume the agent's

706
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,159
generative model closely mimics the

707
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,779
process that generates its observation

708
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,220
that is clearly a simplifying case

709
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,460
because it doesn't address

710
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,260
what if

711
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,260
you're paying attention to predicting

712
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,020
with and the world is dependent on

713
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
height

714
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,720
there's so many

715
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,820
complexities of that which is really

716
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,799
that broader like what is being modeled

717
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,740
what matters question

718
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,679
but in some

719
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,980
way very upstream or very close to the

720
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,419
Stream

721
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,279
it is like the rabbit being put in the

722
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,299
Hat

723
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,840
like if the rat knows that there's a 5x5

724
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,159
maze

725
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,159
that's a huge amount of information

726
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,380
versus if it only has access to Pure

727
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,960
local information

728
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,179
and uh that that's just something to

729
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:48,899
like

730
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,700
I think for us to note as we look

731
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,200
through models

732
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,120
like are we modeling the generative

733
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,240
process oh so the seasons oscillate so

734
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,220
it is a sine wave

735
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,720
so then the generative model of the

736
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,580
agent is also going to be fitting a side

737
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,720
wave

738
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,100
well then

739
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,200
it kind of collapses to like a

740
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,539
stochastic regression

741
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,720
and maybe then it looks like the fit is

742
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,559
going to be very good

743
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,940
active inference modeling brings in

744
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,919
another complexity with action

745
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,140
influencing outcomes

746
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,940
that prevents some

747
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,700
um I guess fallacies of modeling but by

748
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,620
no means all it probably introduces many

749
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,260
others Eric

750
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,539
yeah uh can you hear me uh this is a

751
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,419
news sounds good um so this this might

752
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,700
be a time to to um to discuss the

753
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,820
question I posted and I apologize I

754
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,039
didn't put it in the right place the

755
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,000
other day

756
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,740
um I just figured out today that it goes

757
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,019
under this particular location but this

758
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,700
is about the question about

759
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,779
um

760
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,720
why modeling of a generative process is

761
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,980
necessary

762
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,899
is a necessary step for building an

763
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,700
active inference model so let me just

764
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,899
read it

765
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,419
um yeah because it's a lot of words uh

766
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,100
so you know we know that an active

767
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,659
inference agent employs a generative

768
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,100
model as this model of the external

769
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,799
world and it uses its General model to

770
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,380
perform inferences about perceptual

771
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,539
input and to make decisions about actors

772
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,480
so in general the external world is

773
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,620
complex and unknowable to the uh to the

774
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,380
agent the generative model may or may

775
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,299
not be able to learn but if learning is

776
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,640
supposed to uh if it is learning is

777
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,320
opposed to put the generative model in a

778
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,640
better alignment with the world's

779
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,980
generative process whatever that may be

780
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,679
so I can see how one might model the

781
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,299
generative process

782
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,240
if one is building an artificial agent

783
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,100
in a laboratory where you kind of have

784
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,279
access you you control how the world

785
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,679
behaves with respect to the agent and

786
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,000
then you might want to study how well

787
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,860
the agent design

788
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,659
um Works versus you know one versus

789
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,120
another under control conditions but

790
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,679
this is not the same as designing an

791
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
agent to go out and cope with some real

792
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,100
world environment where you really don't

793
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,679
know what the generative process is so I

794
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,299
think that the recipe for designing an

795
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,340
active interest models would

796
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,200
include formally setting up the

797
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,539
generative process only in the kind of a

798
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,460
laboratory situation but not if you're

799
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,019
really trying to build something out you

800
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,519
know for the for the real world because

801
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,539
you don't

802
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,880
know the general process you might

803
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,679
create an artificial laboratory kind of

804
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,140
situation by trying to build a model of

805
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,760
how the world works and say well how

806
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,740
does my agent work under that those

807
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,159
assumptions or not but that you know

808
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,779
that might set you up for putting the

809
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,640
agent in the real world but in in fact

810
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,019
you don't know the degenerative process

811
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,460
if you're really trying to build

812
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,320
something to to work in the real real

813
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,700
world

814
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,860
That's my kind of my question that's a

815
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,039
question

816
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,419
thank you Lyle

817
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,179
well I I love uh Eric I love that that

818
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,039
framing because I think there's multiple

819
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,440
different cases right so I think if

820
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,159
you're modeling something uh that as you

821
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,579
say goes in in the real world then you

822
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,040
know perhaps it's a you know some

823
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,280
sentient creature or being

824
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,719
um then

825
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,659
then it could obviously there's

826
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,820
the real world even if we knew

827
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,699
everything about it is too complex to

828
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,119
model right so so that's that's Fool's

829
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,918
Gold you know to assume you know

830
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,239
everything right

831
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,960
there and and so I don't I'm just gonna

832
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,000
say yeah that's hard you know typically

833
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,739
I guess we would say what are the parts

834
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,480
of the generative the real world

835
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,879
degenerative uh process that we're going

836
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,320
to

837
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,079
consider relevant and deal with that and

838
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,179
knowing that we're making a leap of

839
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,960
faith but there's another case I think

840
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,179
which is is more generalizable just to

841
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,820
come a complex adaptive systems that

842
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,820
operate in what I call the built world

843
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,200
all right so uh I'm I work with a bunch

844
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,359
of people who build digital twins they

845
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,880
build digital twins of

846
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,099
um human infrastructure

847
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,920
right so buildings and all this stuff

848
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,260
they're the generative process that

849
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,859
we're concerned with is largely knowable

850
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,339
right and largely represent

851
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:26,880
representable and so and and what's

852
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,400
interesting about that is there are a

853
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,640
bunch of blind spots and inadequacies in

854
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,900
what we know about that generative

855
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,960
process and the ability to do inference

856
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,540
about what the real state of that system

857
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,720
is then becomes the value of this

858
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,640
approach in that setting right so so I

859
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,619
think I I don't think there's a general

860
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,060
answer once again I think it really

861
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,099
comes down to purpose and what the

862
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,440
specific framing you're looking to do to

863
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,140
me this ability to say something about

864
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,180
what I I like that idea of decision

865
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,960
agents right decision agents that uh are

866
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,180
going to potentially take action or

867
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,220
infer actual States

868
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,099
is is much richer than what a lot of the

869
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,800
modeling historical modeling paradigms

870
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,800
have given us so I think that's really

871
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
interesting

872
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,098
thank you Lyle Ali

873
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,640
uh yeah and uh I also think that the

874
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,920
distinction between uh General surprises

875
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,640
and generative models

876
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,940
becomes significant uh if we want to

877
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,640
simulate learning rather than just

878
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,660
inference uh I mean that's the answer I

879
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,599
got from Ryan Smith because I asked him

880
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,940
almost the same question why would why

881
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,920
do we need generative process in order

882
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,200
to

883
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,240
simulate the agents and

884
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,359
um because you see for the generative

885
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,800
process

886
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,640
uh

887
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,060
if if the generative model exactly Maps

888
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,160
them to generative process we only need

889
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,520
that capital D Matrix right but uh and

890
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,980
that just when we're just trying to

891
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,560
stimulate the inference side of the

892
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,020
agent right but when the learning comes

893
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,560
along then we need to separate uh that

894
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,500
capital d uh from another Matrix

895
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,079
probably

896
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,099
the case D which Maps into the generator

897
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,859
process so yeah one of the situations

898
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,560
that the distinction between two might

899
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,540
be necessary is when we when those two

900
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,000
process I mean learning and inference

901
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,300
are taken as two separate phenomena to

902
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,460
model

903
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,380
thanks

904
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,500
um one note is also there's work on

905
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,839
symmetries in the generative process

906
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,820
generative model like I think like the

907
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,180
bi-directional paper with Matt Sims and

908
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,740
blue

909
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,020
um discussing it and then

910
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,880
um

911
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,180
here will be a defense to Eric's

912
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,880
excellent question

913
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,380
um

914
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,619
The Entity first modeling approach

915
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,680
that's taken by this chapter

916
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,500
one can say I don't know whether I'm

917
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,560
going to a forest or a desert but I'm

918
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,980
going to have these sensors on my

919
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,839
designed interface

920
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:40,140
and I'm going to do extensive modeling

921
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,680
on interception and homeostasis

922
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,320
and if I can learn policies that balance

923
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
homeostasis

924
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
then I've survived

925
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,500
if I fail then

926
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,000
failure happens

927
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,099
so that doesn't mean that it works or

928
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,060
it's doing the right thing fit for

929
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,420
purpose any of those aspects but one of

930
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,599
the insights from the 4E and the

931
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,660
embodied side is like a vast amount of

932
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,680
our

933
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,619
what is modelable as cognitive

934
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,380
isn't necessarily

935
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,420
the declarative

936
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,920
I think therefore I am

937
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,320
possibly even symbolic type thinking

938
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,940
linguistic

939
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,099
there's a lot going on

940
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,760
and many of that a lot going on

941
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,700
can be simplified by not even knowing

942
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,040
about the external process maybe not

943
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
even the as modeled kidney knowing about

944
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,880
what the as modeled liver is doing

945
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,980
so this type of a focus was like we're

946
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,460
going to Define

947
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,040
our entity types

948
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,200
and the kinds of observations that they

949
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,359
can make the kinds of affordances that

950
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,060
they have or do empirically or that they

951
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,078
conceptually could do

952
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,420
that approach

953
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,660
um is consistent with embodied

954
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,300
biological systems and Persistence of

955
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,819
organizations and

956
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:20,400
so I'm wondering how that piece comes

957
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,839
into play with this discussion that's

958
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,060
very important about and also their

959
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,380
their

960
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,300
earlier discussion of the embedded and

961
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,700
extended cognition is that it kind of

962
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,260
blurs the line

963
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,940
with what is a generative model what is

964
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,440
a generative process

965
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,940
so

966
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,680
hence there being a lot of

967
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,760
thinking and attention

968
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,839
on what the system's modeling is

969
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,339
what are the known unknowns and the

970
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,440
unknown unknown is going to be

971
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,300
let's just see

972
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,140
um

973
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,220
a chapter ends

974
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,700
six seven simulating visualizing

975
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,800
analyzing and fitting data using active

976
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,819
inference

977
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,619
so

978
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,480
standard routines for active inference

979
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,339
that provide support for all functions

980
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,400
are available

981
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,119
#spm

982
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,040
and appendix C

983
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,859
step-by-step model is a great

984
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,880
look through this this is Matlab code

985
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,200
one amazing work that we could all

986
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,480
iterate on would be porting Matlab

987
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,119
into the ontology

988
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,180
into Python and or Julia with pi mdp or

989
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,099
active block friends

990
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,339
but there's a lot in SPM and some of its

991
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,099
neuroimaging specific some of it's very

992
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,160
variational base specific not all of it

993
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,319
is going to be state-of-the-art

994
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:52,079
or the most useful in every situation

995
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,540
however

996
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,940
I wonder if only offering certain

997
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,859
routines in Matlab

998
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,540
which is like a traditionally very

999
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,040
academic

1000
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,740
software platform and potentially

1001
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,599
non-free

1002
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,260
um

1003
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,380
can be a limiting factor so

1004
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,200
those who feel like they want to learn

1005
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,020
more or contribute this way

1006
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,599
helping

1007
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,079
structure some of the code

1008
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,819
architecture so it cohorts coming

1009
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:24,720
through

1010
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,599
can be doing multiple language maybe

1011
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,280
first we can just move some of these

1012
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,500
routines into a folder

1013
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,900
and then people can start to organize

1014
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,000
those types of um aspects

1015
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,540
summary

1016
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,819
it's a four-step recipe

1017
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:43,200
we walk through it from the

1018
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,839
consideration of the system of Interest

1019
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:47,480
broadly like the entity and the process

1020
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,940
focusing in on the entity specifically

1021
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,380
thinking structurally about what it is

1022
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,099
going to be like doing slash composed of

1023
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,900
specifying that to a few levels of

1024
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,359
detail then doing the same for the

1025
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,480
generative process and then once that is

1026
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,740
specified

1027
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,839
it's not quite quite there

1028
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,720
for most people today but

1029
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,280
where

1030
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,280
it seems like they are laying out a path

1031
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,460
towards and where we probably can and

1032
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,660
will be after that level of setup

1033
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,200
in some potentially graphical editor or

1034
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,000
parameter file

1035
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,339
then

1036
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:33,359
as as SPM and Matlab have done in many

1037
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,460
many papers the generative model

1038
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,940
specification almost prepares the

1039
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,560
working script

1040
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,000
but there's still a lot of details and

1041
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,740
and pieces to add in especially in a

1042
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,020
modern environment and for all of these

1043
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,359
like non-standard and novel cases that

1044
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,180
people are wanting to consider but that

1045
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,520
is once we have a notebook that goes

1046
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,660
through the recipe

1047
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,599
then the recipes can be forked and so on

1048
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,040
and they can be written in different

1049
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,259
languages Pi mdp block friends Ali

1050
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,099
yeah and just one thing that I think is

1051
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:11,339
not made made explicit in this chapter

1052
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:14,220
is that actually that first step which

1053
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,099
system are we modeling especially uh the

1054
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,960
identification of the marker blanket

1055
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,619
part is uh basically at this point of

1056
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,220
active inference research uh is more

1057
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,300
like a like a hypothetical step because

1058
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,579
um

1059
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:35,099
I I also had a misapprehension that uh

1060
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:39,300
we can somehow uh identify the markup

1061
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,160
blankets from data but then as I went on

1062
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,180
through my project and by Consulting

1063
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,740
Maxwell and others

1064
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,560
um actually this is the comment Maxwell

1065
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,380
uh made about my proposal that he said

1066
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,720
that identifying markup blanket from

1067
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,660
data is still an outstanding issue that

1068
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,560
is not resolved yet in the uh research

1069
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,800
and active inference and one of the most

1070
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,560
active areas areas of research they're

1071
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,859
doing at versus lab is just focused on

1072
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:20,640
this part of the modeling recipe I mean

1073
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,599
how to how we can

1074
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,400
identify automatically identify or

1075
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,800
somehow learn the markup blanket from

1076
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,560
just pure data points

1077
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,040
awesome and that ties in with Dalton s's

1078
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,380
work on the blanket index and like

1079
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,839
continuous variables for dynamic

1080
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,099
Assemblies of blanketing like it this is

1081
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,680
gonna get really

1082
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,260
nuanced and empirical

1083
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,619
with the discovery and the thresholding

1084
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,720
of Markov blankets and causal inference

1085
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,280
in Real World Systems with many

1086
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,260
different kinds of sensors and doing

1087
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,359
structure learning on generative model

1088
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,119
and process and like everything

1089
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,220
empirically which is why as a

1090
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,250
simplifying step

1091
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:07,680
[Music]

1092
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,460
um

1093
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,460
the uh it actually really reminds me of

1094
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,900
how Dave Snowden

1095
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,119
situates the difference between systems

1096
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,099
thinking and complexity thinking

1097
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,440
which is systems often uses like a lot

1098
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,839
of nodes and flow charts to represent

1099
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,540
system elements and relationships and

1100
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,960
like interfaces whereas in complexity in

1101
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,420
the canevan especially

1102
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,619
um framing

1103
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,819
it's like more like

1104
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:37,560
self-organizing sand dunes

1105
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,400
and so causal relationships might be

1106
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,420
very much in flux and it puts a higher

1107
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,819
focus on action rather than system

1108
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,380
description

1109
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,000
especially in situations like moving

1110
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,280
your head where the relationship of

1111
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,839
different things

1112
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,520
is going to be heavily action dependent

1113
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,859
um and so for now we're kind of in the

1114
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:05,400
systems world where it's like a priori

1115
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,920
hero the system interfaces

1116
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,680
and then we're going to take whether

1117
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,000
it's a heuristic or whether you take a

1118
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,140
literal interpretation but you don't

1119
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,160
have to

1120
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,020
you could just say I'm taking

1121
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,760
heuristically

1122
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,660
the approach of the systems mapping

1123
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,000
but that's not to say that that

1124
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,660
generative model couldn't be trained in

1125
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,520
a systems mapped

1126
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,020
context

1127
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,220
and then placed into a different setting

1128
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,260
where there was a mismatch or a

1129
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,960
different generative model

1130
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,119
and so it's going to be an ongoing

1131
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,700
discussion how are when are these lines

1132
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,980
drawn one other point

1133
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,380
um other than not needing to use last

1134
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,980
names to refer to specific Concepts

1135
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,359
um like

1136
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,000
are we talking about the blanket that's

1137
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,579
statistically insulates every

1138
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,280
partition of nodes in these base graphs

1139
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,740
which are going to be vast

1140
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,040
as Ali and Jacob and I were discussing

1141
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,200
on the um branching time active

1142
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,619
inference from uh just a few days ago

1143
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,520
yesterday

1144
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,579
like these graphs are going to be vast

1145
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:19,800
and so just saying there will be a

1146
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,059
markout blanket in fact there will be

1147
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:23,460
many Markov blankets with different

1148
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,140
semantics that you might assign to them

1149
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,440
or not

1150
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,359
how does that map onto the real world is

1151
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:31,260
like

1152
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,260
the realism instrumentalism

1153
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,020
pragmatism abduction conversation that

1154
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,079
we've been having do you come in with

1155
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,920
these kinds of boundaries

1156
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,380
heuristically and distinctions

1157
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,740
or how many levels

1158
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,440
of uncertainty in nesting I don't know

1159
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,380
how many categories of blank there are

1160
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,540
I don't know if it's a category or a

1161
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,880
Continuum of this

1162
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,880
you can actually still take on multiple

1163
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,280
levels of uncertainty in the modeling

1164
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,559
but then fitting it with empirical data

1165
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:10,440
if it's fit for purpose use is to do

1166
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,940
some sort of statistical inference or

1167
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,540
like provide meaning or action

1168
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,660
but just didactically when the model's

1169
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,359
purpose is educational then there's a

1170
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,859
lot of things in architectures we might

1171
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,960
play with

1172
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,920
and then the recipe and also this

1173
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,640
conversation uh

1174
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,000
helps I hope hold space for the

1175
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,740
educational and the Curiosity driven

1176
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,180
model development where we're going to

1177
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,579
have a lot of fun and interesting

1178
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,380
GMS

1179
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,359
and

1180
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,819
people's applications

1181
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,460
and working with different real world

1182
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,240
constraints

1183
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,319
in different settings we'll all be

1184
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,640
learning a lot

1185
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,319
from it

1186
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,079
and hopefully some of it will be

1187
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,680
in repos we can reference

1188
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,780
other people may want to play around

1189
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,319
inversion within Boulders that we can

1190
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,339
make

1191
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,380
if anybody wants to be added as a

1192
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,480
collaborator in this

1193
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,559
textbook repo which is just pretty much

1194
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,280
empty

1195
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,200
except for I guess a script from Jacob

1196
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,559
and there'll be more to say on probably

1197
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:34,440
GitHub and on

1198
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,300
um as we continue through but in these

1199
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,000
last minutes does anyone have any

1200
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,880
thoughts for our continuation of the

1201
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,240
cohort

1202
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,900
I have one one question uh Daniel you

1203
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,880
referenced a paper earlier in the

1204
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,900
discussion

1205
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,500
um

1206
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,079
that I'd love to get the reference to

1207
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:57,720
about uh Persistence of organizations

1208
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,640
and survivability

1209
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,240
oh yes

1210
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,660
um all right

1211
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,579
I will put it into

1212
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,020
um

1213
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,099
into resources

1214
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,099
here here's the work

1215
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,300
um

1216
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,760
it's a PhD dissertation that was

1217
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,040
published as a book and I'll upload the

1218
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,220
PDF as well this is uh extremely

1219
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,720
interesting

1220
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,259
work

1221
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,020
and okay yeah just it just came out and

1222
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,800
um

1223
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,300
uh

1224
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,619
okay

1225
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:52,440
in our last minutes it's too too fun not

1226
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,640
to share

1227
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,640
foreign

1228
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:03,020
has written the forward

1229
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,559
um

1230
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,839
what is a firm's purpose what is an

1231
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,460
organization's purpose

1232
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,440
it's as difficult to answer as why am I

1233
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,380
here free energy governance

1234
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,420
and the fep

1235
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,160
inverts the question

1236
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,680
instead of asking how a system how must

1237
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,300
the system behave to survive it asks how

1238
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,819
do systems that survive behave

1239
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,619
the answer is rather deflationary they

1240
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,180
survive their purpose is just

1241
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,859
sustainability

1242
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:29,940
so

1243
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,240
some classic fristianisms

1244
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:40,260
um some very nice framings on page 95

1245
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,940
there's uh

1246
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,319
some great juxtapositions

1247
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,440
so it it's always awesome to see this

1248
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,720
kind of quality

1249
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,339
work

1250
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,319
and

1251
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,319
who knows what people here will see and

1252
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,020
I don't see any scripts here

1253
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,140
that's the textbook but

1254
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,119
who knows

1255
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,099
maybe we can do some generative modeling

1256
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:12,000
of organizations or we can

1257
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,900
specify it and iterate on it

1258
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,660
realize it in Block friends and pi mdp

1259
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:25,220
and Forney lab and jf's symbolic sweet

1260
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,079
so there'll be a lot of fun things to

1261
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,920
explore this cohort

1262
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,900
any other questions or ideas that people

1263
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,319
want to share

1264
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,200
thanks and congratulations to people for

1265
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,280
joining this continuation it's a a great

1266
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,619
continuance

1267
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:52,460
and

1268
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,020
well I know that this part is going to

1269
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,059
be very interesting

1270
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,200
the next three months will be

1271
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,680
interesting
