650	164420	00:00	It's the resumption of cohort one of the active inference textbook group. This is our 14th meeting and now we're heading into the second five chapters of the book. Everyone's welcome to join and of course rewatch, but contributions and the questions and the chat are probably best.	This is the resumption of cohort one of the active inference textbook group	CLCD1
166710	698716	02:46	This is a way to provide or receive support possibly for their learning in block prints and contributing to that open source package. In chapter six, it's a recipe for designing active inference models. There are different types of projects. Clearly more will be added.	When are we going to get to the projects part or discussions about the projects	Coda 3, The Projects
698738	1135972	11:38	Model building can be an end of itself. It can be creative and expressive and fun and all these other things. The right model is always fit for purpose. Is there a rubric like, what are we evaluating the generative model and process fit?	Lyle: It makes me think about this audience question for the model	The Audience Question for the Generative Model
1136136	1898370	18:56	There are three main design choices. First, discrete and continuous time. How to set up the generative model after specification. Then the specific variables have to be included. Those three design decisions are explored in slightly more detail in subsections 65.	Bay: There are three main design choices when modeling continuous systems	General Design of a Generative Model
1898520	2177340	31:38	Lyle: Why is modeling of a generative process necessary for building an active inference model? He says in general, the external world is complex and unknowable to the agent. Lyle: The recipe for designing an active. inference models would include formally setting up the generative. process only in the kind of the laboratory situation. But not if you're trying to build something out for the real world.	An active inference agent uses a generative model as its model of external world	Inferring from a Generative Process
2178590	2453550	36:18	The distinction between generative process and generative models become significant if we want to simulate learning rather than just inference. The entity first modeling approach that's taken by this chapter is consistent with embodied biological systems and persistence of organizations.	The distinction between generative process and generative models becomes significant when learning occurs	In the Generative Process and Its Generative Models
2457860	2641692	40:57	Six, seven simulating, visualizing, analyzing, and fitting data using active inference. Hashtag SPM and Appendix C step by Step model. Would be porting MATLAB into the ontology into Python and or Julia with Pi MDP or active blockference.	This is MATLAB code one amazing work that we could all iterate on	Inferring with MATLAB: a four step recipe
2641826	2865248	44:01	Identifying markup blanket from data is still an outstanding issue that is not resolved yet in the research on active inference. This is going to get really nuanced and empirical with the discovery and the thresholding of Markov blankets and causal inference in real world systems. When are these lines drawn?	Identification of markup blankets is still an outstanding issue in active inference research	Markov Blanketing and Inclusion
2865344	3042700	47:45	Are we talking about the blanket that statistically insulates every partition of nodes in these Bayes graphs, which are going to be vast? How does that map onto the real world? And also this conversation helps, I hope, hold space for the educational and the curiosity driven model development.	This cohort holds space for the educational and the curiosity driven model development	Post-Bayesian inference: The Blanket
3046720	3238300	50:46	Daniel: Here's a PhD dissertation that was published as a book. Karl Friston has written a foreword. It asks, how do systems that survive behave? The answer is rather deflationary. Their purpose is just sustainability. Any other questions or ideas that people want to share?	Daniel: I have a question about persistence of organizations and survivability	Organization and the FEP
