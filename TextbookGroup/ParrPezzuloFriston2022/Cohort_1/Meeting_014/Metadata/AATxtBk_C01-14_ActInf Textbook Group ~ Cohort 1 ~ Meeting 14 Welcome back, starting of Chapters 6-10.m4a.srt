1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,430
It's. Okay, we began.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,262
Welcome everyone. It is the

3
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:13,034
resumption of our cohort update

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,774
the video description. It's the

5
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:18,538
resumption of cohort one of the active

6
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:21,962
inference textbook group. It's our 14.

7
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:24,126
Okay, could someone mute Gsuppie or feel

8
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:25,640
free to say whatever you want to say.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,800
Can you hear me? Yes.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,886
Okay, so sorry, but I'm completely new

11
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,294
to this interface of a gather and

12
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,898
encoder, so I'm not sure

13
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:42,874
I understand cohort one and cohort two

14
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:46,534
here because cohort

15
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,834
one, wasn't it the previous one like the

16
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:52,780
one that start last year?

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,826
Well, it's still going on from May till

18
00:00:56,858 --> 00:01:00,240
July. We did chapters one through five.

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,982
Now we are in this cohort. So if those

20
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,920
who did not participate in this part,

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,946
thanks for the question, but everyone in

22
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,642
general, respectfully, let's try to have

23
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,798
people who are in the cohort participate

24
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,786
in it. Everyone's welcome to join and of

25
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,426
course rewatch, but contributions and

26
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,014
the questions and the chat are probably

27
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,694
best so that we can respect the people

28
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:24,582
who are continuing on. This is our 14th

29
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,806
meeting and now we're heading into the

30
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:29,722
second five chapters of the book. Okay,

31
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:31,066
does any other person want to give

32
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:32,940
context? Oh, yeah, go ahead.

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,874
The current one that is going on right

34
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:41,786
now is the cohort one and not cohort

35
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,830
two. We are all learning in different

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,206
stages. So the previous hour was the

37
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:50,286
cohort that is focusing on chapters one

38
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:53,022
through five stage they're in. And now

39
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:54,782
some of us, a different set of people,

40
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,786
some are joining both. So that's why we

41
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:59,026
made the meetings convenient, was so

42
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:00,962
that we could like for many of us who

43
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:03,410
want to do both, we can join.

44
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,960
But this is a separate set of people.

45
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,542
I see. Yes. Okay,

46
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:15,080
so cohort two was first and then

47
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,474
this meeting. In this meeting right now,

48
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:20,474
cohort two was first. Yes. And now is

49
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:24,074
cohort one, which started correct. We

50
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:25,546
warmed up with chapters one through

51
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,066
five. Okay, so I

52
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,514
will leave because I subscribe for

53
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,798
cohort two. Excellent. Okay, good.

54
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:37,102
Thank you so much. See you next time.

55
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:40,640
Thanks for setting up all this thing.

56
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,420
Okay, bye bye. Yes. Awesome.

57
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,780
Okay, anyone else want to add anything?

58
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,970
We don't need to do a Coda overview.

59
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,614
I would say people who are watching this

60
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:59,474
recording can look at the live recording

61
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:01,814
if they want a Coda update that we just

62
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:05,094
went through for the cohort two's live

63
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:09,306
meetings. But does anyone want

64
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:12,246
to give any introductory thoughts?

65
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:13,866
Otherwise, there's a few ways I think we

66
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:17,482
can go for this session, but we're here

67
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:21,486
just to rejoin our activities and

68
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:24,160
orient towards chapters six or ten.

69
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,360
We can scan through the chapters, we can

70
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,342
have any suggestions or discussions

71
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:36,318
around ways to approach them. I don't

72
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:36,900
know.

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,150
Rohan and then anyone else?

74
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,968
I was wondering, when are we going to

75
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:59,764
get to the projects part or discussions

76
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:02,040
about the projects? Monetics.

77
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,156
Great question. Let's look at the

78
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,844
chapters and see where that first off,

79
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:12,812
it can happen however you want with

80
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:16,556
contacting people. And we

81
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,764
can make a sub page like I see exists

82
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:21,904
here. This looks really awesome. So

83
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:24,208
people can request a sub page. They can

84
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:28,384
mention it. That contact them now

85
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:31,796
or however. So it's up to you for a

86
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,390
project that is under your control.

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,804
It can be developed in the open here or

88
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:42,228
however, you can also participate in

89
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:46,036
many ongoing projects like active

90
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:49,944
blockfronts, which also which might all

91
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:53,332
share this. Our Gitcoin grant

92
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:57,636
was approved yesterday. So if people are

93
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,644
familiar with this or want to become

94
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,964
familiar, this is a way to provide or

95
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,684
receive support possibly for their

96
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,028
learning in block prints and

97
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,256
contributing to that open source

98
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:08,060
package.

99
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,984
Does that address what you were

100
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,184
thinking? Were you thinking about these

101
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,944
project ideas or were you thinking more

102
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,752
about the sort of build your own model

103
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:20,496
approach that will be starting in

104
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:21,410
chapter six?

105
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,084
No, about the project ideas in the code

106
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,548
of page. That answers my question.

107
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:30,390
Awesome. Yeah.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,916
There are different types of projects.

109
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,476
Clearly more will be added, but they're

110
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:41,064
of different they might

111
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,920
involve building a generative model,

112
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,172
but they are not the generative model

113
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,736
itself. Or only let's

114
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:53,116
look at chapter six because this

115
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:55,308
is where the generative model

116
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:57,500
construction is going to come into play.

117
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,500
And so again, there's a lot of projects

118
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,968
that you would only need to

119
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:03,452
qualitatively think about generative

120
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:06,700
models for, like educational material

121
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,644
production is related to the generative

122
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,076
model or could be modeled as the

123
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,820
generative model of a learner.

124
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,876
But you wouldn't necessarily have to

125
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,504
make a generative model. But in chapter

126
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:18,150
six,

127
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,796
it's a recipe for designing active

128
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:27,384
inference models. It is

129
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:30,520
going to brock. Sorry, just real quick.

130
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,192
I think Lucas here doesn't have access.

131
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:35,850
He asked for access. Okay,

132
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,272
message in discord. Or I mean message

133
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,036
and gather your email address and I'll

134
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:43,870
add you.

135
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,070
Okay,

136
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,272
sorry. Okay, you requested access.

137
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,676
All right, I will add you. That's

138
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,744
enough. Then in

139
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:03,364
chapter Six, it's going to ask some

140
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:08,032
questions that are driving

141
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,230
the design of the generative model.

142
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,928
Which system are we modeling? System of

143
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,440
interest, what is the appropriate form

144
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,656
for the generative model reflecting the

145
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:22,024
discrete or continuous distinction that

146
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:25,400
we looked at? And also all these other

147
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,548
questions that aren't exactly within the

148
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:29,304
textbook, like temporal depth,

149
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,544
hierarchical nesting, which parameters

150
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,564
are learned versus fixed? All these

151
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,144
different directions that the models

152
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:38,352
actually have to be elaborated on even

153
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,844
before getting to the data engineering

154
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,960
and maybe even code implementation.

155
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,708
Just from a structural perspective,

156
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:47,890
what form is it?

157
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,164
How to set up the generative model is

158
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:54,576
where some of those analytical details

159
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:58,240
begin being introduced. Not necessarily

160
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,028
even the program level implementation or

161
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,010
an executable simulation, but like,

162
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,680
okay, we have a preference vector.

163
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,192
Is there two states? Is there some

164
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:13,300
continuous preference distribution?

165
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,268
Whatever it is, what is the actual

166
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,350
details of the generative model?

167
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,188
And then the other side of the

168
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:25,070
coinblanket is the generative process.

169
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
So what are the endogenous dynamics

170
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,536
and the causal mapping with action for

171
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,850
the generative process?

172
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,856
And there's kind of cases where you have

173
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,888
more of a communication setting, active

174
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,756
inference entities on both sides. You

175
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:46,580
could also have more of like a simple,

176
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,300
simple partnering,

177
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,304
like two deterministic programs that

178
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:55,016
send messages to each other. Or it could

179
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,560
be like one more cognitive,

180
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,170
more agent like generative model and one

181
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,880
more environmental nonliving

182
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,750
type.

183
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,116
Any thoughts or overviews? Or how would

184
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:16,524
people think about how can we make this

185
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,712
type of a recipe design? Should we be

186
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,624
all designing a model? Or how do we even

187
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,344
go about reading a section of the book

188
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:29,452
in a chapter that begins with a recipe

189
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:33,430
provision? Lyle yeah,

190
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,436
I spent a lot of time building what I

191
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,636
think would be classed here as

192
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:41,284
generative models. And what I find is

193
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:45,092
that I characterize it as the step

194
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:48,920
of framing up is

195
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,752
often far trickier, sometimes much

196
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:54,120
harder, frankly, than building a model,

197
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,428
depending on what the situation is.

198
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:59,836
And in my experience, I find that it all

199
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,270
comes down to making sure we understand

200
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,884
what is the question that we're trying

201
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:10,396
to answer. It's sort of like because

202
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,268
every modeling process I'm sure

203
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:14,976
everybody on this call knows is a

204
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,232
process of deciding what to leave out,

205
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,312
right? What to put in, what to leave

206
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:22,180
out, and what level of representation.

207
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,268
Then everything that's in there,

208
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,476
if it's going to be a good model, has to

209
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:31,510
be necessary and necessary to

210
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,616
answer a question or provide a

211
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:37,416
particular insight or so forth. So that

212
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:41,112
whole issue of framing out what

213
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:44,552
you're going to build in all those

214
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,416
different the 10,000 questions, there's

215
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:50,030
more than four. Ultimately it's many.

216
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,340
Then it's all about that, which often

217
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,476
means understanding the audience. If the

218
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,764
model builder is the only audience,

219
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,770
this is much simpler. If the audience is

220
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,072
some much larger group with different

221
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,024
perspectives, a lack of homogeneity

222
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:15,876
and insight, then there almost has to

223
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:19,572
be, I'm going to say almost a pre

224
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:23,880
modeling or framing process of sort of

225
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,184
framing up. What are the questions we

226
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,570
care about? And then we can talk about

227
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,276
how those translate into a model that's

228
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,940
just some general framing.

229
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,924
Thank you. That's very interesting.

230
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:44,520
It makes me think about this audience

231
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,868
question for the model. Like, why are we

232
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:48,408
building the model? Why are we shaping

233
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,904
our regime of attention to build this

234
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,504
model? Model building can be an end

235
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,584
of itself. It can be creative and

236
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,584
expressive and fun and all these other

237
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:00,112
things. And maybe later there's a road

238
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,496
that has some Pragmatic value too. But

239
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,724
also it can just be like fun. Like,

240
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,484
what would a generative model that could

241
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:09,188
do this look like? And that can be very

242
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:12,196
didactic there's other times where

243
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:14,468
you're presenting information, oh, I

244
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,396
made a simulation of Twitter discourse

245
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:19,848
and dot dot, dot is always going to

246
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,704
be presented in a way that's not only

247
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,064
just like, the model distilling down

248
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,836
from the world, but then you're

249
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,952
communicating it. And then when you're

250
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,036
actually not just communicating, but if

251
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:30,764
you're making an application that does

252
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,604
something and communication is doing

253
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:36,492
something as well, then the system

254
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:39,328
of interest, as Lyle mentioned,

255
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,856
is totally nontrivial. And there's the

256
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:45,072
whole framing in some of these early

257
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:46,988
stages, especially because they can't

258
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,010
always be changed easily later.

259
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,430
Rowan and then anyone else.

260
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,780
Yeah, so I'm just curious, when you say

261
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,140
who's the audience,

262
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,372
isn't this part of the active inference

263
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:11,048
model itself? That okay, so whatever

264
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,068
makes sense in that framework, wouldn't

265
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,530
that be the audience here?

266
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,984
It has to survive, right? Your agent has

267
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,290
to survive. So whatever generative model

268
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,850
helps it survive, would that not be the

269
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,788
it's model of choice over here? And I'm

270
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:35,136
just curious. I'm not sure it's an

271
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:39,152
awesome way to frame it, and maybe

272
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:41,140
someone can share the free energy

273
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,436
governance link in the chat. I just

274
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,924
can't look it up right now. But it

275
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:50,804
puts this very nicely in a recent pretty

276
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:54,120
short book dissertation about that

277
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,280
imperative for organizations.

278
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,344
And yes, in one sense it can be said

279
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,136
the right generative model or like the

280
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,784
audience for it is whatever its

281
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,690
survivability conditions are.

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,684
And within our textbook group, the

283
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,470
survivability conditions are open.

284
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,092
However, we're also learning about or

285
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,610
even just gesturing towards like,

286
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,944
okay, not just we're going to imagine a

287
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:29,296
room with a person who can take on a

288
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:33,124
jacket or take it off. We can make that

289
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,268
a didactic model. And the audience could

290
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,176
be this textbook group or future cohorts

291
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,036
of the textbook group, and the function

292
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:44,280
could be just sort of like a neutral

293
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,012
exemplar active inference generative

294
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:50,984
model. But then, of course, the

295
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,536
considerations for information

296
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:55,400
presentation, empirical data analysis,

297
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,796
any kind of application, the system of

298
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,036
interest is not just the one person with

299
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,772
the jacket on or off two states room

300
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:07,068
with a sign fluctuation. So that's a

301
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,944
different situation for model building.

302
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:12,320
So how should we interpret this recipe?

303
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,624
Okay, but is there

304
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:22,448
not like, a general framework

305
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:25,364
for what a good generative model looks

306
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,276
like is what I'm saying. I guess you

307
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,628
could frame that differently. So if you

308
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:31,972
want to build pixel level

309
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:33,808
representations, for example, you can

310
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:37,124
use a gan, and that's a pretty decent

311
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,952
one, but maybe pixel level

312
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:43,144
representations are not good

313
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:44,856
for the task at hand or something like

314
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:48,268
that. So it should fit a general

315
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:51,004
category. Right? So this is what a good

316
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,048
set of models looks like for active

317
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,790
inference. So that's sort of getting at.

318
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,516
Yeah, that's a very fascinating framing.

319
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:01,584
Does anyone want to add something to

320
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:02,210
that?

321
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,648
I totally hear you on is there

322
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:12,532
a rubric like, what are we evaluating

323
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:17,230
the generative model and process fit?

324
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,004
Because it's not like there's just

325
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,396
simply a best generative model bigger or

326
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:25,496
whatever. No feature about it except

327
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,150
outside of a generative process.

328
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,792
Context is the fitness and then

329
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,356
what? Is there a rubric? Is there a gold

330
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:35,036
standard? Is it like, oh, you're dealing

331
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,600
with audio data here's, the file format,

332
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,664
that level of standardization?

333
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:44,004
Certainly not. However, are there some

334
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:47,124
practices or lenses that we could bring

335
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:49,492
in from people's experience with

336
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:53,240
evaluating model adequacy and relevancy?

337
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,624
There probably are. Lyle well,

338
00:16:57,662 --> 00:17:00,232
yeah, that really comes right back to

339
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,364
purpose, right. So a model is always fit

340
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,380
for purpose.

341
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,516
Of course, this also surfaces the

342
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:11,468
questions of model validation, right.

343
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:12,684
One of the things we haven't talked

344
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:15,230
about here is what's the right model?

345
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,692
How do we frame up the right model?

346
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,296
What do we choose to put in what we

347
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,332
leave out? Part of that is purpose.

348
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:25,488
And how would I evaluate if I do what

349
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,016
I'm imagining a model will be? How do I

350
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,992
evaluate its quality, its validity?

351
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:33,300
Well, what data is actually available?

352
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,700
That's one thing you always have to ask

353
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,004
at the outset what data is available?

354
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,096
What data can I use? What's

355
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:43,028
computationally adequate?

356
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:47,400
And what parts of this then when we

357
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,744
kind of project, when we apply

358
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:53,530
this model, if that's its role, then

359
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,916
does it fit for the purpose? Does it

360
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,844
provide good, adequate results and

361
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:02,044
improve whatever behavior we're trying

362
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:02,830
to address?

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,668
You can't say if it's good if you don't

364
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,896
have a purpose. So if your purpose is

365
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,104
just to explore model building, which is

366
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:16,576
something I love to do, then that's a

367
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:19,636
pretty big there's a lot of things that

368
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:22,084
are fit for that purpose, right? But if

369
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:27,684
the purpose is to do

370
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:31,784
a prospective analysis of a system and

371
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:33,464
what actions might be taken to

372
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,352
intervene, then that's in a different

373
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,010
thing.

374
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,850
Thanks a lot for sharing it. I'm really

375
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,348
happy. And I think it's relevant that

376
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:46,424
we're having this kind of a discussion

377
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:49,836
because we've gone through some of the

378
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:52,780
first chapters and we'll continue

379
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,844
through chapter six, I think, in having

380
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:58,416
this conversation. But does anybody else

381
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,304
want to add something about this more

382
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:02,290
general topic of, like,

383
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,112
how are we even coming to talk about

384
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,636
what system, or how are we framing the

385
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:15,006
system that we're modeling that's

386
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:16,660
in Section 6.3?

387
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,306
This is too broad. It's not active

388
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:27,346
inference specific. But whenever I'm

389
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:29,302
trying to model something, the only

390
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:31,410
questions that I mean, it is contextual

391
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,246
to the purpose. It entails a purpose in

392
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:36,538
an audience. But all I want to know

393
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:41,194
basically is what are the questions that

394
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,962
this model needs to generate an answer

395
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,782
for? What is the

396
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:50,810
information that is necessarily,

397
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:56,542
therefore kind of required to model

398
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,734
a system that would have such answers in

399
00:19:58,772 --> 00:19:59,360
it?

400
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,314
And maybe another way to say the same

401
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:09,586
thing is like, what affordances would

402
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,720
the model require to

403
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,686
answer, address whatever, some set

404
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,190
of questions that are posed to system?

405
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,920
So if you asked,

406
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,360
I don't know,

407
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,334
how frequently does a yellow colored

408
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:31,354
car, I don't know drive down this

409
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:32,460
particular road,

410
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,526
then I wouldn't need to record the

411
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:42,400
number of bikes or their colors that are

412
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,418
using the bike lane or buses or trucks

413
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:50,682
large. This is maybe

414
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,978
outside the scope of what I mean by

415
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:56,862
yellow. How many cars

416
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,526
out of all the cars, how many are yellow

417
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,818
or something driving down this road or

418
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:04,820
whatever, like not

419
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,646
even exactly a generative model. But my

420
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:10,470
my point is that modeling that system

421
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,322
there, there is obvious data that's

422
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:15,480
completely irrelevant, right? And so

423
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,706
if you were going to build some sort of

424
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,178
simulation of any kind that's going to

425
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,726
be generative like there's

426
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:26,426
often a lot of data that's just

427
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,254
completely extraneous depending on what

428
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,240
questions you're going to ask of it.

429
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,920
Thanks. In 63

430
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,730
in the first paragraphs they're going to

431
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,942
come out hard on the interface concept

432
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:48,434
of Markov blanket. This is how you'll do

433
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:51,422
system modeling is by finding interfaces

434
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,494
that distinguish the internal and

435
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:58,120
external states of a system. Then that

436
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,630
is critiqued or elaborated because

437
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,358
there's in infinite degrees of freedom

438
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:08,074
in the course gradings and those are

439
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:12,026
modeler specific and

440
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,734
they suggest that that matters.

441
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:16,246
Especially if you want to be considering

442
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:20,286
embodied extended perspectives where

443
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:24,074
just descriptive interfacing

444
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:26,720
models won't give you the whole answer.

445
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,926
There's a great paper could a

446
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,458
neuroscientist understand a

447
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:33,218
microprocessor showing that even if you

448
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,406
have total access to the microprocessors

449
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:39,650
firing like an EEG and a generated set

450
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,086
of single and double lesions, a lot of

451
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,186
the interpretations would be strongly

452
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:48,786
misleading. Yet people want the wiring

453
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,834
circuit of the brain which is dynamic

454
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,266
and also involves diffusive molecules.

455
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:57,094
We have all 302 nematode neurons

456
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,566
mapped but that also as an interface

457
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:04,218
diagram is not even close. So if

458
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:05,706
you want to describe the nematode like

459
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,206
model building then it's a fit for

460
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:10,814
purpose. However, there might be very

461
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:13,934
simple models that could be doing a lot

462
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:19,230
better in nematode behavior observation.

463
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,074
The form is discussed. There are three

464
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,066
main design choices. First, discrete and

465
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,050
continuous time. We had some awesome

466
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,418
discussions in the previous months about

467
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:35,622
similarities and differences and where

468
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,006
in theory they're different and then in

469
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:40,806
practice where they're different. The

470
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,562
whole question of discretizing

471
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:46,086
continuous systems. The second choice

472
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:48,682
is between shallow models and

473
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,886
hierarchical models where inference

474
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:54,106
operates at multiple timescales. The

475
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:56,474
third choice is the consideration only

476
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:59,306
of the present kind of the variational

477
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,266
free energy versus models with temporal

478
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:05,130
depth. Temporal depth consideration

479
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,654
could be purely passive and it could

480
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:13,410
also include some element of affordance

481
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,074
which if we remember to like the B

482
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:19,938
matrix actions are influencing how

483
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:22,594
states of the world are changing through

484
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:26,146
time. So that is how active inference

485
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:30,402
is unifying. Policy comparison

486
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:33,160
by kind of embedding action into

487
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,086
estimates of how things could evolve

488
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:37,210
probabilistically.

489
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,074
Those three design decisions are

490
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,138
explored in slightly more detail in the

491
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:48,102
subsections 65. How to set up

492
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:51,102
the generative model after

493
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,398
specification. Then the specific

494
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:58,222
variables have to be included. Okay,

495
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,238
the latent state temperature is going to

496
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:02,706
be continuous. The observations in my

497
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:05,122
thermometer I'm going to take in as just

498
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:07,506
integers. And then there's going to be a

499
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:10,830
person who is going to be in a binary

500
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,574
state of like whether it's hot or cold,

501
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:16,618
or maybe I want hot, neutral and cold.

502
00:25:16,654 --> 00:25:18,134
Or maybe I want them to have a ten point

503
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:20,802
scale or I want them to have a scale

504
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:24,374
that's doing dot, dot, dot that is in

505
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:27,114
this stage of actually setting up the

506
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:30,618
generative model and giving a

507
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,410
little bit of color to

508
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,150
what had been just outlined.

509
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,934
It's going to be a nested model with

510
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,566
this continuous variable. And this kind

511
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:44,910
of a discrete variable.

512
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,034
Here we return to the frog example from

513
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:55,218
earlier in the book where there's like

514
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,218
but it's kind of being generalized a

515
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,186
little bit. It was introduced with the

516
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,902
whole Bayesian equation walkthrough.

517
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:03,782
Now we're returning to it and thinking

518
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:07,206
more about multimodal or like even you

519
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,426
could consider this as sensor fusion

520
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:13,046
because there's some hidden cause, the

521
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:16,154
jumping or the action of a frog that is

522
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,980
inducing several domains of

523
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,822
impact potentially in the generative

524
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:26,538
process. And then that leads to specific

525
00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:29,950
observables from the perspective of

526
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,566
the cognitive entity. Those could be

527
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:35,514
again, two communicative cognitive

528
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:39,726
entities or one and not or however so

529
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:41,746
this is like, okay, we're going to be

530
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,958
modeling forest fires.

531
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,706
So forest fires, they change the

532
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:49,534
temperature, they change the chemical

533
00:26:49,582 --> 00:26:52,814
composition, they change the vibrations

534
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,906
in the ground or something. Okay, and

535
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:57,526
then maybe there's three sensors, maybe

536
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,734
you have three thermometers. And then

537
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:00,838
what about them? Are you going to

538
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:02,934
average them? Are they going to be like

539
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:05,510
three parallel modeled time series?

540
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,446
That is where some more specification

541
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:11,660
of the generative model comes into play.

542
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,794
Keeping the active inference ontology in

543
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:19,198
mind. What are the affordances of the

544
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,686
frog? What are the latent states that

545
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,622
are being changing through time like

546
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,746
sound, physical presence or photon

547
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:30,866
emission or something? And then what are

548
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:32,546
the data? That would be the O, the

549
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,410
observations.

550
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,698
This box looks like it's about different

551
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,458
sensory modalities. I'm sure there's a

552
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:44,214
lot of interesting discussions we could

553
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,720
bring in here.

554
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,690
Priors and empirical behavior complete

555
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,290
class theorems. Any statistical decision

556
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,774
procedure behavior may be framed as

557
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:04,326
Bayes optimal under the right set of

558
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:05,430
prior beliefs.

559
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,034
Discussion of fixed and learned

560
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:16,338
variables one can imagine the pros and

561
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:19,154
the cons generally of having fixed and

562
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:23,438
learned variables. Like computationally

563
00:28:23,454 --> 00:28:25,746
it's simpler to fix hard code a

564
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:28,642
variable. However, if there's a setting

565
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,174
where the model's adequacy depends on

566
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:33,638
being able to update that, maybe you

567
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,278
want it learnable. However, then you

568
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:37,846
have to deal with these questions about

569
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:41,206
the kinetics of learning like instantly

570
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:43,750
switch or slow switch or trend

571
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,106
averaging. So there's a lot of

572
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:47,674
discussions around learning how is

573
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:50,726
attention regulated, what is precision

574
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:52,942
on learning? It's like it very much

575
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:56,878
complexifies the model and there's many

576
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:59,918
variables that you can bring into a

577
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:03,826
learnable setting. But when

578
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:07,442
it's framed as just static variables and

579
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,326
only like the hidden states changing

580
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:11,374
through time. That's like the simplest

581
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:15,022
case. But more and more cognitive

582
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,590
entities probably are going to entail

583
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,070
considering learning dynamics,

584
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,280
setting up the generative process.

585
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,018
The reason we postponed the design of

586
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:34,394
the generative process so little

587
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:37,850
slate of hands entity first,

588
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,546
not the niche first is that in

589
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:43,338
many practical applications discussed in

590
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:45,114
this book, we simply assume the dynamics

591
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,654
of the generative process are the same

592
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,440
or very similar to the generative model.

593
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,498
We generally assume the agent's

594
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:53,086
generative model closely mimics the

595
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:55,170
process that generates its observation.

596
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,500
That is clearly a simplifying case

597
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,826
because it doesn't address what

598
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:09,670
if you're paying attention to predicting

599
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,934
width and the world is dependent on

600
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:16,854
height. There's so many complexities of

601
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:18,954
that which is really that broader. Like

602
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,030
what is being modeled, what matters

603
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,700
question but in some

604
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,114
way very upstream or very close to the

605
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:32,026
stream, it is like the rabbit being put

606
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:35,646
in the hat. Like if the rat knows that

607
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,926
there's a five x five maze, that's a

608
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:41,614
huge amount of information versus if it

609
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,258
only has access to pure local

610
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:47,874
information. And that's just something

611
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,594
to, I think, for us to note as we look

612
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,746
through models. Like are we modeling the

613
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,638
generative process? Oh, so the seasons

614
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,686
oscillate. So it is a sine wave. So then

615
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,174
the generative model of the agent is

616
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,350
also going to be fitting a sine wave.

617
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,934
Well, then it kind of collapses to like

618
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:10,554
a stochastic regression and maybe

619
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,938
then it looks like the fit is going to

620
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:13,980
be very good.

621
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,866
Active inference modeling brings in

622
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,862
another complexity with action

623
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:23,920
influencing outcomes that prevents some,

624
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,534
I guess, fallacies of modeling, but by

625
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,614
no means and probably introduces many

626
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:34,990
others. Eric? Yeah.

627
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,762
Can you hear me? This is a new sounds

628
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:41,410
good. So this might be a time to discuss

629
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,738
the question I posted and I apologize I

630
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:46,966
didn't put it in the right place the

631
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,366
other day. I just figured out today that

632
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:51,122
it goes under this particular location.

633
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:55,478
But this is about the question about why

634
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,622
modeling of a generative process is

635
00:31:57,676 --> 00:32:00,294
necessary, is a necessary step for

636
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:02,246
building an active inference model. So

637
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:04,906
let me just read it because it's a lot

638
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:08,006
of words. So we know that an active

639
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:09,606
inference agent employs a generative

640
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,566
model as its model of the external world

641
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,646
and it uses this generative model to

642
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:16,266
perform inferences about perceptual

643
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:18,062
input and to make decisions about

644
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,826
actions. So in general, the external

645
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:25,470
world is complex and unknowable to the

646
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,194
agent. The generative model may or may

647
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:31,714
not be able to learn. But if it is

648
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:33,266
learning is supposed to put the

649
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:34,846
generative model in a better alignment

650
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,466
with the world's generative process,

651
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,542
whatever that may be. So I can see how

652
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:41,640
one might model the generative process

653
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,062
if one is building an artificial agent

654
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:47,062
in a laboratory where you kind of have

655
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:50,214
access, you control how the world

656
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,442
behaves with respect to the agent. And

657
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:53,946
then you might want to study how well

658
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:57,734
the agent design works versus one versus

659
00:32:57,782 --> 00:33:00,042
another under control conditions. But

660
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:01,626
this is not the same as designing an

661
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,274
agent to go out and cope with some real

662
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:05,018
world environment where you really don't

663
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:07,406
know what the generative process is. So

664
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,246
I think that the recipe for designing an

665
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:11,994
active inference models would include

666
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,482
formally setting up the generative

667
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:15,326
process only in the kind of the

668
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:17,346
laboratory situation, but not if you're

669
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:19,538
really trying to build something out for

670
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,794
the real world because you don't know

671
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,954
the generative process. You might create

672
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,506
an artificial laboratory kind of

673
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:27,954
situation by trying to build a model of

674
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:29,598
how the world works and say, well, how

675
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:31,654
does my agent work under those

676
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:35,558
assumptions or not? But that might

677
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,158
set you up for putting the agent in the

678
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,010
real world. But in fact, you don't know

679
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,906
the generative process if you're really

680
00:33:40,928 --> 00:33:42,746
trying to build something to work in the

681
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:45,946
real world. That's my comment, my

682
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:47,260
question. That's your question.

683
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,120
Thank you, Lyle. Well,

684
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,126
Eric, I love that framing because I

685
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,802
think there's multiple different cases,

686
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:02,458
right? So I think if you're modeling

687
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:06,114
something that, as you say, goes in the

688
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:10,914
real world, then perhaps it's some

689
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:13,380
sentient creature or being,

690
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,558
then obviously the real world,

691
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:22,454
even if we knew everything about it, is

692
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:26,578
too complex to model. Right. So that's

693
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:28,954
fool's gold to assume you know

694
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,980
everything, right?

695
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,486
I'm just going to say, yeah, that's

696
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,922
hard. Typically, I guess we would say

697
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:38,710
what are the parts of the generative,

698
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,158
the real world, the generative process

699
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:44,522
that we're going to consider relevant

700
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,702
and deal with that and knowing that

701
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,926
we're making a leap of faith. But

702
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:52,382
there's another case, I think, which is

703
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:55,022
more generalizable, just complex

704
00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:58,306
adaptive systems that operate in what I

705
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:02,914
call the built world. So I

706
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:04,722
work with a bunch of people who build

707
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:07,762
digital twins. They build digital twins

708
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:10,710
of human infrastructure,

709
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,454
so buildings and all this stuff there.

710
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:16,402
The generative process that we're

711
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:20,970
concerned with is largely knowable and

712
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,690
largely representable.

713
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,906
What's interesting about that is there

714
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:30,858
are a bunch of blind spots and

715
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,486
inadequacies in what we know about that

716
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:36,414
generative process and the ability to do

717
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:39,006
inference about what the real state of

718
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:42,206
that system is then becomes the value of

719
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,086
this approach in that setting.

720
00:35:45,198 --> 00:35:48,866
Right. I don't think

721
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:50,658
there's a general answer. Once again, I

722
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:52,142
think it really comes down to purpose

723
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,158
and what the specific framing you're

724
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:57,414
looking to do? To me, this ability to

725
00:35:57,452 --> 00:35:59,286
say something about what I I like that

726
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:01,046
idea of decision agents, right.

727
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:04,342
Decision agents that are going to

728
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:07,190
potentially take action or infer actual

729
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,778
states is much richer than what a lot of

730
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:14,026
the historical modeling paradigms have

731
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,714
given us. So I think that's really

732
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:20,410
interesting. Thank you, Lyle. Ali.

733
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,718
Also think that the distinction between

734
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,630
generative process and generative models

735
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,866
become significant if we want to

736
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:41,618
simulate learning rather than just

737
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:45,154
inference. I mean, that's the answer

738
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:48,262
I got from Ryan Smith because I asked

739
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:51,046
him almost the same question. Why do we

740
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:53,560
need generative process in order to

741
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,894
simulate the agents? Because,

742
00:36:58,012 --> 00:37:01,100
you see, for the generative process,

743
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,886
if the generative model exactly maps

744
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:11,078
them to generative process, we only need

745
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,858
that capital D matrix, right? And that's

746
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,466
just when we're just trying to simulate

747
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:20,318
the inference side of the agent, right?

748
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,102
But when the learning comes along, then

749
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:26,834
we need to separate that capital D

750
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:31,282
from another matrix, probably dill case

751
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:35,150
D, which maps into the generator

752
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,034
process. So yeah, one of the situations

753
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:40,422
that the distinction between two might

754
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:44,934
be necessary is when

755
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,302
those two process, I mean learning and

756
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,214
inference, are taken as two separate

757
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:51,820
phenomena to model.

758
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,082
Thanks. One note is

759
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:59,946
also there's work on symmetries in the

760
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:01,710
generative process, generative model,

761
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,738
like, I think like the bi directional

762
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:08,346
paper with Matt Sims and Blue discussing

763
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:11,742
it. And then here

764
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:15,854
will be a defense to Eric's excellent

765
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:16,500
question.

766
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,970
The entity first modeling approach

767
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,930
that's taken by this chapter,

768
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,386
one can say, I don't know whether I'm

769
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:31,458
going to a forest or a desert, but I'm

770
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:34,822
going to have these sensors on my

771
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:38,054
designed interface and I'm going

772
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,570
to do extensive modeling on

773
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,186
interoception and homeostasis. And if

774
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,214
I can learn policies that balance

775
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:49,530
homeostasis, then I've survived.

776
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,660
If I fail, then failure happens.

777
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,966
So that doesn't mean that it works or

778
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:57,006
it's doing the right thing, fit for

779
00:38:57,028 --> 00:39:00,094
purpose, any of those aspects. But one

780
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:03,466
of the insights from the four E and the

781
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,594
embodied side is like a vast amount of

782
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:11,502
our what is modelable as cognitive isn't

783
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:14,930
necessarily the declarative.

784
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:20,002
I think, therefore I am possibly

785
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,746
even symbolic type thinking linguistic.

786
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:27,142
There's a lot going on and many

787
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:31,014
of that a lot going on can be simplified

788
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:33,606
by not even knowing about the external

789
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,406
process, maybe not even the as modeled

790
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,854
kidney knowing about what the as modeled

791
00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:42,574
liver is doing. So this

792
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:43,898
type of a focus where it's like we're

793
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:51,834
going to define our

794
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:56,334
entity types and

795
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:58,334
the kinds of observations that they can

796
00:39:58,372 --> 00:40:00,494
make, the kinds of affordances that they

797
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,942
have or do empirically or that they

798
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:04,480
conceptually could do.

799
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,762
That approach is

800
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:13,454
consistent with embodied biological

801
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:15,234
systems and persistence of

802
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:18,498
organizations. And so

803
00:40:18,664 --> 00:40:20,562
I'm wondering how that piece comes into

804
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:22,066
play with this discussion that's very

805
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:26,002
important about and also their earlier

806
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,666
discussion of the embedded and extended

807
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:30,166
cognition is that it kind of blurs the

808
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:32,582
line with what is a generative model,

809
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:36,454
what is a generative process. So hence

810
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:40,138
there being a lot of thinking

811
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:43,494
and attention on what the system's

812
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:47,018
modeling is. What are the known unknowns

813
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:48,880
and the unknown unknowns going to be.

814
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,826
Let's just see how the chapter

815
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:53,550
ends.

816
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,736
Six, seven simulating, visualizing,

817
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:01,856
analyzing, and fitting data using active

818
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:05,504
inference. So standard routines

819
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:07,172
for active inference that provide

820
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:09,190
support for all functions are available.

821
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,610
Hashtag SPM and Appendix C

822
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,352
step by Step model is a great look

823
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:21,770
through this. This is MATLAB code one

824
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,944
amazing work that we could all iterate

825
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:31,164
on. Would be porting MATLAB into

826
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,396
the ontology into Python and

827
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:36,488
or Julia with Pi MDP or active

828
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:39,852
blockference. But there's a lot

829
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:41,884
in SPM and some of it's neuroimaging

830
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,844
specific, some of it's very variational

831
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:47,568
base specific. Not all of it is going to

832
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:50,656
be state of the art or the most useful

833
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,790
in every situation. However,

834
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,852
I wonder if only offering certain

835
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:59,636
routines in MATLAB, which is like a

836
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:02,724
traditionally very academic software

837
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:05,610
platform and potentially non free,

838
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,792
can be a limiting factor. So those

839
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:13,800
who feel like they want to learn more or

840
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:18,728
contribute this way helping structure

841
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,844
some of the code architecture so that

842
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:26,396
cohorts coming through can be doing

843
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:28,256
multiple language. Maybe first we can

844
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:30,256
just move some of these routines into a

845
00:42:30,278 --> 00:42:33,456
folder and then people can start to

846
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:36,480
organize those types of aspects.

847
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,360
Summary it's a four step recipe.

848
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,156
We walk through it from the

849
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:45,140
consideration of the system of interest

850
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,964
broadly, like the entity and the

851
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:49,232
process, focusing in on the entity

852
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:51,732
specifically thinking structurally about

853
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:53,690
what it is going to be like doing

854
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,416
composed of specifying that to a few

855
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:59,912
levels of detail, then doing the same

856
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,440
for the generative process. And then

857
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,692
once that is specified, it's not quite,

858
00:43:05,746 --> 00:43:08,620
quite there for most people today,

859
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,460
but where it seems like

860
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,132
they are laying out a path towards and

861
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:19,008
where we probably can and will be after

862
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:22,400
that level of setup. In some

863
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,976
potentially graphical editor or

864
00:43:25,078 --> 00:43:27,810
parameter file. Then,

865
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,284
as SPM and MATLAB have done in many,

866
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:35,492
many papers, the generative model

867
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,724
specification almost prepares the

868
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:41,316
working script. But there's still a lot

869
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:43,044
of details and pieces to add in,

870
00:43:43,082 --> 00:43:45,204
especially in a modern environment and

871
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,844
for all of these non standard and novel

872
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,256
cases that people are wanting to

873
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:52,264
consider. But that is once we have a

874
00:43:52,302 --> 00:43:54,608
notebook that goes through the recipe,

875
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:57,660
then the recipes can be forked and so on

876
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,924
and they can be written in different

877
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:01,692
languages, pi MDP, block for instance.

878
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:05,660
Ali. Yeah,

879
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,864
just one thing that I think is not made

880
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:12,080
explicit in this chapter is that

881
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,528
actually that first step, which system

882
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:16,912
are we modeling? Especially the

883
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:18,924
identification of the markup blanket

884
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:22,532
part is basically at this point of

885
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:27,044
active inference research is more like

886
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:32,696
a hypothetical step because I

887
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:35,976
also had the misapprehension that we can

888
00:44:36,078 --> 00:44:39,252
somehow identify the markup

889
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:43,064
blankets from data. But then as

890
00:44:43,102 --> 00:44:46,412
I went on through my project and by

891
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:50,140
consulting Maxwell and others actually

892
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,580
this is the comment Maxwell made about

893
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,484
my proposal that he said that

894
00:44:55,522 --> 00:44:58,944
identifying markup blanket from data is

895
00:44:58,982 --> 00:45:02,450
still an outstanding issue that

896
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,360
is not resolved yet in the research

897
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,640
on active inference. And one of the most

898
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,536
active areas, areas of research they're

899
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:16,724
doing at Versus Lab is just focused on

900
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:20,950
this part of the modeling recipe. I mean

901
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,524
how we can identify,

902
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:27,160
automatically identify or somehow learn

903
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,672
the markup blanket from just pure data

904
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:33,192
points. Awesome. And that

905
00:45:33,246 --> 00:45:35,836
ties in with Dalton s's work on the

906
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,864
blanket index and like continuous

907
00:45:37,912 --> 00:45:40,652
variables for dynamic assemblies of

908
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:44,316
blanketing. This is going

909
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:47,696
to get really nuanced and

910
00:45:47,718 --> 00:45:51,372
empirical with the discovery

911
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:53,724
and the thresholding of Markov blankets

912
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:55,392
and causal inference in real world

913
00:45:55,446 --> 00:45:56,976
systems with many different kinds of

914
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:59,520
sensors and doing structure learning on

915
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,436
generative model and process and like

916
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:04,596
everything empirically. Which is why,

917
00:46:04,698 --> 00:46:06,230
as a simplifying step,

918
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,524
it actually really reminds me of how

919
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:14,120
Dave Snowden situates the difference

920
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,084
between systems thinking and complexity

921
00:46:16,132 --> 00:46:18,996
thinking. Which is systems often uses,

922
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:21,384
like, a lot of nodes and flowcharts to

923
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:22,984
represent system elements and

924
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:25,740
relationships and interfaces,

925
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,680
whereas in complexity and the Knevin

926
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,084
especially framing, it's more

927
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:36,940
like self organizing sand dunes.

928
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,864
And so causal relationships might

929
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:44,480
be very much in flux and it puts a

930
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:47,504
higher focus on action rather than

931
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:50,036
system description, especially in

932
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,924
situations like moving your head where

933
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:55,204
the relationship of different things is

934
00:46:55,242 --> 00:46:58,180
going to be heavily action dependent.

935
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,796
And so for now, we're kind of in the

936
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:05,308
systems world where it's like a priori,

937
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:08,600
here are the system interfaces and then

938
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,888
we're going to take whether it's a

939
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,148
heuristic or whether you take a literal

940
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,944
interpretation, but you don't have to.

941
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:16,088
You could just say I'm taking

942
00:47:16,174 --> 00:47:19,224
heuristically the approach of the

943
00:47:19,262 --> 00:47:22,764
system's mapping. But that's not

944
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:25,276
to say that that generative model

945
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:29,436
couldn't be trained in a systems mapped

946
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:32,752
context and then placed into

947
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:35,888
a different setting where there was a

948
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,724
mismatch or a different generative

949
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,348
model. And so it's going

950
00:47:41,354 --> 00:47:44,196
to be an ongoing discussion. When are

951
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:46,804
these lines drawn? One other point,

952
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:50,016
other than not needing to use last names

953
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:52,180
to refer to specific concepts,

954
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,500
like are we talking about the blanket

955
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,050
that statistically insulates every

956
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,876
partition of nodes in these Bayes

957
00:48:01,908 --> 00:48:05,292
graphs, which are going to be vast? As

958
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:08,156
Ali and Yaakov and I were discussing on

959
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:11,950
the branching time active inference from

960
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,244
just a few days ago yesterday, these

961
00:48:15,282 --> 00:48:18,396
graphs are going to be vast. And so

962
00:48:18,498 --> 00:48:20,188
just saying there will be a Markov

963
00:48:20,204 --> 00:48:21,440
blanket. In fact, there will be many

964
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,044
Markov blankets with different semantics

965
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,890
that you might assign to them or not.

966
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,132
How does that map onto the real world?

967
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:33,216
Is like the realism, instrumentalism,

968
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:36,916
pragmatism abduction conversation that

969
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:40,004
we've been having? Do you come in with

970
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,540
these kinds of boundaries,

971
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,156
heuristically and distinctions or

972
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:50,928
how many levels of uncertainty and

973
00:48:50,954 --> 00:48:52,792
nesting? I don't know how many

974
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,888
categories of blank there are. I don't

975
00:48:55,924 --> 00:48:58,104
know if it's a category or a continuum

976
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:01,772
of this. You can actually still

977
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,896
take on multiple levels of uncertainty

978
00:49:03,928 --> 00:49:06,428
in the modeling, but then fitting it

979
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:08,624
with empirical data, if it's fit for

980
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:10,816
purpose use is to do some sort of

981
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:12,448
statistical inference or like provide

982
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:16,224
meaning or action, but just

983
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:19,004
didactically. When the model's purpose

984
00:49:19,052 --> 00:49:21,408
is educational, then there's a lot of

985
00:49:21,414 --> 00:49:23,044
things and architectures we might play

986
00:49:23,082 --> 00:49:26,516
with and then the

987
00:49:26,538 --> 00:49:30,020
recipe. And also this conversation

988
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,976
helps, I hope, hold space for the

989
00:49:35,998 --> 00:49:37,716
educational and the curiosity driven

990
00:49:37,748 --> 00:49:39,128
model development where we're going to

991
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:42,520
have a lot of fun and interesting GMs

992
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,180
and people's applications

993
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,556
and working with different real world

994
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:54,124
constraints and different

995
00:49:54,162 --> 00:49:56,396
settings. We'll all be learning a lot

996
00:49:56,578 --> 00:49:59,824
from it, and hopefully some of it will

997
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:03,200
be in repos we can reference.

998
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,216
Other people may want to play around and

999
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,044
version within folders that we can make

1000
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:13,284
if anybody wants to be added as a

1001
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:16,528
collaborator in this textbook

1002
00:50:16,704 --> 00:50:20,500
repo, which is just pretty much empty

1003
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,696
except for, I guess, a script from

1004
00:50:24,718 --> 00:50:25,560
Yaakup.

1005
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,490
And there'll be more to say on probably

1006
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,368
GitHub. And as we continue

1007
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:36,812
through. But in these last minutes,

1008
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:40,316
does anyone have any thoughts for our

1009
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,700
continuation of the cohort?

1010
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,024
I have one question. Daniel, you

1011
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:50,784
referenced a paper earlier in the

1012
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:53,888
discussion that I'd love to

1013
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:56,924
get the reference to about persistence

1014
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,904
of organizations and survivability. Oh,

1015
00:50:59,942 --> 00:51:00,530
yes.

1016
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,270
All right. I will put it into

1017
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,520
resources.

1018
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,410
Here's the work.

1019
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,636
It's a PhD dissertation that was

1020
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:28,892
published as a book, and I'll upload the

1021
00:51:28,946 --> 00:51:32,200
PDF as well. This is extremely

1022
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,510
interesting work.

1023
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:49,030
Yeah, it just came out and and okay,

1024
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,940
in our last minutes, it's it's too, too

1025
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,190
fun not to share.

1026
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,800
So Karl Friston has written a

1027
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:01,480
foreword.

1028
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,796
What is a firm's purpose? What is an

1029
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:08,956
organization's purpose? It's as

1030
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:10,828
difficult to answer as why am I here?

1031
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:14,780
Free energy, governance and the FEP.

1032
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,350
Inverts the question, instead of asking

1033
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,716
how must the system behave to survive?

1034
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,364
It asks, how do systems that survive

1035
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:24,624
behave? The answer is rather

1036
00:52:24,662 --> 00:52:26,304
deflationary. They survive. Their

1037
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:30,272
purpose is just sustainability. So some

1038
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:32,080
classic Fristinisms,

1039
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,620
some very nice framings on page

1040
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:38,870
95.

1041
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,900
There's some great juxtapositions.

1042
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,384
So it's always awesome to see this

1043
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:52,490
kind of quality work.

1044
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,132
And who knows what people here will

1045
00:52:57,266 --> 00:52:59,870
see? And I don't see any scripts here,

1046
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,100
thus the textbook. But who knows?

1047
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,248
Maybe we can do some generative modeling

1048
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:12,652
of organizations or we can specify

1049
00:53:12,716 --> 00:53:14,370
it and iterate on it,

1050
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,936
realize it in block, for instance, and

1051
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:22,588
Pymdp and for any lab and JF's symbolic

1052
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:23,600
suite.

1053
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,036
So there'll be a lot of fun things to

1054
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:29,380
explore this cohort.

1055
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,814
Any other questions or ideas that people

1056
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:37,680
want to share?

1057
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,758
Thanks. And congratulations to people

1058
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,902
for joining this continuation. It's a

1059
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:50,640
great continuance. And and

1060
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,278
I know that this part is going to be

1061
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:57,854
very interesting. The next three months

1062
00:53:57,892 --> 00:53:58,300
will be interesting.
