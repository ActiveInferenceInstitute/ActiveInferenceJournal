1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,279
hello everyone it's may 26 2022. it's

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,960
the fourth week

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,040
of the first cohort of the octave

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,480
textbook group

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,280
we're in our first discussion of chapter

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
two

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
today we're going to go over the

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
questions that are posted for

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
chapter two

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
then we'll see where that takes us

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
and what ideas of the book have been

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
explored

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
and that'll be the main focus

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
also just a note on the math learning

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,480
group

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,719
those meetings have been occurring on 19

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,520
utc on wednesdays

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
and so in the math learning group you'll

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
find information about how to

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,839
participate

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,239
you'll find and be able to edit

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,879
resources on learning different topics

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
so this is a really helpful activity if

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
people want to share the resources that

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
help them learn about different ideas

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
and that will help people

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
search for a video about this

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
we have a notation table

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,520
that will help us as we start to look at

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
the notation more

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,439
there's some

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,240
math learning basic questions

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,200
like around math anything related to the

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
textbook content

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,080
can go in the main questions math

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
learning group is part of the real

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,840
textbook group so these are not the

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,000
questions to be answered like the other

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
ones that we're going to go to are but

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
this is just about math and then also

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
there's some math oriented overviews

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
like i wrote this summary of the first

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
two-thirds of chapter two so if people

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,159
want to be like

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
continuing to distill

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
and represent what they're learning and

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
what they're asking that's all good

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,759
okay

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,200
any other

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,079
um

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,040
notes that anybody wants to add before

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,479
we start to go into the questions

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
you can raise your hand or you can type

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,798
it in the chat

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,439
okay

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
so we're in the first week of discussing

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,879
chapter two the low road to active

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
inference

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
so just to kind of warm us up

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
um

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,200
what is the low road

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:49,980
um

63
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,119
[Music]

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,720
yeah the low road is

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,159
uh

66
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,879
the bayesian brain approach right here

67
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,000
um is the like proximate

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
next like big concept i guess

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
previous

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
but it's kind of based on i guess yeah i

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,519
mean you could see right in the picture

72
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,879
like it's based on basic it's like

73
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,519
mathematical i the way i conceptualize

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,120
it is like

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
literally

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
uh

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
you know the low road meaning like

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
um very primitive

79
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,959
very mathematical very

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
like hyper analytical

81
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,040
foundational kind of

82
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,239
you know an analysis way of looking at

83
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,640
it i guess

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
that's not necessarily living or

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,400
anything like that right

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
whereas the high road is kind of more

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
about

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,519
the other side of that

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,159
right

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,439
okay

91
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,200
so we're going to be

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
learning about the high road and low

93
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,480
road those are the two paths that are

94
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,640
offered in chapter two and three

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
of the book so hopefully

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
again like

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,478
it would be awesome to have as many

98
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,358
people as possible speak and feel

99
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,520
welcome to share their views during this

100
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
session

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
so everyone is especially encouraged to

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
put questions or comments in the chat or

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,639
raise their hand to speak

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
or find other times to have synchronous

105
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
communications and especially to make

106
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,199
contributions to the coda but really

107
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
appreciate that everyone has come out to

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
go through these discussion

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,880
questions

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
so we're going to now go to the

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
questions

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
that have been placed into the questions

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
table

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,400
and just the more questions the better

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
they can be super short it can be

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
anything that you're having uncertainty

117
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,360
about

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
if you come across a table or a figure

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
or sentence in the text and you have a

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,560
question

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,039
please write the question down

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,440
it will be extremely extremely helpful

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
it doesn't have to be

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
with extensive

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,479
um

126
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,400
references or citations it can just be

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,759
what did this mean if you're uncertain

128
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,039
about something

129
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
and then if you were certain about it

130
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
you could still write a question like

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
what would you ask somebody to test or

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,120
to understand what they understood about

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
it okay

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
so we're gonna start

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,759
with this first

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
most upvoted question but there's still

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,520
time

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
in this session and also

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
till next week in our next session on

140
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
chapter two to add more questions if you

141
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
wrote them down somewhere else and also

142
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
to upvote questions but we're just going

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
to start with the most interestingly

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
voted questions

145
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,319
what is the relevance

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,080
of the support

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,520
and surprise

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
for the different probability

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,000
distributions in table 2.1

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
so what does anyone see in table 2.1

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,318
and what are support and surprise

152
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,359
people mic yes

153
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,319
so table 2.1 looks to me

154
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
excuse me like

155
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
a guide for selecting distributions um

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,160
if you're

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
building out one of these models

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
with support saying

159
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,199
uh you know what set of

160
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
numbers would fit

161
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
within this distribution selection and

162
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
then if you chose this distribution

163
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
how would you look at the support

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,000
equation for it

165
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,160
yeah

166
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
so if you chose this distribution how

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
would you look at the surprise component

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,240
of it

169
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
and we're going to get to surprise and

170
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,919
busy in surprise

171
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
in the coming questions

172
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
so support

173
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,759
using the

174
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,240
definition pulled here from wikipedia

175
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
the support of the function

176
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
is the subset of the x-axis like the

177
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,639
domain

178
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,520
where there's a y value that's not zero

179
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,000
so it's where the function is non-zero

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
defined

181
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
the gaussian

182
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,319
the

183
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,360
normal

184
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
bell curve distribution

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
has non-zero support

186
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
at all numbers

187
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,039
fancy r

188
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,280
and then other distributions have

189
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
different

190
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
variable different values that they're

191
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,840
having non-zero values at like the gamma

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
distribution

193
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,280
is defined over the interval from zero

194
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
to infinity

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
so if it was like how many of this thing

196
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,160
do you have

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
that might be a reason to use a

198
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,879
distribution

199
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,919
that's only positive numbers

200
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,599
or if you were wanting something that

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
could have positive or negative numbers

202
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
of any size the gaussian is a

203
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,440
distribution

204
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
and then another

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,839
one that's like a relevant support

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
difference would be like the dear schley

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
being defined only within the zero to

208
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
one interval

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,959
which helps connect it to probabilities

210
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,600
so the support is where

211
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
that function that distribution

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,760
family is defined and then

213
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
what is

214
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,959
the surprise

215
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,959
does anyone know the name of the little

216
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,560
squiggle they are using to represent

217
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
surprise

218
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,160
i think it's called fracture i

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,680
aka fancy eye

220
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
um

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,959
the first we're going to come to the

222
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,440
definition of surprise in a coming

223
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,720
question

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,160
but um and without going into every

225
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
variable and trying to

226
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,680
overlearn something

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
the surprise of a given observation like

228
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
a data point let's just think about the

229
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,680
gaussian

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,640
x

231
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,519
is the observed data point

232
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
and mu is like the mean of that

233
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
normal distribution which is also the

234
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,680
mode so it's like the center of that

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
distribution

236
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
and then this

237
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,160
capital pi is a variance estimator i

238
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
believe here

239
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
so how surprised one should be by a new

240
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
data point coming in

241
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
is

242
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
related to the difference between that

243
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,640
new data point and the mean so if the

244
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
new data point were exactly on the

245
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,200
center of the distribution

246
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
this whole term is going to go to zero

247
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
so one should not be surprised at all

248
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
by exact

249
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
data points on the mean of the

250
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
distribution but any data point that has

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,519
not exactly on the mean is going to have

252
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,519
some non-zero value

253
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,040
and so it's going to be a function of

254
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,320
how far the data point is from the mean

255
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,519
and

256
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,040
some scaling by the variance

257
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
so

258
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
if we were expecting 100

259
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
with a variance of 10

260
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
versus 100 with a variance of one

261
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
in one case like getting 101 is like a

262
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
one sigma event it has a z score of one

263
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
just speaking loosely here

264
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
whereas in the um case of it having a

265
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,279
variance that's very small

266
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,560
then that might be more surprising

267
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
any other

268
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
comments that people have on table 2.1

269
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
uh i have a question

270
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
set

271
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
yeah

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,519
yeah

273
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,639
so

274
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,959
while i was reading through the chapter

275
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,160
uh there

276
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
so okay uh

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,440
going back to section 2.2 right

278
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
perception as inference

279
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
so when he says when they say that the

280
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,680
brain is a protective machine or a

281
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
statistical organ that in first affects

282
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
external states of the world

283
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,839
uh

284
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
okay here's my question

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
because i'm primarily from a telecom

286
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
background

287
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
so

288
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
most of our

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,959
things

290
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,000
are to get messages across between two

291
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,200
distance transmitters uh receiver right

292
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
so we build noise models so without any

293
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,880
noise you don't get signal

294
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
so you need to know what a noise model

295
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,240
looks like

296
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
and then

297
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,839
you know so for example if the power

298
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
spectrum of the signal is what you

299
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,079
expect from let's say you're using a

300
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,519
gaussian

301
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,160
distribution of noise right so if it's

302
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,160
the same as you expect from the gaussian

303
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
uh you do nothing so that's just noise

304
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
so you don't classify the data that's

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,839
coming

306
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,480
in if it is more than this then

307
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
uh okay so

308
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,600
there might be something interesting

309
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,880
about this there might be some signal

310
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
here so we define the signal to noise

311
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
ratio

312
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
a lot of this chapter seems to be

313
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,120
dealing with the fact that

314
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,320
uh

315
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,040
we by default know what the signal looks

316
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,240
like

317
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
so there's no attempt to build a noise

318
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,600
model here

319
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,160
that would be like okay so uh maybe the

320
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,800
sensor in this case our eyes for example

321
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
or

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
has some

323
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
parameters for it right it can detect

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,959
between

325
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,920
uh

326
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,719
say a bandwidth

327
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
well okay so it can detect a light

328
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,720
between certain frequency ranges but

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
maybe it performs very well in a certain

330
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,639
frequency range and not others there's

331
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,079
more error

332
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:54,800
in

333
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,959
other frequency ranges right so the

334
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,880
noise model should incorporate such

335
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,079
things

336
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,519
imperfections in the sensor

337
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,320
imperfections in the connections between

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,959
the sensor and processing equipment

339
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
but but there's no attempt to do that in

340
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,279
this entire chapter so i'm just curious

341
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,560
as to

342
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
what exactly is the predictive machine

343
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,680
here

344
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
what what is being predicted here

345
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
great question and in general every

346
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,639
question that people have

347
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,920
they're going to be 100 times more

348
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
impactful

349
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,839
if they can be written down

350
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,839
this is just the second chapter it's

351
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,079
introducing us to the essence of

352
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,880
starting with just bayes equation

353
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,040
it's the first equation here starting

354
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
with the the foundation of

355
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
increasingly advanced noise filtering

356
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
approaches so check out live stream 43

357
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
to see how calm and filter and advanced

358
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,959
multi-level bayesian filtering schemes

359
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,279
are used and learned and fit with free

360
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,040
energy minimization and so on but you're

361
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
right that is not approached in this

362
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
chapter

363
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
because it's starting with the essence

364
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
of bayes equation

365
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
and then going to build towards

366
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
another kernel

367
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,639
which is going to be

368
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,320
the kernel of the variational free

369
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
energy

370
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
and then that in this one layer case is

371
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
going to be able to be elaborated and

372
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
parameterized and fit within nested

373
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
models to accommodate like

374
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,279
learning on hyper parameters learning of

375
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,680
noise models and so on but it is not in

376
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
this chapter

377
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,040
okay yeah so i was just i'm sorry if i

378
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,399
threw us off track no so it's perfect

379
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,120
but

380
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,639
they're good questions and then jakob

381
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,600
asked

382
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,959
what do you think of the surprise the

383
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,120
distributions involving a sum product of

384
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,040
the product probability distributions

385
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,920
except for gamma

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,320
actually i guess the gaussian kind of as

387
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
well

388
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
um

389
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,639
yeah maybe i'm thinking about this wrong

390
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,040
but uh i thought that the surprise

391
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,199
was

392
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,240
like the

393
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,839
i guess the information gain

394
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,199
um or

395
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
equivalent

396
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,279
and so for the for the gaussian and the

397
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,560
gamma distributions it's always for one

398
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,839
single

399
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
one single element

400
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,720
uh of the distribution for one x

401
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
but for the multinomial and dirichlet

402
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
there's something over all of the

403
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,880
possible probabilities which makes it i

404
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,360
guess an entropy function

405
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,880
but

406
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,920
is there

407
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,319
is there a difference

408
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,160
for example one could have a

409
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
multi-dimensional gaussian a

410
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,399
two-dimensional gaussian

411
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,680
and then the surprise for the

412
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
two-dimensional gaussian

413
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,839
would be represented as a sum over

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,839
the different dimensions so they've

415
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
shown the gaussian and the gamma

416
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
in the uni-dimensional case and the

417
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,240
multinomial in the dirichlet in a

418
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
multi-dimensional case

419
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
so in that case is it

420
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,359
um

421
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,079
i thought that x was just one element of

422
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,119
the domain

423
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
so that's not necessary so

424
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,640
x is just

425
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,599
if we think of the gaussian as

426
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,839
this kind of bell shaped curve

427
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,880
on the x and y axis we really want the

428
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
f of x value to get like the gaussian

429
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
value but x is

430
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,719
just the input value

431
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
is that correct leave that as accurate

432
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
because yes x is the domain of the

433
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
function and then the sum is over eyes

434
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,559
so if we had a multinomial gaussian or

435
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,840
multi-dimensional gaussian in eye

436
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,919
dimensions then it would have a sum over

437
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,160
eyes

438
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
yeah so if

439
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
but wouldn't uh

440
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
i guess i still have uncertainty about

441
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
why we don't do that for the single uh

442
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
single-dimensional gaussian as well

443
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,120
because

444
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
if we want to

445
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
if we take just one point

446
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,960
on the gaussian i

447
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
understand why that would have a certain

448
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
surprise but then

449
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
in the same way

450
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
if we take one point in the dirichlet

451
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
distribution

452
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,240
wouldn't that also shouldn't that also

453
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,160
have an equivalent

454
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
equation for surprise

455
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
why why in the dirichlet

456
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,400
dirichlet distribution are we summing

457
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,360
over

458
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
all the i's

459
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
but not for the but not but in the

460
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,720
gaussian we are considering just one

461
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
point on the probability distribution

462
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,960
or maybe is maybe dirichlet is

463
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,280
multi multi-dimensional and

464
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
that's the reason

465
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
i think this the uni-dimensional case

466
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
would be just without this sigma i

467
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,440
it would just be this

468
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
but if anyone has any other

469
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,760
thoughts especially if they want to

470
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
contribute them in like writing to

471
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,679
improve our understanding that'd be

472
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,559
awesome

473
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,000
let's continue to next question

474
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
in section 2.4 they write we now

475
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
introduce the simple but fundamental

476
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
advance offered by active inference this

477
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
starts from the same inferential

478
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,320
perspective discussed above but extends

479
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,080
it to consider action as inference

480
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
in your own words what is the simple but

481
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,679
fundamental advance offered by octave

482
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,160
inference

483
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
so what would anyone

484
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,679
write

485
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
or like to share

486
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,080
what is the advance of active inference

487
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,080
so is it uh just bringing action into

488
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
the equation

489
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,240
so

490
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
uh

491
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
predictive coding and

492
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,600
bayesian brain are specifically about

493
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,799
perception

494
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
visual visual perception

495
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
um i think the key thing with active

496
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
inference is that it's um well it's not

497
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
just that it brings action into the

498
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
equation it's that it treats them as

499
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
essentially the same thing that that

500
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,000
kind of united

501
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
um

502
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,080
under as part of the same process

503
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
which i think is which i think is kind

504
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
of a new development

505
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,039
thanks for the awesome answer

506
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
ali

507
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
uh yeah i think uh alan barthold or

508
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,039
bartholos in the brain's sense of

509
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,159
movement

510
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,679
uh is a

511
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,600
has a particularly

512
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,240
uh relevant um

513
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,799
description of action and perception

514
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,679
and uh he writes that perception is

515
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,919
simulated action

516
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,760
and i think that really speaks to

517
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,039
uh the advance made by uh active

518
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,240
inference i mean uh the integration of

519
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,919
action and perception uh or uh in other

520
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,880
words uh as barthold claims the

521
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
simulation

522
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,760
of

523
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,559
action and perception

524
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,760
is

525
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,840
i guess a really novel development

526
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,039
i think i read something

527
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,520
but i i can't remember where i read it

528
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,159
but i i think it was roughly that on

529
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
these existing bayesian brain theories

530
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
um

531
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,400
an aid an agent perceives in order to

532
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
act whereas under active inference and

533
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
agent acts

534
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,280
action kind of precedes perception

535
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,440
so it active inference essentially flips

536
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,559
this

537
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,200
traditional schema in terms of

538
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,640
which one feeds into the other

539
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
yeah i was just gonna say that uh yeah

540
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,000
adding on to

541
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
bringing action into the equation it

542
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
flips it like uh

543
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,679
there's no

544
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
where to where do your priors come from

545
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
where do the hyper parameters get

546
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
specified like where does the model

547
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,679
start where does where is the agency

548
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,880
kind of in

549
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
all of these other models

550
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,320
it's really uh no accordance for that or

551
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,200
it's hard to it's like very emergent

552
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,679
because here it's like very explicitly

553
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,840
specified

554
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
some affordance for that

555
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
thanks brock uh mike and then anyone

556
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,760
else who raises their hand

557
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
yeah so i'm thinking if you have priors

558
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,880
you have some prior assumptions

559
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,760
then

560
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,799
um

561
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,960
do you necessarily need to take action

562
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
in order to

563
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,960
sort of envision what your perception

564
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
might be so it's almost like getting

565
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
into imagination or something like that

566
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,080
you have a set of priors

567
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,720
that can drive uh

568
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,559
what you imagine your perception to be

569
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,600
before any action is taken

570
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
great question blue

571
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
so i think um

572
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
that this was like elaborated on a lot

573
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,000
in section

574
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,480
2.7 when they talk about um pursuing a

575
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
policy

576
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,960
um because there's consequences

577
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
like when we're planning and making

578
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,320
predictions that has consequence

579
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
consequences for both our

580
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,360
perception and our action

581
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,640
um like when i mean even just planning

582
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,000
even in a conversation when someone says

583
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,960
oh have a nice like have a nice day as

584
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
expected at the end of that but like

585
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
have a nice rabbit would be like what

586
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
like you're you're not expecting that

587
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
that to come at the end of that that

588
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,760
sentence so so when you plan it

589
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,279
interferes with your

590
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,960
perception because you didn't plan for

591
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
them to say have a nice rabbit right but

592
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
it also interferes with with your um

593
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,240
action and so i think like this the um

594
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,919
the like novelty or enhanced aspect of

595
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
active inference

596
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
loops into the fact that

597
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,600
perception and action are continually

598
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,719
impacting one another

599
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,039
yes

600
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,640
thanks blue

601
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,799
um

602
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
these are some of the core

603
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,799
memes and themes and it really is

604
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,559
important to understand how active

605
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
inference is similar and different

606
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,840
than other

607
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,320
work in this area like variational

608
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
bayesian inference is not introduced by

609
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
active inference

610
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
bayesian models of perception is not

611
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,799
introduced by active inference

612
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,720
bayesian models of action is not

613
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
introduced by active inference

614
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,320
so it's about finding what has been done

615
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,919
to understand what is being offered

616
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
and then whether one chooses to take

617
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,120
this like

618
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
history of science development of

619
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
science

620
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,679
view

621
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,320
or we kind of just want to state plainly

622
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,720
what it is without wondering what the

623
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,279
advance relative to other frameworks is

624
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
these are all really critical ideas like

625
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,919
the signal processing framework was

626
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,279
brought up earlier

627
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,520
and predictive processing predictive

628
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
coding

629
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
anticipatory systems

630
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
are often

631
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
purely

632
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
about sense

633
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,679
and

634
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,679
just to give one thought on that it kind

635
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,400
of makes sense for a video encoding

636
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,799
algorithm for example because every

637
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,600
piece of the camera is in focus

638
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,640
but

639
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,919
vision requires action

640
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,240
and so that's where we're going to be

641
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
bringing in all these other important

642
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
concepts

643
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,240
like

644
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,919
attention sensory attenuation

645
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:02,799
and

646
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,600
the active decision making component

647
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,720
of vision to resolve uncertainty

648
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
which is what gives rise to a generative

649
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,120
visual field

650
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,039
that seems like there's color everywhere

651
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,559
and seems like there's high resolution

652
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,080
everywhere

653
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,679
though that is not

654
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
the incoming sensory information

655
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
so

656
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,919
by fully taking this generative modeling

657
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,240
perspective on perception

658
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
which

659
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,960
um in live stream number 43.0 maria did

660
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
an awesome job of connecting this

661
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,480
even before helmholtz and kant

662
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
it's plato's cave

663
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
and it's part of this

664
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,360
long discussion about perception

665
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,320
and

666
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,880
action could be a variable

667
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,760
so

668
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,159
there's perceiving and then if action is

669
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,240
a variable then active inference is

670
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
providing

671
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
not just a unified framework

672
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,799
like a bayesian graph framework

673
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,799
for some variables that are interpreted

674
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,480
as perception and some variables that

675
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,640
can be interpreted as action selection

676
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,679
or policy planning

677
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,760
but

678
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,679
there's a tractable approximation

679
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,360
by shifting from the in bringing this

680
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
answer by shifting from an exact

681
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,760
solution to the mathematical problem

682
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,679
bayesian inference

683
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,000
to an approximate solution

684
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
variational free energy which is going

685
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
to provide a bound

686
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
on some

687
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,799
quantity

688
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,000
that might be intractable to compute

689
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
so it's going to give a heuristic

690
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,399
for the action perception cycle

691
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
but this is a really

692
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
great question

693
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,399
so people can continue to return to it

694
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
because people will probably ask us for

695
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,559
a long time to come

696
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,679
how is this different than blank or what

697
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,279
is active inference

698
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,720
these are some of the things that we

699
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
would want to have in mind ali

700
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,279
yeah again going back to bartow

701
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,000
and

702
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,559
his definition of perception as

703
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,399
simulated action

704
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,440
i think it uh also relates nicely to uh

705
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,399
marla ponti's phenomenology marlopanti

706
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,399
uh has a famous

707
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,520
statement and uh as uh has a famous

708
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
insight as

709
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,320
vision is the brain's way of touching uh

710
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,919
and so

711
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,799
you see

712
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,679
uh for instance we

713
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,720
as we

714
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,399
move around space as we uh construct our

715
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,480
sense of spatiality

716
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,720
uh i mean or

717
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,279
our sense of temporality or everything

718
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,440
else uh

719
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,200
we don't just begin with the

720
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
representation of space or time uh i

721
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,840
mean the image of

722
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,039
movement uh constructs because we move

723
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,520
and not as a consequence of our movement

724
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,080
thanks and

725
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,880
we'll

726
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,399
um

727
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,760
continue with the questions but that's

728
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,559
an awesome area to go into with

729
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,080
phenomenology with 4e cognition extended

730
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,279
embedded in culture et cetera et cetera

731
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
and many many of the live streams and

732
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,320
papers have been on those areas so it's

733
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,520
cool to bridge from formal models

734
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,399
of perception cognition and action

735
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,360
into

736
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,559
qualitative and philosophical areas

737
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,559
okay

738
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,159
and then oh thanks for

739
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,640
adding that

740
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,880
the idea of interrelated action and

741
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,559
perception has been around in cognitive

742
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,399
science for a long time

743
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,440
like

744
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,159
dynamical systems theory and inactivism

745
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
emphasize that but active inference

746
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
brings a coherent formalism to the table

747
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
which is a nice advance

748
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,679
well said

749
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,039
next question

750
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,158
figure 2.2

751
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,240
figure 2.2 illustrates why as a result

752
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,679
of an internal

753
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
generative model x and an external

754
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,679
generative process

755
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,399
x star

756
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,919
in order to measure surprise wouldn't we

757
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,240
need another value of y i.e a separate y

758
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,600
that encodes prior beliefs

759
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,840
if y can be objectively measured from

760
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,679
external signals is there a third y

761
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,640
that's considered the observation

762
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,200
first

763
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,919
i'd like to actually go to this question

764
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,360
about two notions of surprise

765
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,679
so um because

766
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,519
they might come to bear on this action

767
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,480
perception loop once we move from just

768
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,919
bayes equation

769
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,159
and calculating surprise on parametric

770
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,760
distributions

771
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
to thinking about

772
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,279
prior updating and cognitive entities

773
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,039
with the generative model that

774
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,279
constitutes a prior with incoming

775
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,799
information coming in

776
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
we're going to start to see why this

777
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,799
notion of surprise and bayesian surprise

778
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,600
are similar and different so

779
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,240
using the apple frog example

780
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,120
so the unobserved hidden state the

781
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,799
latent state of the world is whether

782
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,039
there is an apple or a frog

783
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,120
in a bag for example or just in this

784
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,880
person's area

785
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,919
and then

786
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,000
what can be observed just speaking

787
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,039
coarsely

788
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,279
is it can jump or not

789
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,880
and we can totally go down the rabbit

790
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,240
hole with what is truly observed and

791
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
things like that but this is just what

792
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,399
are in the context of this model the

793
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,320
unobserved state is the actual identity

794
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,399
of the object and the observation is

795
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,159
going to be the action

796
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,279
or not

797
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,200
we take the opportunity to unpack two

798
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
different notions of surprise both of

799
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,559
which are important

800
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,240
the first we refer to simply as surprise

801
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,559
it's the negative log evidence

802
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,919
where evidence is the marginal

803
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,000
probability of observations

804
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,640
so we saw that first sense of surprise

805
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,120
with the fracture i

806
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,840
in

807
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,240
the previous table we looked at

808
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
the second notion of surprise is

809
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,960
referred to as bayesian surprise

810
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,840
this is a measure of how much we have to

811
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
update our beliefs following an

812
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,360
observation

813
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,200
in other words bayesian surprise

814
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,640
quantifies the difference between a

815
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
prior and a posterior probability

816
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,039
what are the similarities and

817
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,480
differences between the two notions of

818
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,960
surprise

819
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,559
okay we'll

820
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,120
see what has been said and then

821
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,320
hear what other people are thinking

822
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,960
um so

823
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,519
page 20 they wrote

824
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,840
that

825
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,799
bayesian surprise scores the amount of

826
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
belief updating as opposed to surprise

827
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,399
which is simply how unlikely or likely

828
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,439
that observation was

829
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,600
so in that gaussian case the surprise is

830
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,240
like about one data point coming in

831
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
given how the distribution's

832
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,760
parameterized right now

833
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,960
how surprising was that one data point

834
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
and then bayesian surprise is going to

835
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,039
be about how much that distribution

836
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,799
is updated

837
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,279
after processing that data point

838
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,880
similarities they both depend on how

839
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
well the agent's generative model

840
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,720
matches the external world

841
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
and they're both measuring surprise

842
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,440
or bayesian surprise in the same units

843
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,799
which are information theoretic

844
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,760
quantities of information i.e gnats or

845
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,559
bits differences plain surprise

846
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,799
marginalizes over all the models degrees

847
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,880
of freedom under the model's prior

848
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,639
distribution over its adjustable

849
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,159
parameters

850
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,280
that would be

851
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
great for someone to unpack what does it

852
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,280
mean to marginalize over the model's

853
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,879
degrees of freedoms

854
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,239
and then bayesian surprise lets the

855
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,000
model choose the best set of parameters

856
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
it can to fit the observed data

857
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,520
and then

858
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,320
measures how much

859
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,719
of an update that was

860
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,760
um mike and then and then blue and then

861
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,599
only

862
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,079
yeah under the first similarity i'm

863
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
wondering if um it's

864
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,879
this dependency on how well the agent's

865
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,320
generative model matches their

866
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
perception of the external world as

867
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
opposed to matches the external world

868
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,839
agree with that great

869
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,239
addition

870
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:54,639
um

871
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,159
blue and then only

872
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
okay i think my hand was just left over

873
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,560
left up okay ellie

874
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,000
uh well i believe that the plain

875
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,079
surprise is a kind of

876
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,119
raw statistical surprise but bayesian

877
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
surprise is a kind of

878
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,960
surprise in a

879
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,079
as a kind of processed surprise or i'm

880
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,680
not sure if i'm

881
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,839
right in saying that

882
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
plain surprise

883
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,720
can

884
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,680
probably be described as an objective

885
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,240
surprise as opposed to bayesian

886
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,880
surprised as a subjective surprise but

887
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
as i said i'm not

888
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
sure

889
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
about the

890
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,320
plausibility of these descriptions

891
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,920
great comments um

892
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
even

893
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,000
the

894
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,520
surprise alone

895
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,560
still depends on the parameters

896
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,640
of the generative model

897
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,680
so it's still is within a processing or

898
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,839
a filtering frame

899
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,640
albeit a fixed one

900
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,800
so um they talk about like uh let's

901
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,480
let's look at the figure where there's a

902
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
graphical overview of this apple and the

903
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,200
frog

904
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
so

905
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
and this is kind of giving

906
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,079
some graphics and words

907
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,560
to fill in this apple frog example so

908
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,680
initially

909
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,000
the person has this likelihood model in

910
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,440
the back of their head

911
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,839
where they have beliefs about how likely

912
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
apples are to jump

913
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,520
they do it one percent of the time and

914
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
how likely frogs are to jump they do it

915
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,839
81 of the

916
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,160
time that's the likelihood that's about

917
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,520
how observations depend on

918
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,560
hidden states of the world

919
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
their prior beliefs are that there's a

920
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,480
10 percent chance

921
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,119
that the entity is a frog

922
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,599
and these are mutually exclusive options

923
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,920
there's no third option here

924
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,960
that would be like another category um

925
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,599
model structure learning on the model so

926
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,640
we're staying within this model for now

927
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
and they sum to one because they're a

928
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
probability

929
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
then there's an observation which is

930
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,079
jumping

931
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,200
and then

932
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,680
the posterior reflects the updated

933
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,359
beliefs

934
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,440
about what the entity is

935
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,119
and so it's like it's so much

936
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,280
overwhelmingly more likely that frogs

937
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,079
jump

938
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,040
that seeing something jump

939
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,440
updates the prior from here to here

940
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,920
so in this case one can calculate

941
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,040
the surprise of the observation

942
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,599
without doing any updating at all

943
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,599
one could just stay fixed in their prior

944
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,440
belief

945
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,320
and then

946
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,119
could describe how surprised they are in

947
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,240
gnats

948
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,280
by given observation

949
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,079
in this full bayesian cycle there is an

950
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,760
updating of the prior to the posterior

951
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,400
and then that updating

952
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,599
can be described in terms of how much

953
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,880
the prior was updated

954
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,839
and so that's like here the model

955
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,520
is updated

956
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,280
to the observed data this is now the

957
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
best fitting model

958
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,280
and then we're calculating the

959
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
difference between these two

960
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,040
distributions

961
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,160
so

962
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,839
um regular surprise being zero means the

963
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,920
data point was exactly as you expected

964
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
bayesian surprise being zero means the

965
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,040
distribution was not updated

966
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,520
high surprise means that the data point

967
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
was extremely unpredicted it was

968
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,760
extremely unlikely

969
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
whether or not you update your model at

970
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
all

971
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,280
high bayesian surprise means that the

972
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,760
distribution was changed a lot as a

973
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,720
function of seeing that happen

974
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,720
ali

975
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,240
uh well perhaps i didn't understand it

976
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,960
correctly but uh isn't it that isn't the

977
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,200
case that in uh the plane surprise or uh

978
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,000
more generally in the uh the

979
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,079
bayesian formulation of the probability

980
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,240
of events uh

981
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,200
the likelihood and both the likelihood

982
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,520
and the priors

983
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,320
are

984
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,839
uh somehow inherent to the phenomena

985
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,680
inherent to the events independent of

986
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,480
the observers

987
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
a great question i hope i'm not going

988
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
off on a branch here but this is related

989
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
to the difference between frequentist

990
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,280
and bayesian approaches to statistics

991
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,880
so frequentism does have

992
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,040
viewed from the bayesian perspective

993
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
frequentism does have priors

994
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,839
they're uniform priors which are not

995
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,079
uninformative priors they just are

996
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,200
uniform

997
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,440
and so in frequentism

998
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,119
we come across like the maximum

999
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,320
likelihood

1000
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
solution or the maximum likelihood

1001
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,280
parameter

1002
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,160
which is just like well if all

1003
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,800
outcomes were equally a priori likely

1004
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,280
uniform prior

1005
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,319
then

1006
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,079
we would just need to evaluate the

1007
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,440
likelihood

1008
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
and find the model with the maximum

1009
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,760
likelihood solution

1010
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,119
bayesian

1011
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,640
offers another degree of freedom and

1012
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,960
says well sure you could pick a uniform

1013
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,400
prior

1014
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,319
that would give you the maximum

1015
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,400
likelihood solution

1016
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,520
or

1017
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,760
you might want to have a prior

1018
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,079
distribution

1019
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,200
over that space so that if something is

1020
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,680
twice as likely a priori and then you

1021
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,119
observe less than 2x evidence for it

1022
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,560
you still might want like the bayes

1023
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,520
factor or your posterior to reflect

1024
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
that one

1025
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,920
rather than just jumping instantly to a

1026
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,720
different maximum likelihood solution

1027
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,440
so yes priors and likelihood are

1028
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,560
implicit

1029
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,319
but they're using a different ontology

1030
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,240
than bayesian statistics

1031
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,960
but

1032
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,599
we're in the bays or the post-based area

1033
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,839
now

1034
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,280
but there's so many connections to

1035
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,960
classical statistics

1036
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,920
and in spm the textbook

1037
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,599
there is

1038
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,240
parametric classical statistics

1039
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,119
non-parametric classical statistics

1040
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,680
and bayesian statistics

1041
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
so

1042
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,079
they're more similar than not

1043
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,079
it just is about seeing where one of

1044
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,640
them is like a special case of another

1045
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,240
or a generalization of another

1046
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,079
okay

1047
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,760
let's see if we can do one or two more

1048
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,359
questions during this session

1049
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,760
okay so let's return to the previous

1050
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,040
question

1051
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,079
so we're looking at figure 2 2

1052
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,880
which is

1053
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,319
something we're going to see different

1054
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,560
representations of

1055
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,599
this

1056
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,000
entity as generative model

1057
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,760
world or niche as generative process

1058
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,599
and then here

1059
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,359
the hidden states are those that are

1060
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,920
unobserved as data

1061
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,160
y is referring to data points that are

1062
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,200
observed as data

1063
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,599
there's a cognitive hidden state

1064
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,160
which is like a prior in this generative

1065
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,280
model and then there's some hidden state

1066
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,640
x star

1067
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,560
but it could have been any letter or any

1068
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
shape

1069
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,240
about the hidden state in the world

1070
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,560
the observation

1071
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,160
is going to everything that happens in

1072
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,800
between here is cognition

1073
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,359
um like the sandwich model

1074
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,160
like

1075
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,440
sense

1076
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,240
think

1077
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,440
act

1078
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,359
that type of model is just referring to

1079
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,319
that little boomerang data come in

1080
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,160
cognitive processing

1081
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,319
action selection

1082
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,040
so we're in that figure

1083
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,119
the question was

1084
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,119
in order to measure surprise

1085
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,359
wouldn't we need another value of y i.e

1086
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,480
a separate y that includes prior belief

1087
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,359
great

1088
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,400
question

1089
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,599
um

1090
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,520
let's just assume that there is a

1091
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,119
gaussian

1092
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,200
generative model

1093
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,319
so the entity has like two parameters in

1094
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,319
its cognitive model the mean and the

1095
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,640
variance

1096
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
then y comes in

1097
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,880
and given the parameterization of the

1098
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,800
generative model

1099
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,400
all that's needed is

1100
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
the data point to come in

1101
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,520
for the surprise to be calculated

1102
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,400
so

1103
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
another value is needed

1104
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,000
but

1105
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,520
whether we call it

1106
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,920
abc xyz z

1107
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,960
is just a mathematical abstraction

1108
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,920
so yes prior beliefs are

1109
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,119
important

1110
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,880
the prior beliefs that can be

1111
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,599
interpreted as the parameterizations

1112
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,839
of the cognitive model are required

1113
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
if y can be objectively measured from

1114
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,560
external signals

1115
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,800
is there a third y that is considered

1116
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,560
the observation

1117
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,000
so

1118
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,160
one could imagine

1119
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,960
a lot of like real world scenarios

1120
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,720
where a more complex model would be

1121
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,640
required you know two people looking at

1122
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,800
the thermometer or all these different

1123
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
sorts of situations

1124
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,879
but um

1125
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,160
unless somebody can unpack this a little

1126
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,839
more

1127
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,319
or explain what they were asking about

1128
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,079
then i don't think a third why is

1129
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,960
required mike

1130
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,880
yeah that was my question so i can try

1131
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,040
and unpack it um

1132
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,440
and so sticking with the thermometer

1133
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,560
example

1134
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,880
at the heart of that last question is

1135
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,480
if we have a thermometer that's

1136
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,200
registering the temperature

1137
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,800
um

1138
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,359
can we consider that as sort of the the

1139
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,119
true observation that is the actual why

1140
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,839
um as measured by this instrument and

1141
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,240
then therefore we can compare our sort

1142
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,319
of internal why with the actual y

1143
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,319
okay

1144
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,960
so i have a really similar and related

1145
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,240
question

1146
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,200
um

1147
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,640
that's like two questions down

1148
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,720
um but it's in a different section but

1149
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
let me just like place some things on

1150
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,000
here and it goes back to like what we

1151
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,160
were saying about like what

1152
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,359
exactly is the hidden state so is the

1153
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,400
hidden state the temperature and the

1154
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,480
data is

1155
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,119
the reading from the thermometer

1156
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,440
that like that's like the the data y

1157
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,359
right like the out this this y in the

1158
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,079
middle but then like what is how i feel

1159
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,480
hot or cold like i mean i'm perfectly

1160
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
positioned to be at 75 all the time so

1161
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,359
like

1162
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,880
i know if it's like one degree too cold

1163
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,240
or one degree too hot like i've got to

1164
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,920
turn up the heat or turn it down or or

1165
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,200
whatever

1166
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,839
but like my registration my sensory

1167
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,240
input is not at 75 degrees like my

1168
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,800
sensory input is i'm hotter i'm cold and

1169
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,119
so this this is like where i mean we

1170
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,319
were talking about this yesterday in the

1171
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,480
math group like there's this really

1172
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
fuzzy line for me like i would love for

1173
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,800
someone to clarify that so i do get what

1174
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
you mean about like this in like

1175
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,240
shouldn't there be another y like

1176
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,160
there's the y out there in the world 75

1177
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,839
degrees and then there's how i feel

1178
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,400
about that y

1179
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,640
okay thanks um

1180
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,720
so

1181
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,760
variables are not like innately tagged

1182
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,400
with being observables or hidden states

1183
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,480
it's a model specific

1184
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,119
framing of what is going to be modeled

1185
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,160
as

1186
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
generated data

1187
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,839
and what is going to be modeled as a

1188
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,520
bayesian prior

1189
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,240
in multi-level bayesian modeling

1190
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
the priors themselves are generated from

1191
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,400
a higher or deeper

1192
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,000
level of the so

1193
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,839
one can be serving in fact multiple

1194
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,599
roles this is the minimal

1195
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,960
prior

1196
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,839
generated data expectation maximization

1197
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:16,960
type

1198
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,280
single layer bayesian kernel

1199
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,480
so we're going to think about this

1200
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,640
temperature example

1201
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,480
there's a hidden state of the generative

1202
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,760
process

1203
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,680
which is going to be the temperature of

1204
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,960
the world

1205
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,200
latent unmodeled so this isn't even

1206
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,480
claiming that there is such a thing as

1207
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,160
temperature this is just the latent

1208
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,800
unobserved temperature

1209
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,280
that is giving rise to thermometer

1210
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
readings which might have like different

1211
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,079
sorts of noise

1212
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,720
then there's another hidden state which

1213
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,480
is the evaluation of temperature

1214
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,520
and so

1215
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,079
this is just a schematic

1216
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,280
that's

1217
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,599
and also the whether it one is labeled x

1218
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:00,880
or y or

1219
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,040
l or triangle

1220
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,400
is like a norm and a convenience

1221
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
but

1222
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,040
the letter doesn't matter

1223
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,800
itself

1224
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,200
it it will be used mostly consistently

1225
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,880
within the textbook

1226
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,880
but there's only so many letters and

1227
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,640
there's not a lot of coherence on

1228
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,540
notation use

1229
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,590
[Music]

1230
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,160
um

1231
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,240
what else could be explored here

1232
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,240
yeah um mike and then ali

1233
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,200
so as i keep ruminating on this which is

1234
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,960
probably more than i should

1235
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,280
um it seems like there can be

1236
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,400
infinite y's right so um

1237
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,160
to the extent that you are

1238
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,920
taking action

1239
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,960
which will

1240
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,240
change your perception then you are

1241
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,400
as a result triggering potentially new

1242
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,359
whys in the system right

1243
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,359
so you just have this infinite potential

1244
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,119
for what y can be

1245
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,119
this speaks to the composability and the

1246
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,079
flexibility of active inference so like

1247
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,800
y could be one pixel of visual input it

1248
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,160
could be a 4k video why could be smell

1249
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,520
and a 4k video why could be lidar and

1250
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
this and that so why is just the

1251
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,359
generalized input

1252
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,040
of sense

1253
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,400
and then action

1254
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,000
might be related

1255
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,040
to this in a very direct way like y

1256
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,520
could be visual input and action could

1257
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,119
be your eye movement

1258
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,040
so that case is going to be explored a

1259
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,880
lot in the book

1260
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,000
however

1261
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,440
it could also be you're getting

1262
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,640
something in

1263
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,079
and then the actions are just totally

1264
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,640
unrelated maybe they don't

1265
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
affect the hidden state the causal

1266
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,880
process in the world at all

1267
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,160
or maybe

1268
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,079
actions enable different wise to enter

1269
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,240
the picture

1270
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,319
this is just the total essence kernel

1271
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,000
and then

1272
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,200
even trivial cases require

1273
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,920
some more apparatus

1274
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,240
ali

1275
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,920
yeah i have a question uh

1276
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,720
is it

1277
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,760
correct to say that the minimization of

1278
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,720
variational free energy aka

1279
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,480
the surprise

1280
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,559
is exactly equivalent to the

1281
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,040
maximization of expectation

1282
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,839
uh i mean is it uh

1283
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,160
i mean the holy linear relationship

1284
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,440
between these two uh or possibly we have

1285
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,960
some uh

1286
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,839
kind of plateaued areas between

1287
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,599
these two

1288
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,160
extremes

1289
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,760
great question

1290
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,920
so this is something that we'll

1291
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,599
come to

1292
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,680
next week in our discussions on chapter

1293
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,200
two so

1294
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,720
we have not

1295
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,599
even discussed variational free energy

1296
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,880
yet

1297
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,160
today we talked about starting

1298
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,559
with a low road on some of the atomic

1299
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,319
calculations that are going to come into

1300
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,200
play like surprise

1301
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,839
and bayesian surprise in a bayesian

1302
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:14,960
framework

1303
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,000
and beginning to partition

1304
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,760
active entities and their action

1305
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,079
perception loops

1306
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,480
in terms of a bayesian graph

1307
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
that's going to be amenable to flexible

1308
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,760
modeling of perceptive cognitive

1309
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,800
active and out there in the world

1310
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,839
variables variables with those

1311
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,760
interpretations and then

1312
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,599
variational free energy is going to come

1313
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,720
into play

1314
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
as a way to bound

1315
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,240
surprise

1316
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,200
so let's

1317
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,359
have some questions in discourse and

1318
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,720
we'll come to it next week but it's an

1319
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,240
awesome question jessica

1320
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,000
hi yes i have a question um

1321
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,240
i guess related to this figure 2.0

1322
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,040
let's say like um in regards to like how

1323
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,720
we interpret on like what we observe so

1324
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,559
like i understand like you have a prior

1325
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,680
that might you know

1326
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
you're anticipating

1327
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,559
you know

1328
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,079
something like some other people's

1329
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,520
behavior or like how things should be

1330
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,359
that might be different from what you

1331
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,040
actually observe

1332
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
but a lot of times at least in terms of

1333
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,240
like when we're thinking like human

1334
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,800
beings like it's like

1335
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,040
an action in the world like

1336
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,559
how you interpret it and has to do a lot

1337
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,160
with on

1338
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,480
your own like views or like your own

1339
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,800
experiences and maybe that connects to

1340
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,440
the priors and like like the

1341
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,520
interpretation might be very different

1342
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,040
like from people to people the

1343
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,760
interpretation will vary a lot because

1344
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,480
everybody has on like a lot of like

1345
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,880
different experiences so

1346
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
those could be like uh encoded i guess

1347
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,520
in the priors um but it's not connected

1348
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,280
per say to the

1349
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,400
production part or maybe it is so i'm

1350
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,079
trying to

1351
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,680
kind of connect that idea and of

1352
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,839
how like our personal interpretation

1353
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,319
based on our experiences which could be

1354
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,480
priors

1355
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,720
make us see the

1356
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,680
um

1357
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,559
like

1358
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,319
like what's happening in the world

1359
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,520
differently

1360
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,720
than other people and so that why would

1361
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,800
look very different from you

1362
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,599
than for me just because we have lived

1363
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,839
different experiences

1364
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,800
so it's not like a like an actual why

1365
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,640
like it's not like you cannot really say

1366
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,440
like

1367
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,040
this is a fact and because it's an

1368
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,119
interpretation at the end of the day

1369
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,280
great question and points

1370
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,559
yeah understanding how

1371
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,480
the individual

1372
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,440
setup of a given entity is related to

1373
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,839
its past experiences and how that could

1374
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,520
be modeled by priors

1375
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,960
is an important

1376
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,319
area

1377
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,000
and um

1378
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,559
some of those rich dynamics

1379
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,400
are not in this

1380
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,200
minimal nucleus

1381
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,599
but it'll be awesome to start to think

1382
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,319
about what does have to be

1383
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,440
in the box here

1384
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,240
to give rise to those kinds of dynamics

1385
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,599
um so that's going to

1386
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,400
end this discussion

1387
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,839
um

1388
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,480
next week we will also be staying in

1389
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,760
chapter two

1390
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,040
and taking it more towards

1391
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,880
variational free energy and expected

1392
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,559
free energy

1393
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,040
so that should be

1394
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,640
fun

1395
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,400
we're going to in this room

1396
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,799
transfer immediately to the dot tools

1397
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,720
meeting so if you want to join for

1398
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,599
activelab.tools meeting everyone is

1399
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,640
welcome and there's no like

1400
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,040
prerequisites or anything like that

1401
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,880
if you want to hang around

1402
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,799
and join tools

1403
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,280
stay in this exact gather space

1404
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,040
if you want to continue talking with

1405
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,440
other people about the book

1406
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,040
or anything else just

1407
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,400
head up into one of the rooms above and

1408
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,079
if anyone anyone who wants to can just

1409
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,880
continue any discussion that they want

1410
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,920
but in this space we're going to

1411
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,839
continue now with tools

1412
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:28,720
so

1413
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,959
thanks everyone
