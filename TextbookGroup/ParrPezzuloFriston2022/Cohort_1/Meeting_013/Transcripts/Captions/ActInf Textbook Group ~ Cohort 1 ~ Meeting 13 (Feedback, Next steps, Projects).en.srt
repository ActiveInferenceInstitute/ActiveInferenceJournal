1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,439
hello everyone it is

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
meeting

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,319
13

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,240
of the active inference textbook group

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
cohort one

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
it is the final meeting of this

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
section

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
it's july 28 2022

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
and we are going to be uh especially

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
thinking about

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,199
feedback and structuring on this

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
textbook group

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
on how the first

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,960
half of the first cohort

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,399
went

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
and also

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,040
the ways that over

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
quite literally the coming minutes and

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,440
hours and days we will be able to

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
implement structures

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
to improve

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,039
our experience for those of us who are

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,440
continuing on to part two

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,199
covert one

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,719
as well as those who are joining for a

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
new cohort

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
in the onboarding page there are two

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,199
columns

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,879
with check boxes

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,760
and

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
clicking these check boxes

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
will sign you up to continue on in

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
chapter six or ten for cohort one

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,680
as well as

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
or alternatively

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,400
to join in chapters one through five

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
with cohort two so select one or both of

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,119
these boxes if you'd like

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
to be continuing

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
on

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
um

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
that's the onboarding note

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,680
and again other than that which i hope

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
those who are here or watching live

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
update according to how they want

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,720
um

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
other than that

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,759
we're going to be talking about future

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
textbook groups and other things like

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,799
that

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
and then also just on the informational

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
briefly on the future textbook group

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,399
page

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
here's the link to share with people to

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,040
join future textbook cohorts so to join

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
in

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
and then also please fill out this

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
feedback form it's really important that

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
even if people think they have limited

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,360
or

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,758
non-valuable feedback that

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,560
they provide it because

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,319
whether it's on this page directly where

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,239
everyone can edit and so every thought

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
that somebody has like even if right now

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
they can just edit this page

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
or

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
in this more anonymous and asynchronous

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
mode or through direct communication

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
but we're experiencing it

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
and so we have the best insight at this

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
point

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
into how to improve it and the

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
affordances that we're seeing today

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
or the the

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
state updates or however you want to use

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
ontology terms to describe it but what

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
we're seeing today

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,239
we can do

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
so we should have a fun discussion today

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
on some of those topics

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,239
and then also look towards project ideas

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,080
many of which are related to the

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
educational process

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
and

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,680
others which are

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
building on education into research

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
and application and so there will be

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
spaces for those as well

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,879
let's begin though on this future

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,360
textbook groups page

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
and

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
anywhere where people want to jump in

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
writing or speaking

95
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,599
how are we going to

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
summarize and distill

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,920
the experience of the last few months in

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
this textbook group

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
and bring it towards improvements in our

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,959
coming

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,959
cohorts

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
yeah i think having worked examples um

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
as i've talked about and um discussed

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
with brock like

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
in jupiter notebooks or like even um

106
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
like simple like did you understand the

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,000
material like question and answer like

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
quizzes at the end of each chapter or

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
um something like that i think which

110
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
just would be useful like to

111
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,800
gauge your own understanding like if

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
there is like a definition or

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
something that we can directly refer

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,840
back to in the text that'd be useful

115
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,840
okay worked examples

116
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,730
yes um

117
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,479
[Music]

118
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,160
great and

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,600
the questions could also include

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,199
little tests of knowledge not every

121
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
question needs to be

122
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
throwing a baseball into the deep

123
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,280
unknown

124
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
it can be

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,479
literally clarifying

126
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,880
for someone who believes that an answer

127
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,639
is in the

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
known unknown space

129
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,080
i i believe there's an answer for this i

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,199
just want to clarify for my

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,400
understanding

132
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
but also once you've clarified that and

133
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
especially if you did just clarify it

134
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,720
then write that example

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
because many of these are opportunities

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
for worked uh examples

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,600
and working examples work in certain

138
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
situations

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
for formalisms for example

140
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
it might also work for formalisms that

141
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
aren't mathematical

142
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,440
like

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
here's the system this way or this

144
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
phenomena how do these ontology terms

145
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,680
map

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
or if this is the blank then what is the

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,039
other thing

148
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,960
okay

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
so we have

150
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
okay anyone else just go for it or let's

151
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
just continue to edit and organize and

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
add notes and just have more because

153
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,720
many

154
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
people are having any

155
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,240
thoughts on directions to go

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
and just like what is the space of some

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
improvements that we can explore

158
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,800
and then how will we

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
be implementing some of these changes

160
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,000
and then in cohort two and someone's

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
like it could be this way and they've

162
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,800
thought of something that's new and not

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
on this list we added if it's on this

164
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
list we say awesome

165
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,039
we agree join us and do it

166
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,039
anyone else with raised hands or we can

167
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
look more at a few other sections before

168
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,520
going to the projects

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,799
like why she different regimes of uh

170
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
attention

171
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,880
i think one way that we can structure

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,160
that is

173
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,920
by clarifying what practices

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,040
were

175
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,959
explicating and where those practices

176
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,839
can take place

177
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
so then because

178
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
the reality is and

179
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
people who are here or listening and

180
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,760
replay can give their input

181
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
many people

182
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
may not

183
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,839
have known what exactly to do

184
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,279
to engage with the material

185
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,399
there's a textbook

186
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
there's some regular meetings there's an

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
information resource

188
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
and it's like an infinite game

189
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
to

190
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,599
structure

191
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
beneficial engagement

192
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
and where the rubber hits the road is

193
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
like being clear about what practices

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
people can engage in

195
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,920
so if we have math

196
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
like not

197
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
everything has to be

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,920
fractaled out into sub-sub-sub-groups

199
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
just including many of the practices

200
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
like if you want to do art about active

201
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,480
inference

202
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
here's a practice and then if people are

203
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
engaging in that practice it does like

204
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
create kind of like a group or a guild

205
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
engaging

206
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,760
in that performance

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,040
so

208
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
however people think like what are

209
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,959
useful

210
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,920
minutes and seconds

211
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
that actually help learning active

212
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
inference

213
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
and we'll be able to have a perspective

214
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
on that question in

215
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,839
years from now that's very different

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,279
based upon better understandings of

217
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,720
competencies and the fundamentals and

218
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
the approachment to the area

219
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
however i think the practices table and

220
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,290
providing feedback and then

221
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,040
[Music]

222
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
sharing and communicating how we're

223
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,040
using practices

224
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
to increase understanding

225
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
could be very important

226
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
for those who are learning and learning

227
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,279
how to learn

228
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,120
jessica and then anyone else

229
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,680
uh yes um i think to build up on sort of

230
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,200
like blue suggestion i'm thinking that

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,399
on

232
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,240
like in someone like all the courses

233
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
that i've taken um you have like all the

234
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
participants giving

235
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
sort of like feedback uh as part of the

236
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,760
learning process you give feedback on

237
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
like the other participants work

238
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
and so it could be that it's like

239
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
there's an exercise and everybody has to

240
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
like fill it up and etc

241
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,720
and then um the other participants or

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
like it could be like two or three and

243
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,519
so not everybody has to do everything um

244
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,480
so it's like yeah two three people you

245
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
read like it's like jessica's like uh

246
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
answer and give a feedback and you know

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
so on

248
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
um because in that way by um having to

249
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
critique or like analyze other people's

250
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
work it helps you think through

251
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
on the material itself

252
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160
and

253
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,519
and yeah

254
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
so that's like another way um of also

255
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
like learning again

256
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,040
there's also amazing like yeah you can

257
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,279
make you could be probably like making a

258
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
mistake also not applying it correctly

259
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,839
but it's like a tool to help you think

260
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
through the material by

261
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,760
analyzing somebody else's work and while

262
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
also you know initially also having to

263
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
do on yourself and then hearing also the

264
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
feedback that other people are going to

265
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
be giving you

266
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
so i was kind of like an idea that came

267
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,560
to mind like

268
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
making reference from like other

269
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
experiences

270
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,839
thank you jessica

271
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,320
yes um

272
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,200
i

273
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
think that's a great area to

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,839
keep in mind

275
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,560
and to balance

276
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,079
as our

277
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,680
cohorts

278
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,279
build and so on

279
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,360
like who's on the supply and who's on

280
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
the demand side of that

281
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
so to speak like who is actually

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
offering the feedback

283
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
and then who's the people who are

284
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,399
wanting feedback

285
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,839
like some of these projects are

286
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
things where the person

287
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,040
was able to be

288
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,079
[Music]

289
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,600
brought in to another project

290
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,959
like

291
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,760
the

292
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,199
like noah's and mike's work

293
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,120
bringing them into synchronous and

294
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,959
asynchronous resources that are already

295
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,439
happening

296
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
provided them with at least a first step

297
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,920
for continuing on their journey

298
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,000
others

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
are um

300
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,519
they're in different areas and so how to

301
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,519
keep it open when people have ideas

302
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,040
ranging from

303
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,440
educational improvements

304
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
to robotic

305
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,800
deployments

306
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,240
what kind of feedback they need and then

307
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
how to balance like the excitement

308
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,519
around applying active inference

309
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,440
with

310
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,639
what it means to learn

311
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,320
like there are biochemistry classes it's

312
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
not all just biochemistry lab

313
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
but who's to say that's even

314
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
the best way or anything like that it's

315
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,800
just we want to make sure that

316
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,399
we keep it all in mind jessica

317
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,199
um yeah and i think this um

318
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
suggests an idea it's not connected to

319
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,600
on someone's project or in a 16 project

320
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
it's more like

321
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,639
an exercise so there's like you know

322
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,720
short exercise that it's going to be

323
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
testing you know variational influence

324
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
or something like that and

325
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
and then um

326
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
yeah like every participant in the class

327
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
go yeah actually does the exercise

328
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,600
and then it's assigned to

329
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
other people in

330
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,399
the cohort and to

331
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
analyze that person's submission and so

332
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
it's like yeah three people in the

333
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,519
course like analyze like jessica's you

334
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,079
know submission and give feedback and

335
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,680
like yeah it's gonna be like for

336
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,040
everybody everyone and we'll be getting

337
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
um three um

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
three feedback on like how they apply

339
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
the terms or like

340
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
you know there are other ways that they

341
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
could be done etcetera and

342
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,519
i mean if some of the things are like

343
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,759
math related like

344
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,000
i will have to see and

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,680
because then the answer is gonna be more

346
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,000
clear it's not gonna be as subjective

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,199
um

348
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,560
but it's more like you know there's a

349
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,800
short exercise

350
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
everybody does the exercise and then

351
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,079
some people then get to review that

352
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,720
um you know that answer of the person

353
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
and give feedback on that so it's like

354
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,720
separate from an actual project

355
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
okay makes sense it's kind of like a

356
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,120
combination of having a good example

357
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
questions

358
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,399
with an organizational structure and

359
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,360
then like you said balancing like where

360
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
there might be

361
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,239
a clearer

362
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
uh

363
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
measuring stick

364
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
like was this

365
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
the right equation

366
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
or the right calculation or not

367
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
versus um

368
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
how did

369
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
this usage of affordances in a new

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
context

371
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,639
make sense to you

372
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,040
and um

373
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,079
yeah also it's not just about getting

374
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
feedback on the person's idea it's like

375
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
the practice of providing

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
constructive ideally written

377
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,000
comments

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
is super important like the secret side

379
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,280
of the questions is

380
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
the discourse

381
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:24,890
um

382
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,199
[Music]

383
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,200
where the kinds of things that questions

384
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,799
and ideas that

385
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
send people on thought excursions and

386
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
research rabbit holes

387
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,880
we can

388
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
collaborate on that response together

389
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
and it doesn't have to be the end-all

390
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,360
be-all

391
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
but sometimes by putting like a seed

392
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
into the workspace by putting like a

393
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,919
prompt or a question

394
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
ten people could write for five minutes

395
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
and then there would be 50 minutes of

396
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
writing on that topic from different

397
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,039
perspectives

398
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
whereas if there's 10 people also there

399
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
could be five minutes of discussion

400
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
which might add more seeds onto the

401
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,039
table and it might

402
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,000
continue to invoke

403
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
whimsy

404
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
or it might continue to instruct if

405
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
there was a broad uncertainty that that

406
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
five minutes of discourse resolved

407
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
i think like

408
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,320
for the questions and it's like somebody

409
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
has like a question that they're trying

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
to understand and everybody's giving

411
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,559
it's the crowd source um answer and

412
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,000
helping you know

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
sense make on the meaning

414
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,360
of on how things are

415
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,840
with the other exercise i think similar

416
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
to i think what blue wants to do like

417
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,080
with the short um

418
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,400
like exercises to test whether people

419
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
know the concept or not

420
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
it's just like adding like by having

421
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,760
people critique other people's work and

422
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
having to like critically think through

423
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
the answer

424
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,720
is another level of learning

425
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
because you it's not just like oh i

426
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
think this is the answer to this it's

427
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,400
like no i actually have to understand

428
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,440
and

429
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,480
one day concept that i'm using to

430
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,919
evaluate

431
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,200
an answer

432
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
and then also evaluate the person's

433
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,799
answer

434
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,760
and

435
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
kind of compare and contrast

436
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,559
and that like having to make

437
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,600
that exercise of critical thinking

438
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
i think helps people um

439
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,799
learn like in a more in-depth way

440
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,400
because you have to think through your

441
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,120
own

442
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,360
thinking process and like what things

443
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,440
mean what somebody else was saying etc

444
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,640
and

445
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,200
and yeah and i i've seen it apply to

446
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,880
like writing i mean i guess it's maybe

447
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
like easy after like writing courses and

448
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
things like that um

449
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
but yeah it's like another way of um

450
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,200
yeah like processing through the

451
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
information

452
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,880
and and then also um

453
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,799
it also maybe like reduces the burden on

454
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,440
maybe like a person having to like go

455
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
through everybody's answer and making

456
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
sure like yeah like i am the teacher

457
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,120
correcting everybody's answers like it's

458
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,039
yeah you're sharing the responsibility

459
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,280
around everybody in the group

460
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,440
of

461
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,840
you know like kind of answering you know

462
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,159
like you know evaluating people's like

463
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,840
responses to an exercise

464
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
thank you brock and then anyone else

465
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,879
with the race hand

466
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,200
uh just to agree with jessica and the

467
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
last part would i was going to add that

468
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
but um

469
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
yeah that just

470
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
systematically created creating a

471
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,080
systematic affordance for people to

472
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,559
review or

473
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,720
provide some

474
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
validation that it's

475
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
correct or on the right path or

476
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
whatever um

477
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,760
will reduce the burden there and

478
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,280
uh

479
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,360
teaching

480
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,600
is probably the best way

481
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,440
to learn

482
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,679
um

483
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
it's

484
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,679
uh

485
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
learning how to learn is

486
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,960
it's like difficult to do without um

487
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,360
teaching

488
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
like learning

489
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,880
self-learning is about teaching yourself

490
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
to get better at teaching you get better

491
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,400
at teaching yourself

492
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,200
thanks um

493
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,320
which

494
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
continue

495
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,520
just the

496
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
circle back that does kind of require

497
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,400
some metastructure to like

498
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
create examples or source them or

499
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,799
whatever

500
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,970
and then provide them

501
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,760
[Music]

502
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,520
um

503
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,840
so i'm not

504
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,480
sure

505
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
outside of the

506
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
project that i put on there and

507
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
maybe it's kind of related to jakobs as

508
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,640
well but

509
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
outside of those two things i'm not sure

510
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,440
we have a clear

511
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,520
affordance to do that yet so

512
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,720
for coming up with examples of

513
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
yeah like examples to work or whatever

514
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,880
yeah like sort either sourcing them and

515
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
then putting them in a structure that

516
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
says oh this is for

517
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
section the chapter one or whatever 1.1

518
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,799
or whatever

519
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,720
this is uh so not questions that are

520
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,159
related to specific parts of the

521
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,480
textbook with people to work through but

522
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
what kind of table or structure

523
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,000
it could be i guess virtually the same

524
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,320
but instead of a question a question

525
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,760
somebody is asking it's an example

526
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,159
for other people to answer maybe with an

527
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,200
answer

528
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,120
that they can see like if they want to

529
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
reveal it or whatever but

530
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
these does that make sense

531
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,840
yes

532
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,640
yes

533
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,960
um that's that's what it could be

534
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
an example to work through in this

535
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
course it doesn't mean this exact tape

536
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
but just make sure that we have written

537
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
it down

538
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
and everyone can be

539
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,320
contributing to like write it down and

540
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
what the structure is because it's not

541
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
like this is a

542
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,240
um impossible affordance

543
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
we can spin up the table right now and

544
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
template it and just start to design it

545
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,400
and over the coming weeks we have time

546
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
to digest all these different inputs

547
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,039
to to make it so you know in a few weeks

548
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,880
it will fly by but we might be able to

549
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,000
be implementing these things

550
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
i wanted to ask what practices did

551
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,120
people

552
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
feel like they engaged in

553
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
fruitfully

554
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
whether it's on here or not just when

555
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
you feel like you were participating in

556
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
the active textbook group what did you

557
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,080
feel like you were doing and how did it

558
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,279
help

559
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,200
equation translation that was like the

560
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,799
most helpful thing that i did

561
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,039
um and i don't think it's there in the

562
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,880
well i guess it's kind of there

563
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
it was like to copy the equations down

564
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,400
but like putting them into natural

565
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,720
language was probably like

566
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
the thing that i did that was maybe most

567
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
useful for

568
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
myself and others

569
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,799
yep

570
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,200
it was a great practice

571
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,080
and

572
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,430
um

573
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,640
[Music]

574
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,600
it

575
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
it

576
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,240
leads to and scaffolds so many other why

577
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,679
is it this way what does this mean what

578
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,600
are the examples it's not like the

579
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
prerequisite per se

580
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,039
it's possible to ask questions without

581
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,159
having the natural language description

582
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,000
but whether it's a basic or a multi-line

583
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,559
equation

584
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
it helps

585
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
bring consilience to that discussion

586
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
because there's a non-zero probability

587
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
that then

588
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
a term is going to be used loosely or

589
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
it's going to be used one way then it's

590
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
going to be conversationally used

591
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,840
slightly differently

592
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
or people will

593
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
not

594
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
agree on which ontology terms

595
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,240
are invoked or not

596
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,120
which can then have every equation start

597
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
to spiral off into every possible

598
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
ontology term

599
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
and they very well might actually

600
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,240
connect

601
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,679
that way

602
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,400
but being able to see

603
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,440
what is variational free energy

604
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
and if there's some term that is being

605
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,720
connected to variational free energy

606
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
that's not being described in the

607
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
equation

608
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,840
that's fine

609
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
like least squared error

610
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
isn't in

611
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
the linear regression y equals mx plus b

612
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
so there can be formal and informal

613
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,279
concepts that are super important for

614
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,120
understanding

615
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
that aren't

616
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
with a symbol

617
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,480
but this was a great

618
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
way to be clear what the symbols

619
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,039
actually are

620
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,880
what other practices did people feel

621
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,440
like they

622
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,640
benefited from

623
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
what would they recommend for a daily

624
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,679
schedule for somebody who wanted to

625
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,000
learn a lot

626
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,360
i think

627
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,559
plus one

628
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,240
there on uh

629
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,360
blues

630
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,799
um like

631
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,399
writing the equations which is like

632
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,039
maybe a super

633
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,120
simple but open-ended almost kind of

634
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,360
version of

635
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
jessica's suggestion um

636
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,720
but also in general uh

637
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,679
just adding stuff to the

638
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,640
coda

639
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
um

640
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,880
asking questions

641
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,679
like

642
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,840
if you read and you don't ask a question

643
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,919
did you

644
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,240
really grapple with it at all i don't

645
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,640
know um

646
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
how do we improve

647
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,320
thinking by writing in the actual number

648
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,480
of typed words

649
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,159
that people add in

650
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,039
as a proxy

651
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,760
during a discussion is one thing but

652
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,159
even just afterwards or on their own

653
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,240
time frame

654
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,679
how can we

655
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,279
have

656
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,000
10 people who do read a chapter just

657
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
scaling numbers

658
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,159
each of them

659
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,760
could think of several questions

660
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,440
ranging from simple

661
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,279
i wasn't sure about

662
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,360
to simple again like more like an

663
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,679
example one like what are the three

664
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,200
kinds of this

665
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,799
and it's totally known and the answer is

666
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,159
fully listed

667
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,399
to researchy questions but

668
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,240
how could we have many more inputs

669
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,919
in terms of

670
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,679
the questions that people

671
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,279
are asking

672
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
do people feel like they

673
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,360
wrote questions in their own

674
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
notes

675
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,039
but didn't bring it into shared

676
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,200
workspace or do people feel like for

677
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,799
themselves or or others that they

678
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,480
observed that the questions weren't

679
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
actually

680
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,840
phrased

681
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,799
um jessica then anyone else

682
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
yes i mean i was gonna share more about

683
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,279
the

684
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,159
student practices and but i guess like

685
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,360
first of all answer like the last

686
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,720
question you

687
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
i mentioned

688
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,799
there were things that i didn't put in

689
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,039
the general um

690
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,440
textbook thing which were more about

691
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,240
parsing information and which was like

692
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,360
helping me

693
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,240
connect the dots and and

694
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,039
synthesize an information

695
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,360
which ali actually helped me a lot also

696
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,399
um

697
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,440
with some of that and but those things

698
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,279
were sort of like

699
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,679
personal for me to like try to make

700
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,520
sense of the material

701
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,279
and in terms of the student practices

702
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,520
i

703
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,360
like

704
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,279
initially i was thinking to do like

705
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,559
every day

706
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,039
and you know like an hour

707
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,960
each for like the reading and maybe like

708
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,039
an hour for the math and to kind of get

709
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,320
foundational things um

710
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,399
but then i found it was like better for

711
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,760
me to

712
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
maybe dedicate like a longer period of

713
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
time on one day or two days for the

714
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,679
reading so i'm supposed to like a little

715
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,000
bit of the reading more like chunk more

716
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,039
and you know two three hours in one day

717
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,520
and then maybe like follow up another

718
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
day with like a longer period of reading

719
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,760
as well instead of daily reading a

720
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,360
little bit

721
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
and

722
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,679
and i think that's more because i guess

723
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,200
for memory i mean they do say to do like

724
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,360
repetition for memory but i think like

725
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
for me it was like well really longer

726
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
and you know have like

727
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,919
the material fresh in your mind as like

728
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,360
really as opposed to going every day and

729
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,880
and then like for the math because i

730
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,519
guess there's less of

731
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,880
them

732
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,799
you know keeping the material price in

733
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,360
your mind like yeah like daily i was

734
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,080
trying to do that so then it fell off a

735
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,480
little bit on on that part

736
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
but yeah like kind of at least one every

737
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
day like but four days a week at least

738
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
like an hour so like trying to focus on

739
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,240
the math

740
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,640
but yeah that's kind of how

741
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
my practice

742
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,039
you know

743
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,080
yeah

744
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,600
develop over time through the course

745
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
so the textbook

746
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
is for

747
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,559
as the

748
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,240
like the research people who want to

749
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
apply in their research if we remember

750
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
like from the introduction

751
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,919
provide readers with the ability to

752
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,600
understand and use active inference in

753
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,879
their own research

754
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,039
we'll have a better sense after part two

755
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,880
with a more

756
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
applied

757
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,740
side

758
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,900
[Music]

759
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
who might the next cohort of the

760
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,279
textbook group

761
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,799
be in and communicate to

762
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,440
yes

763
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
over many iterations and you know can go

764
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
many ways but when people are thinking

765
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
like in the next few weeks

766
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,840
who

767
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,000
blue ro okay

768
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,399
can we review which questions and

769
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,959
understand

770
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,000
because i i don't quite

771
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,240
understand how

772
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,200
like so if we go to the um like if you

773
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,480
want to check out the questions check

774
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
out like chapter two like and a lot of

775
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,880
the questions were so if you scroll down

776
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
um keep scrolling keep scrolling like um

777
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,600
i'm trying to think about

778
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,879
which ones that were skipped let's see

779
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,399
and also there's no skipping there's

780
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,719
what we can address in the one hour or

781
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,239
two hours

782
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,760
right but i mean like we can raise our

783
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,879
attention to all the important questions

784
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,359
yeah it was just like um and then i

785
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
realized like most of my questions were

786
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,599
like of a largely technical nature

787
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,560
so let me scroll through the coda um

788
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,079
and see if i can find them but it was

789
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,440
like

790
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,399
in

791
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
chapter two it was

792
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,199
like let's see

793
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,159
um like the general thing to me is how

794
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,359
how can we

795
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,679
um among other things

796
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
prevent question

797
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,440
self-censorship and filtering

798
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,399
well

799
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,079
that question isn't just like this one

800
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,879
like genius meets genius perfectly

801
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,639
framed specific answer that will be

802
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,800
understood in one sentence but that

803
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
question is like a broader space of

804
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,079
prompts that don't necessarily

805
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,240
have any prior on whether it has to do

806
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,480
with an application or it could be a a

807
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,040
technical question

808
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,520
well so it would use reference yeah good

809
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
it was early it was like in chapter two

810
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,880
and chapter three and there were like a

811
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,640
lot of questions um i'm trying to like

812
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,079
look at the specific i'll have to look

813
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,000
at my own code instead of watching you

814
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,240
beautiful people but um

815
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,599
it was

816
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,000
and like it it just happened early like

817
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,320
in those meetings um and and it's not

818
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,720
that there wasn't time like that we

819
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,400
didn't address the questions in order it

820
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
was like let's skip this because it's

821
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,720
technical let's skip this because it's

822
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,320
technical let's skip this because it's

823
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,079
technical so i just stopped putting my

824
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,520
questions in because i feel like they're

825
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,640
technical

826
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
like what does this little squiggly

827
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,640
symbol mean and and that's why like for

828
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,720
me the translation of equations into um

829
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,400
natural language was the most useful

830
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,480
thing because i feel like all of my my

831
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,240
questions are technical like related to

832
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
the math

833
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,960
so i stopped entering them into the coda

834
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,240
because they were just

835
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,359
skipped over

836
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,200
okay thanks well

837
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,720
you appreciate it

838
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,520
um

839
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,839
again i

840
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:08,880
personally

841
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,480
hope that we can have structures that

842
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
uncouple

843
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
the perceived importance of real-time

844
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,079
speech from the contributions that

845
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,400
people make

846
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
so that we can be really clear about

847
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,160
like which questions we're going to be

848
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,640
addressing in conversation

849
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,440
but

850
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
and and use conversation for what it can

851
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,520
bring

852
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,599
many things

853
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,520
and then

854
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
have

855
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,799
200 questions in chapter two

856
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,520
with many upvoters or with whatever

857
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,359
mechanism that brings different

858
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,400
questions to the four

859
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,160
so there isn't even like the

860
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,720
plausibility of being skipped it's just

861
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
a question of like what will we raise up

862
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,160
and focus on individually and as a group

863
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,839
from the many many questions of

864
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,640
different kinds

865
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,200
that

866
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,320
support

867
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
a beginner

868
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,760
with fundamentals

869
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,560
and a pre-beginner with background and

870
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,880
somebody who's asking research

871
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,440
questions as well

872
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
so i think one simple thing

873
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,680
is uh

874
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,320
if if you go back to the questions um

875
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
table like

876
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,880
you have a um interest column here

877
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,250
um

878
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,040
[Music]

879
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,520
interesting yes even better

880
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,759
um

881
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,040
maybe there is a

882
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,440
um

883
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
what we will address in the netcoming

884
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,480
live stream or a session kind of table

885
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,320
that is taken from the questions table

886
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,119
but the questions table has no such

887
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,280
like

888
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,599
projection of what is interesting or not

889
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,119
in some especially in some

890
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,920
one-dimensional kind of like

891
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,119
yes or no

892
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,079
thing um

893
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,560
it's just a separation of

894
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,680
random

895
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,400
things prompts questions

896
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
and then

897
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,560
there is some process to get it to

898
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
what will what will be addressed in the

899
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,680
live stream

900
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,119
that

901
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:35,820
um

902
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,919
[Music]

903
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
again there's ways to like try to do

904
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,440
things like randomization or trying to

905
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,320
like ensure that you know

906
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,040
we don't continuously ask

907
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,280
focus from one person

908
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
or things like that

909
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,359
the popularity doesn't kind of win the

910
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,640
day

911
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,119
um

912
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,000
there's more complex ways to do this

913
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,079
that are

914
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:06,960
kind of

915
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,200
almost like decision making processes

916
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,680
like um

917
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,640
ephemeral group processes and things

918
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,839
like that but um

919
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,160
yeah i think just separating them

920
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,319
it would be helpful there at least

921
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,079
um another thing might be like zoom you

922
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,599
could do breakout rooms

923
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,680
maybe that's not the format

924
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,800
but um

925
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,440
again just

926
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
uh that's kind of an ephemeral group

927
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,000
process thing like

928
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
perhaps everyone doesn't want to focus

929
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,160
on the same questions

930
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,119
should there be temporary

931
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,680
temporary split averaging of attention

932
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,440
and that for some short period of time

933
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,839
and then

934
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,400
recombine

935
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
don't know what that means for a live

936
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,079
stream or recording precisely but yeah

937
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,240
that's

938
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,118
possible solution

939
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,760
yeah thanks

940
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,319
gather is awesome for these things but

941
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,720
it does require clarity around how it's

942
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
going to be done

943
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,960
like mass one-on-one breakouts mass

944
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,599
smaller great breakouts and rearranging

945
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,319
people using their spatial location to

946
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,760
express

947
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,520
different things and

948
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,759
assemble into different ephemeral teams

949
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,040
okay let's look at some

950
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,839
project

951
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,119
ideas okay

952
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,960
so if for those who are here or not i

953
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,240
hope i'm not misrepresenting anything

954
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,599
um mike

955
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,520
brought up some token economies that's

956
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,640
something that we've been actively

957
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,720
going towards in active block prints

958
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,000
um

959
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,000
so i'll just add just a note column

960
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,680
in active lock for ins

961
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,560
as well as as mentioned earlier um

962
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,040
working with

963
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,319
noaa

964
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,880
on some more some related topics

965
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
okay

966
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,200
audiobook recording of a textbook

967
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,160
just as we go through these projects

968
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,760
um i've recorded

969
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,839
the first

970
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,000
chapter and the preface type materials

971
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,880
do people think that an audio recording

972
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,200
has

973
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,200
utility

974
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,880
and if so is anyone interested to pursue

975
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,119
this avenue with blue and i

976
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,160
because it's very defined

977
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,640
and it involves

978
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,119
primarily the equations having natural

979
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,960
descriptions and then just reading

980
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,200
and it can go many other directions too

981
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,319
but this is like um

982
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,079
kind of a clear accessibility affordance

983
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,240
for different participants that might be

984
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
interesting as well as just get out

985
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,240
there on like youtube and other channels

986
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,200
as having that

987
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,119
artifact blue

988
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,160
i do think it's useful obviously if i've

989
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,760
elected to

990
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,119
i didn't realize i signed up to be the

991
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,720
participant lead but i'm so happy to do

992
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,799
it

993
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,440
co-lead colleague um but but i do think

994
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,839
it's useful as someone who drives like a

995
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,560
considerable amount of time like every

996
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,440
day

997
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,400
um

998
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,560
if it's not like i'm not a very good

999
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
auditory learner but it does help to

1000
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,280
like reinforce the concepts um and i i

1001
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,800
just wanted to mention

1002
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,760
um

1003
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,599
even if like you're not comfortable

1004
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,000
perhaps like doing the math or

1005
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,400
reading the textbook um

1006
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,079
daniel thinks he can read it until it's

1007
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,680
perfect um i would prefer to

1008
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,640
do some video or audio editing

1009
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,119
um so that's also an option is to do

1010
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,280
audio editing like where he's

1011
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,640
like you know you occasionally like

1012
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,480
stutter daniel does it very infrequently

1013
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,960
but but there's the occasional

1014
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,599
tripping over a word or like um saying a

1015
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,599
word twice like when you lose your place

1016
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,319
or something like that so video or audio

1017
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,319
editing um i do it with windows video

1018
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,160
editor but like audio editing is also

1019
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,640
another possible affordance there and it

1020
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,000
would involve like you know reading

1021
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,079
along with textbook to make sure that

1022
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,520
it's accurate that no sentences are

1023
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,680
skipped and then to just splice out any

1024
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,440
like mishaps or just ask him to

1025
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,560
re-record

1026
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,400
the you know markup blanket for

1027
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,319
precision just so you can place it over

1028
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,599
the trip trip up if needed

1029
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,280
yeah thanks definitely we would do a

1030
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,119
multi-part

1031
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,960
i i just did one pass on the first

1032
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,079
chapter no equations etc draft but okay

1033
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,640
anyways just so people who are

1034
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,800
um

1035
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,119
interested here or re-watching can know

1036
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,720
about this okay

1037
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,400
resources for conducting research or

1038
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,240
developing active inference agents ways

1039
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,839
to facilitate the starting of that work

1040
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,720
for participants just a seed idea

1041
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,680
um

1042
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,440
a lot of this is going to be explored in

1043
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,839
part two

1044
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,119
because it's a recipe

1045
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,800
for designing the models and we'll have

1046
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,319
a lot of infrastructure around that as

1047
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,560
well

1048
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,680
so i hope whoever wrote this

1049
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
continues in that interest

1050
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,920
and

1051
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
builds that starting point for

1052
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,520
conducting research or developing agents

1053
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,920
based around what they learn and see in

1054
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,440
part two

1055
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,359
okay

1056
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,680
um

1057
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,319
okay

1058
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,440
also

1059
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
typing just directly in the code is a

1060
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,640
little better than commas because

1061
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,000
sometimes it's hard to understand what

1062
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,240
the comments are

1063
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,359
like referring to

1064
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,119
like okay complete mathematical overview

1065
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,599
of active inference

1066
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,680
derivations of key results maps of

1067
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,599
equations

1068
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,119
yes

1069
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,960
all awesome thank you jacob for

1070
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,800
suggesting this

1071
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,240
um

1072
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,680
i think the closest related works

1073
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,839
are in the actin

1074
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,200
phontology and in knowledge engineering

1075
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,240
and other areas too

1076
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,160
um

1077
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,960
and i hope that we're on this

1078
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,359
path

1079
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,280
however jock up or anyone else wants to

1080
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,800
connect on that

1081
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,839
okay

1082
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,920
actin foundations

1083
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,920
um so here we added this page

1084
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,359
if um

1085
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,119
brock or anyone else wants to add any

1086
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,640
comments

1087
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,520
or

1088
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,280
describe how some of these comments can

1089
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,119
be integrated with

1090
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,599
textbook group

1091
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,240
um

1092
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,880
short answer is i'm not entirely

1093
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,119
sure the precise way to integrate it

1094
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,960
with the textbook group

1095
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,839
but um

1096
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,079
they're

1097
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,839
just um

1098
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,720
perhaps this is related to questions

1099
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,240
making questions

1100
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,359
um

1101
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,839
removing the stigma or whatever like

1102
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,200
it's just helpful i think to have some

1103
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,040
affordance or regime of attention or

1104
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,160
whatever

1105
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,480
thing that says

1106
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,520
hey

1107
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,200
if you don't understand this thing about

1108
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,800
active inference

1109
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,480
that's a foundational thing like

1110
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,240
okay i get entropy but

1111
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,119
and i get energy like the basic concepts

1112
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,960
of them but like when you're subtracting

1113
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,760
them what the hell are we talking about

1114
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,640
you know

1115
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,880
um and then maybe there's you know some

1116
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
follow-on questions

1117
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,760
about

1118
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,559
mathematically what entropy is

1119
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,640
mathematically what is energy or you

1120
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,319
know what does shannon introduce

1121
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,640
specifically what is the difference

1122
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,240
these sorts of things um

1123
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,240
a it's that

1124
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,079
an affordance for that but b it's also

1125
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,680
just acknowledging like um

1126
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,200
there's a wealth of knowledge already

1127
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,640
here

1128
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,839
it's not

1129
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,880
a complete mystery what those back

1130
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,280
background foundational things are

1131
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,559
it's or what learners might want to get

1132
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,079
out of

1133
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,280
um

1134
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,160
some relatively short course to like

1135
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,680
get up to speed

1136
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,040
and feel real confident reading

1137
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,520
the textbook

1138
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,440
and so there's a kind of top-down

1139
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,119
uh

1140
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,240
affordance there too i think

1141
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,200
that needs to be made for um

1142
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,160
people that can say hey there's a

1143
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,079
bunch of equations over or examples over

1144
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,079
here that are these are the most helpful

1145
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,920
ones i've found for

1146
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,200
understanding

1147
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,640
what bayesian inference really is um how

1148
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,079
that really works um

1149
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,680
so

1150
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,640
i guess it would be those two things but

1151
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,319
if you look into the project um

1152
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,079
notes there on that project idea um

1153
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,520
thing it's

1154
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,119
there's a little more

1155
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,440
uh

1156
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,470
detail of um

1157
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,839
[Music]

1158
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,680
yeah just a couple bullet points there

1159
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,359
of just

1160
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,319
it's it's really hard for people i think

1161
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,720
to get into a new thing if there's not a

1162
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,760
model

1163
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,839
if you do chemistry without bore's model

1164
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,680
like good luck

1165
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,359
if you have to jump especially to

1166
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,800
something like

1167
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
electron probability clouds or something

1168
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,960
it's just like why would you do that

1169
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
when you have a perfectly good periodic

1170
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,240
table

1171
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,960
and simple discrete you know and

1172
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,000
it's enough even to do basic physics

1173
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,880
right

1174
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,079
like newtonian stuff right and so

1175
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,520
um

1176
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,839
you need a model like i think a lot of

1177
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,960
people

1178
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,079
history

1179
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,640
is helpful there very minimal amount but

1180
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,400
just a this is where this came from this

1181
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,040
is why it's relevant um

1182
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,240
it's really hard for people i think

1183
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,880
to blindly calculate without that sort

1184
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,599
of

1185
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,559
simple context

1186
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,240
so

1187
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,040
just

1188
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,400
kind of made a very rudimentary

1189
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,319
still kind of scaffolding it um

1190
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,440
coda

1191
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,680
but all it's already linked in that

1192
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,800
project row but i'll put it in that

1193
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,760
sub page there too um

1194
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,720
super

1195
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,400
work in progress

1196
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,880
but um

1197
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,319
yeah i mean the idea is just there's

1198
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,480
these questions are going to be asked

1199
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,559
over and over and over again there will

1200
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,160
be people coming from a more

1201
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,079
mathematical more physics a more

1202
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,319
neuroscience a more from different

1203
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,599
backgrounds

1204
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,240
and so why

1205
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,839
pretend like that's not happening or

1206
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,520
reinvent the wheel every time somebody

1207
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,359
asks a question like just having a

1208
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,079
central resource where people can get a

1209
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,440
lot of value but also maybe

1210
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,680
ask a question that's a little more

1211
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,119
they might not want to ask and seem like

1212
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,319
it's too simple or it's too whatever um

1213
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,240
in

1214
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,520
the live stream

1215
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,839
so

1216
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,359
okay thank you

1217
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,800
any other comments or thoughts on this

1218
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,400
otherwise we'll just continue on for the

1219
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
final minutes

1220
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,839
okay

1221
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,000
textbook enrichment

1222
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,920
yes i hope everyone continues to

1223
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,720
annotate figure out also things on their

1224
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,480
own and explore

1225
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,720
and like

1226
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,960
we're building something really powerful

1227
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,040
with annotation

1228
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,200
so i hope that people can um continue to

1229
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,240
be enriching

1230
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,000
with the structures that we're building

1231
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,359
but yes

1232
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,880
so much of what this group has been

1233
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,520
about has been about textbook enrichment

1234
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,160
and improvement

1235
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,720
robot modeling unless anyone has other

1236
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,440
comments i think learning from jf

1237
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,800
and

1238
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,079
staying in part two will help

1239
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,280
and um yeah jessica and then anyone else

1240
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,440
sorry i think i didn't raise my mind

1241
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,720
yes well

1242
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,319
any general comments that people want to

1243
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,599
provide on the textbook group

1244
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,599
i think the live streams are super

1245
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,359
important

1246
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,400
for the lab and the whole space

1247
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,200
for a maybe obvious reason

1248
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,000
the textbook group is equally

1249
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,079
important

1250
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,680
and these are like the two most

1251
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,440
important things that

1252
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,760
can add value to this space and the lab

1253
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,480
participants so

1254
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,760
that's it

1255
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,640
indeed

1256
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,960
glad that those who have made it

1257
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,400
this far

1258
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,800
see that

1259
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,200
and

1260
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,280
over the right time scales

1261
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,760
in the right way

1262
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,400
we see more and more

1263
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,640
vistas to increase the accessibility and

1264
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,680
rigor of active inference

1265
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,520
so i hope we can hold that frame

1266
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,780
and focus our attention

1267
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,920
[Music]

1268
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,440
to

1269
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,960
provide these functionalities

1270
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,680
because if it's stateable it's doable

1271
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,240
in a way

1272
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,800
and

1273
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,720
if no one from the first cohort wants to

1274
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,280
be an active facilitator or steward

1275
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,079
for

1276
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,319
textbook group 2

1277
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,359
some of these changes will be integrated

1278
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,839
the more people who

1279
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,200
want to

1280
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,119
step in

1281
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,680
to steward

1282
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,800
in our participatory context

1283
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,760
are going to be leverage points for so

1284
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,200
many more people who come through

1285
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,440
so there's like multiple levels of

1286
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,920
affordances for those who see them

1287
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,440
especially at the end of this section

1288
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,760
and

1289
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,160
it's been quite a few months

1290
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,760
any

1291
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,079
last comments

1292
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,079
okay i'm gonna stop the recording in

1293
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,599
three seconds unless somebody wants to

1294
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,760
say something

1295
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,760
okay
