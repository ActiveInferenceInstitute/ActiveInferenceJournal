970	57950	1	A	0.58	00:00	102	Hello everyone. It is meeting 13 of the active inference textbook group cohort one. It is the final meeting of this section. It's July 28, 2022 and we are going to be especially thinking about feedback and structuring on this textbook group, on how the first half of the first cohort went and also the ways that over quite literally the coming minutes and hours and days we will be able to implement structures to improve our experience. For those of us who are continuing on to part two cohort One, as well as those who are joining for a new cohort.
59250	88300	2	A	1.0	00:59	59	In the onboarding page there are two columns with checkboxes and clicking these checkboxes will sign you up to continue on in chapter six through ten for cohort one as well as or alternatively to join in chapters one through five with cohort two. So select one or both of these boxes if you'd like to be continuing on.
90590	148522	3	A	0.92192	01:30	145	That's the onboarding note. And again, other than that, which I hope those who are here or watching live update according to how they want, other than that we're going to be talking about future Textbook groups and other things like that. And then also just on the informational briefly on the Future Textbook Group page, here's the link to share with people to join future Textbook cohorts. So to join in and then also please fill out this feedback form. It's really important that even if people think they have limited or non valuable feedback, that they provide it because whether it's on this page directly where everyone can edit and so every thought that somebody has like even if right now they can just edit this page or in this more anonymous and asynchronous mode or through direct communication but we're experiencing it.
148656	215970	4	A	1.0	02:28	143	And so we have the best insight at this point into how to improve it and the affordances that we're seeing today or the state updates or however you want to use ontology terms to describe it. But what we're seeing today we can do. So we should have a fun discussion today on some of those topics and then also look towards project ideas, many of which are related to the educational process and others which are building on education into research and application and so there will be spaces for those as well. Let's begin though on this Future Textbook Groups page and anywhere where people want to jump in writing or speaking, how are we going to summarize and distill the experience of the last few months in this textbook group and bring it towards improvement in our coming cohorts?
272170	302750	5	B	0.99	04:32	77	Yeah, I think having worked examples as I've talked about and discussed with Brock in Jupyter notebooks or even simple like did you understand the materials? Like question and answer, like quizzes at the end of each chapter or something like that, I think, which just would be useful, like to gauge your own understanding. Like if there is like a definition or something that we can directly refer back to in the text, that'd be useful.
312430	328910	6	A	0.99584	05:12	26	Examples. Yes. Great. And the questions could also include little tests of knowledge. Not every question needs to be throwing a baseball into the deep unknown.
329250	377840	7	A	0.98578	05:29	107	It can be literally clarifying for someone who believes that an answer is in the known unknown space I believe there's an answer for this, I just want to clarify for my understanding. But also once you've clarified that, and especially if you did just clarify it, then write that example because many of these are opportunities for worked examples and worked examples work in certain situations. For formalisms, for example, it might also work for formalisms that aren't mathematical like here's the system this way or this phenomena, how do these ontology terms map? Or if this is the blank, then what is the other thing?
385970	428520	8	A	0.91	06:25	104	Okay, so we have anyone else just go for it. Or let's just continue to edit and organize and add notes and just have more because many people are having many thoughts on directions to go and just like what is the space of some improvements that we can explore? And then how will we be implementing some of these changes? And then in cohort two, when someone's like it could be this way and they've thought of something that's new and not on this list, we add it. If it's on this list, we say awesome, we agree, join us and do it's.
489800	496600	9	A	0.99818	08:09	20	Anyone else with raised hands? Or we can look more at a few other sections before going to the projects.
518120	534190	10	A	0.87931	08:38	31	Like when I see different regimes of attention, I think one way that we can structure that is by clarifying what practices we're explicating and where those practices can take place.
539040	555680	11	A	0.96807	08:59	34	So then, because the reality is and people who are here or listening in replay can give their input, many people may not have known what exactly to do to engage with the material.
558710	580040	12	A	0.99328	09:18	39	There's a textbook, there's some regular meetings, there's an information resource and it's like an infinite game to structure beneficial engagement. And where the rubber hits the road is like being clear about what practices people can engage in.
583210	610210	13	A	0.99983	09:43	58	So if we have math, everything has to be fractaled out into sub sub subgroups, just including many of the practices. Like if you want to do art about active inference, here's a practice and then if people are engaging in that practice it does create kind of like a group or a guild engaging in that performance.
613970	641000	14	A	0.99885	10:13	50	So however, people think like what are useful minutes and seconds that actually help learning active inference and we'll be able to have a perspective on that question in years from now. That's very different based upon better understandings of competencies and the fundamentals and the approachment to the area.
644600	662090	15	A	0.99999	10:44	35	However, I think the practices table and providing feedback and then sharing and communicating how we're using practices to increase understanding could be very important for those who are learning and learning how to learn.
677710	679740	16	A	0.99232	11:17	5	Jessica and then anyone else?
682110	716710	17	C	0.5915	11:22	74	Hi yes. I think to build up on sort of like blue suggestion, I'm thinking that in some of the courses that I've taken, you have the other participants giving feedback as part of the learning process. You give feedback on the other participants work. So it could be that there's an exercise and everybody has to fill it up, et cetera. And then the other participants, it could be like two or three.
716860	719000	18	C	0.99767	11:56	7	So not everybody has to read everything.
721230	738480	19	C	0.57	12:01	36	Two, three people. You read like Jessica's answer and give a feedback and so on. Because in that way, by having to critique or analyze other people's work, it helps you think through the material itself.
741490	773610	20	C	0.78411	12:21	82	So that's another way of also learning. Again, there's also missing. You could be probably making a mistake, also not applying it correctly, but it's like a tool to help you think through the material by analyzing somebody else's work while also initially also having to do on yourself and then hearing also the feedback that other people are going to be giving you. So that was kind of like an idea that came to mind, like making reference from other experiences.
777790	780540	21	A	0.99996	12:57	4	Thank you. Jessica yes.
788410	844470	22	A	0.99	13:08	99	I think that's a great area to keep in mind and to balance as our cohorts build and so on, who's on the supply and who's on the demand side of that, so to speak. Like, who is actually offering the feedback and then who is the people who are wanting feedback. Like, some of these projects are things where the person was able to be brought into another project like Noah's and Mike's work, bringing them into synchronous and asynchronous resources that are already happening, provided them with at least a first step for continuing on their journey.
846810	873120	23	A	0.9976	14:06	47	Others are they're in different areas. And so how to keep it open when people have ideas ranging from educational improvements to robotic deployments, what kind of feedback they need, and then how to balance the excitement around applying active inference with what it means to learn.
875810	903814	24	A	0.8773	14:35	60	Like, there are biochemistry classes. It's not all just biochemistry lab, but who's to say that's even the best way or anything like that? It's just we want to make sure that we keep it all in mind. Jessica yeah, and I think this suggestion is not connected to someone's project or Net 16 project. It's more like an exercise.
903862	954330	25	C	0.99939	15:03	89	So there's like a short exercise that it's going to be testing variational inference or something like that. And then every participant in the class actually does the exercise. And then it's assigned to other people in the cohort to analyze that person's submission. So it's like three people in the course analyze Jessica's submission and give feedback. And it's going to be like for everybody will be getting three feedback on how they applied the terms, or there are other ways that they could be done, et cetera.
955950	1010746	26	C	0.76713	15:55	114	If some of the things are like math related I will have to see because then the answer is going to be more clear. It's not going to be as objective but it's more like there's a short exercise, everybody does the exercise and then some people then get to review that answer of the person and give feedback on that. So it's like separate from an actual project. Okay, makes sense. It's kind of like a combination of having good example questions with an organizational structure and then like you said, balancing like where there might be a clearer measuring stick like was this the right equation or the right calculation or not?
1010928	1064360	27	A	0.92854	16:50	87	Versus how did this usage of affordances in a new context make sense to you? And also it's not just about getting feedback on the person's idea. It's like the practice of providing constructive, ideally written comments is super important. Like the secret side of the questions is the discourse where the kinds of things that questions and ideas that send people on thought excursions and research rabbit holes, we can collaborate on that response together and it doesn't have to be the end all, be all.
1066890	1081450	28	A	0.90263	17:46	40	But sometimes by putting like a seed into the workspace, by putting like a prompt or a question, ten people could write for 5 minutes and then there would be 50 minutes of writing on that topic from different perspectives.
1083790	1104690	29	A	0.83222	18:03	47	Whereas if there's ten people also there could be 5 minutes of discussion which might add more seeds onto the table and it might continue to invoke whimsy or it might continue to instruct if there was a broad uncertainty that that 5 minutes of discourse resolved.
1107350	1191230	30	C	0.89	18:27	176	Yeah, I was going to say I think for the questions it's like somebody has a question that they're trying to understand and everybody's giving the crowdsource answer and helping sense make the meaning of how things are with the other exercise. I think similar to I think what Blue wants to do with the short exercises to test whether people know the concept or not. It's just like adding by having people critique other people's work and having to critically think through the answer is another level of learning because it's not just like oh, I think this is the answer to this. It's like, no, I really have to understand one, the concept that I'm using to evaluate an answer and then also evaluate that person's answer and kind of compare and contrast and having to make that exercise of critical thinking. I think helps people learn in a more in depth way because you have to think through your own thinking process and what things mean, what somebody else was saying, et cetera.
1193250	1236330	31	C	0.73	19:53	78	And I've seen it apply to writing. I mean, I guess it's maybe easier to writing courses and things like that, but yeah, it's like another way of processing through the information. And then also it also maybe reduces the burden on maybe, like, a person having to go through everybody's answer and making sure I'm the teacher, correcting everybody's answers. You're sharing the responsibility around everybody in the group of answering, evaluating people's responses to an exercise.
1238510	1241360	32	A	0.99997	20:38	11	Thank you, Brock. And then anyone else with the right hand.
1246690	1285050	33	D	0.99911	20:46	56	Just to agree with Jessica. And the last part, I was going to add that, but yeah, just systematically creating a systematic affordance for people to review or provide some validation that it's correct or on the right path or whatever will reduce the burden there. And teaching is probably the best way to learn it's.
1287630	1305060	34	D	0.50218	21:27	31	Learning how to learn is like difficult to do without teaching. Like learning self learning is about teaching yourself to get better at teaching, you get better at teaching yourself. Thanks.
1314250	1326520	35	D	0.98956	21:54	24	Just the circle back. That does kind of require some meta structure to create examples or source them or whatever and then provide them.
1329550	1371494	36	D	0.85714	22:09	100	So I'm not sure outside of the project that I put on there and maybe it's kind of related to Yakubs as well, but outside of those two things, I'm not sure we have a clear affordance to do that yet. For coming up with examples of yeah. Like examples to work or whatever? Yeah, either sourcing them and then putting them in a structure that says, oh, this is for section chapter one or whatever 1.1 or whatever. So not questions that are related to specific parts of the textbook with people to work through, but what kind of.
1371532	1409410	37	D	0.99998	22:51	99	Table or structure could be, I guess virtually the same. But instead of a question somebody is asking, it's an example for other people to answer, maybe with an answer that they can see, like if they want to reveal it or whatever. Does that make sense? Yes, it could be an example to work through in this course. It doesn't be in this exact table, but just make sure that we have written it down and everyone can be contributing to write it down and what the structure is because it's not like this is an impossible affordance.
1410230	1426760	38	A	0.99996	23:30	53	We can spin up the table right now and template it and just start to design it. And over the coming weeks we have time to digest all these different inputs to make it. So in a few weeks it will fly by, but we might be able to be implementing these things.
1431150	1460822	39	A	0.87	23:51	71	I wanted to ask, what practices did people feel like they engaged in fruitfully, whether it's on here or not. Just when you you felt like were participating in the active textbook group, what did you feel like you were doing and how did it help? Equation translation? That was like the most helpful thing that I did and I don't think it's there. Well, I guess it's kind of there.
1460956	1471980	40	B	0.99997	24:20	31	It was like to copy the equations down, but putting them into natural language was probably like the thing that I did that was maybe most useful for myself and others.
1477070	1495378	41	A	0.36194	24:37	36	Yep, it was a great practice. And it it leads to and scaffolds so many other why is it this way? What does this mean? What are the examples? It's not like the prerequisite per se.
1495544	1555750	42	A	0.98758	24:55	129	It's possible to ask questions without having the natural language description. But whether it's a basic or a multiline equation, it helps bring consilience to that discussion. Because there's a non zero probability that then a term is going to be used loosely or it's going to be used one way. Then it's going to be conversationally used slightly differently, or people will not agree on which ontology terms are invoked or not, which can then have every equation start to spiral off into every possible ontology term, and they very well might actually connect that way. But being able to see what is variational free energy, and if there's some term that is being connected to variational free energy that's not being described in the equation, that's fine.
1555900	1579760	43	A	0.99638	25:55	47	Like least squared error isn't in the linear regression y equals MX plus b. So there can be formal and informal concepts that are super important for understanding that aren't with a symbol. But this was a great way to be clear what the symbols actually are.
1592390	1601210	44	A	0.9466	26:32	10	What other practices did people feel like they benefited from?
1603580	1608810	45	A	0.99993	26:43	16	What would they recommend for a daily schedule for somebody who wanted to learn a lot.
1637740	1677030	46	D	0.98	27:17	61	I think. Plus one there on blues, like writing the equations, which is like maybe a super simple but open ended, almost kind of version of Jessica's suggestion, but also in general, just adding stuff to the coda, asking questions. Like if you read and you don't ask a question, did you really grapple with it at all? I don't know.
1682280	1736710	47	A	0.9901	28:02	114	How do we improve thinking by writing? And the actual number of typed words that people add in as a proxy during a discussion is one thing, but even just afterwards, or on their own time frame, how can we have ten people who do read a chapter just scaling numbers? Each of them could think of several questions ranging from simple I wasn't sure about to simple again, like more like an example one like what are the three kinds of this? And it's totally known and their answer is fully listed to research your questions. But how could we have many more inputs in terms of the questions that people are asking?
1737260	1752540	48	A	1.0	28:57	36	Do people feel like they wrote questions in their own notes but didn't bring it into shared workspace? Or do people feel like for themselves or others that they observed that the questions weren't actually phrased?
1755560	1757430	49	A	0.86864	29:15	4	Jessica then anyone else?
1760120	1802740	50	C	0.95	29:20	86	I was going to share more about the student practices. But I guess first of all, the last question you mentioned there were things that I didn't put in the general textbook thing, which were more about parsing information, which was like helping me connect the dots and synthesize information, which Ali actually helped me a lot also with some of that. But those things were sort of like personal for me to try to make sense of the material in terms of the student practices.
1807400	1844850	51	C	0.99967	30:07	97	Initially I was thinking to do every day like an hour each for the reading and maybe like an hour for the math to kind of get foundational things. But then I found it was better for me to maybe dedicate, like, a longer period of time on one day or two days for the reading, as opposed to, like, a little bit of the reading or chunk more. Two, 3 hours in one day and then maybe follow up another day with a longer period of reading as well. Instead of daily reading. A little bit.
1847140	1887660	52	C	0.99	30:47	109	And I think that's more because I guess for memory I mean, they do say to do like repetition for memory but I think for me it's like well read longer and have the material fresh in your mind as reading as opposed to going every day. And then for the math, because I guess there's less of keeping the material press in your mind daily. I was trying to do that. So then it fell off a little bit on that part. But yeah, at least it wasn't every day but four days a week, at least like an hour or so trying to focus on the math.
1888260	1898370	53	C	0.99917	31:28	15	But yeah, that's kind of how my practice got developed over time through the course.
1948660	1967130	54	A	0.99805	32:28	37	So the textbook is for as the research people who want to apply in their research, if we remember from the introduction, provide readers with the ability to understand and use active inference in their own research.
1971430	1978850	55	A	0.79031	32:51	13	We'll have a better sense after part two with a more applied slide.
1984330	1991320	56	A	0.99962	33:04	14	Who might the next cohort of the textbook group be in and communicate to?
1994010	2029180	57	A	0.9992	33:14	39	Yes, over many iterations and, you know, can go many ways, but when people are thinking like in the next few weeks who blue wrote, okay, can we review which questions and understand because I don't quite understand how.
2032990	2054802	58	B	0.99076	33:52	58	If you want to check out the questions, check out chapter two. And a lot of the questions were so if you scroll down, keep scrolling, keep scrolling. I'm trying to think about which ones that were skipped. Let's see. And also there's no skipping there's what we can address in the 1 hour or 2 hours, right.
2054936	2075820	59	A	0.52626	34:14	56	So we can raise our attention to all the important questions. Yeah, it was just like and then I realized most of my questions were of a largely technical nature. So let me scroll through the coda and see if I can find them. But it was like in chapter two, it was like let's see.
2078830	2109780	60	A	0.88	34:38	73	The general thing to me is how can we, among other things, prevent question, self censorship and filtering? We know that question isn't just like this one. Genius meets genius. Perfectly framed specific answer that will be understood in one sentence but that question is like a broader space of prompts that don't necessarily have any prior on whether it has to do with an application or it could be a technical question.
2112470	2123160	61	A	0.8	35:12	42	Yeah, good. It was early. It was like in chapter two and chapter three and there were a lot of questions. I'm trying to look at the specific. I'll have to look at my own coda instead of watching you beautiful people.
2126490	2138902	62	B	0.89415	35:26	44	It just happened early in those meetings. And it's not that there wasn't time like that. We didn't address the questions in order. It was like let's skip this because it's technical, let's skip this because it's technical. Let's skip this because it's technical.
2138966	2162278	63	B	0.99999	35:38	69	So I just stopped putting my questions in because I feel like they're technical. What does this little squiggly symbol mean? And that's why for me the translation of equations into natural language was the most useful thing because I feel like all of my questions are technical, like related to the math. So I stopped entering them into the coda because they were just skipped over. Okay, thanks.
2162364	2204820	64	A	0.99937	36:02	78	Well, yeah, I appreciate it. Again, I personally hope that we can have structures that uncouple the perceived importance of real time speech from the contributions that people make so that we can be really clear about which questions we're going to be addressing in conversation and use conversation for what it can bring many things and then have 200 questions in chapter two with many upvoters or with whatever mechanism that brings different questions to the fore.
2206950	2234300	65	A	0.99976	36:46	57	So there isn't even like the plausibility of being skipped. It's just a question of like what will we raise up and focus on individually and as a group from the many, many questions of different kinds that support a beginner with fundamentals and a pre beginner with background and somebody who's asking research questions as well.
2244030	2257920	66	D	0.97888	37:24	22	So I think one simple thing is if you go back to the questions table like you have an interest column here.
2261010	2295900	67	D	0.99991	37:41	55	Interesting. Yes, even better, maybe there is what we will address in the next coming live stream or session kind of table that is taken from the questions table. But the questions table has no such projection of what is interesting or not, especially in some one dimensional kind of like yes or no thing.
2298110	2338120	68	D	0.87747	38:18	67	It's just a separation of random things, prompts questions and then there is some process to get it to what will be addressed in the live stream that again, there's ways to try to do things like randomization or trying to like ensure that, you know, we don't continuously ask focus from one person and or things like that. The popularity doesn't kind of win the day.
2341130	2379934	69	D	0.9786	39:01	64	There's more complex ways to do this that are kind of almost like decision making processes like ephemeral group processes and things like that. But yeah, I think just separating them it would be helpful. There at least another thing might be like zoom, you could do breakout rooms. Maybe that's not the format. But again, just that's kind of an Ephemeral group processing.
2379982	2415934	70	D	0.62675	39:39	66	Like perhaps everyone doesn't want to focus on the same questions. Should there be a temporary split of verging of attention for some short period of time and then recombine? Don't know what that means for a live stream or recording precisely but that's possible solution. Yeah, thanks. Gather is awesome for these things but it does require clarity around how it's going to be done.
2416132	2430770	71	A	0.99963	40:16	26	Like mass one on one breakouts, mass smaller breakouts and rearranging people using their spatial location to express different things and assemble into different Ephemeral teams.
2445310	2467230	72	A	0.98	40:45	39	Okay, let's look at some project ideas. Okay, so for those who are here or not, I hope I'm not misrepresenting anything. Mike brought up some token economies that's something that we've been actively going towards in Active Blockprints.
2473570	2510550	73	A	0.99705	41:13	51	So I'll just add just a note column in Active Block, for instance, as well as as mentioned earlier, working with Noah on some more some related topics. Okay. Audiobook recording of a textbook just as we go through these projects. I've recorded the first chapter and the preface type materials.
2512570	2520090	74	A	1.0	41:52	9	Do people think that an audio recording has utility?
2524570	2571480	75	A	0.99	42:04	102	And if so, is anyone interested to pursue this avenue with blue and eye because it's very defined and it involves primarily the equations, having natural descriptions and then just reading and it can go many other directions too. But this is like kind of a clear accessibility affordance for different participants that might be interesting as well as just get out there on YouTube and other channels as having that artifact blue. I do think it's useful obviously, if I've elected to I didn't realize I signed up to be the participant lead but I'm so happy to do it. Is.
2574730	2622886	76	B	0.99592	42:54	115	But I do think it's useful as someone who drives a considerable amount of time every day. If it's not like I'm not a very good auditory learner, but it does help to reinforce the concepts. And I just wanted to mention even if you're not comfortable perhaps doing the math or reading the textbook, Daniel thinks he can read it until it's perfect. I would prefer to do some video or audio editing so that's also an option is to do audio editing occasionally. Daniel does it very infrequently but I think there's the occasional tripping over a word or saying a word twice like when you lose your place or something like that.
2622988	2650640	77	B	0.98752	43:42	81	So video or audio editing, I do it with Windows video editor. But audio editing is also another possible affordance there and it would involve reading along with the textbook to make sure that it's accurate that no sentences are skipped and then to just splice out any mishaps. Or just ask him to rerecord the Markov blanket for precision just so you can splice it over the trip up if needed. Yeah, thanks. Definitely we would do a multi part.
2651650	2664578	78	A	1.0	44:11	31	I just did one pass on the first chapter? No equations, et cetera. Draft, but okay. Anyways, just so people who are interested here or rewatching can know about this. Okay.
2664744	2704240	79	A	0.9697	44:24	86	Resources for conducting research or developing active inference agents, ways to facilitate the starting of that work for participants. Just a seed idea. A lot of this is going to be explored in part two because it's a recipe for designing the models, and we'll have a lot of infrastructure around that as well. So I hope whoever wrote this continues in that interest and builds that starting point for conducting research or developing agents based around what they learn and see in part two. Okay.
2710010	2732320	80	A	0.68	45:10	42	Okay. Also, typing just directly in the code is a little better than comments, because sometimes it's hard to understand what the comments are like referring to. Okay. Complete mathematical overview of active inference, derivations of key results, maps of equations. Yes.
2733090	2763674	81	A	0.8	45:33	47	All awesome. Thank you, Jakub, for suggesting this. I think the closest related works are in the active phontology and in knowledge engineering and other areas too, and I hope that we're on this path. So however Jacob or anyone else wants to connect on that. Okay.
2763872	2784360	82	A	0.87179	46:03	31	Active foundations. So here we added this page if Brock or anyone else wants to add any comments or describe how some of these comments can be integrated with textbook group.
2791780	2858280	83	D	0.81387	46:31	111	Um, short answers. I'm not entirely sure the precise way to integrate it with the textbook group, but there are just perhaps this is related to questions, making questions, removing the stigma or whatever. Like, it's just helpful, I think, to have some affordance or regime of attention or whatever thing that says, hey, if you don't understand this thing about active inference, that's a foundational thing. Like, okay, I get entropy and I get energy, like the basic concepts of them, but when you're subtracting them, what the hell are we talking about? And then maybe there's some follow on questions about mathematically what entropy is mathematically, what is energy?
2858350	2864090	84	D	0.62	47:38	14	Or what is Shannon entropy specifically? What is the difference? These sorts of things.
2868640	2929970	85	D	0.67	47:48	112	A, it's that an, affordance for that, but B, it's also just acknowledging, like, there's a wealth of knowledge already here. It's not a complete mystery what those background foundational things are or what learners might want to get out of some relatively short course to get up to speed and feel real confident reading the textbook. And so there's a kind of top down affordance there too, I think, that needs to be made for people that can say, hey, there's a bunch of equations over or examples over here that are these are the most helpful ones I found for understanding what Bayesian inference really is, how that really works.
2932100	2984992	86	D	0.7749	48:52	109	So I guess it would be those two things. But if you look into the project notes there on that project idea thing, there's a little more detail of just a couple of bullet points there of just. It's really hard for people, I think, to get into a new thing if there's not a model. If you do chemistry without Bohr's model, good luck. If you have to jump, especially to something like electron probability clouds or something, it's just like why would you do that when you have a perfectly good periodic table and simple discrete and it's enough even to do basic physics like Newtonian stuff.
2985046	2997780	87	D	0.99909	49:45	31	Right. You need a model. I think a lot of people history is helpful. There very minimal amount, but just this is where this came from. This is why it's relevant.
2998920	3030000	88	D	0.77101	49:58	52	It's really hard for people, I think, to blindly calculate without that sort of simple context. So I just kind of made a very rudimentary still kind of scaffolding it, coda it's already linked in that project row, but I'll put it in that sub page there too. Super work in progress.
3034420	3075500	89	D	0.97	50:34	95	The idea is just these questions are going to be asked over and over and over again. There will be people coming from a more mathematical, more physics, more neuroscience from different backgrounds. And so why pretend like that's not happening or reinvent the wheel every time somebody asks a question? Like just having a central resource where people can get a lot of value, but also maybe ask a question that's a little more they might not want to ask and seem like it's too simple or it's too whatever in the live stream.
3078580	3080130	90	A	1.0	51:18	3	Okay, thank you.
3082980	3087410	91	A	0.99995	51:22	16	Any other comments or thoughts on this? Otherwise we'll just continue on for the final minutes.
3089460	3116510	92	A	0.85	51:29	44	Okay. Textbook enrichment. Yes. I hope everyone continues to annotate, figure out also things on their own and explore and like we're building something really powerful with annotation. So I hope that people can continue to be enriching with the structures that we're building.
3118000	3141910	93	A	0.99991	51:58	44	But yes, so much of what this group has been about has been about textbook enrichment and improvement robot modeling. Unless anyone has other comments, I think learning from JF and staying in part two will help. And yeah, Jessica and then anyone else?
3146030	3148860	94	C	0.99124	52:26	11	Sorry, I think I didn't raise my. Hand from no worries.
3152590	3158400	95	A	0.99992	52:32	14	Yes. Well, any general comments that people want to provide on the textbook group?
3171850	3192910	96	D	1.0	52:51	44	I think the live streams are super important for the lab and the whole space for maybe obvious reason. The textbook group is equally important. These are like the two most important things that can add value to the space and the lab participants.
3195730	3231370	97	A	0.44767	53:15	52	Indeed, glad that those who have made it this far see that. And over the right timescales in the right way, we see more and more vistas to increase the accessibility and rigor of active inference. So I hope we can hold that frame and focus our attention to provide these functionalities.
3233550	3284600	98	A	0.99989	53:53	90	Because if it's statable, it's doable in a way. And if no one from the first Cohort wants to be an active facilitator or steward for textbook group two, some of these changes will be integrated. The more people who want to step in to steward in our participatory context are going to be leverage points for so many more people who come through. So there's like multiple levels of affordances for those who see them, especially at the end of this section. And it's been quite a few months.
3288700	3291000	99	A	0.99991	54:48	3	Any last comments?
3296760	3300590	100	A	0.69	54:56	15	Okay, I'm going stop the recording in 3 seconds unless somebody wants to say something.
3307800	3308550	101	A	0.98	55:07	1	Okay.
