00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,590
Hello everyone. It is meeting 13

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,270
of the active inference textbook group

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,094
cohort one. It is the final meeting of

4
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:19,834
this section. It's July 28,

5
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:23,710
2022 and we are going to be

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,350
especially thinking about feedback and

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,774
structuring on this textbook group,

8
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,430
on how the first half of the first

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,062
cohort went and

10
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:41,354
also the ways that over quite

11
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,322
literally the coming minutes and hours

12
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,974
and days we will be able to implement

13
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:49,402
structures to improve our

14
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,246
experience. For those of us who are

15
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:54,640
continuing on to part two cohort One,

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,878
as well as those who are joining for a

17
00:00:56,884 --> 00:01:00,490
new cohort. In the onboarding

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,554
page there are two columns with

19
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:07,650
checkboxes and clicking these checkboxes

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,554
will sign you up to continue on in

21
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,114
chapter six through ten for cohort one

22
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:18,194
as well as or alternatively to join

23
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:21,234
in chapters one through five with cohort

24
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,686
two. So select one or both of these

25
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:28,300
boxes if you'd like to be continuing on.

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,610
That's the onboarding note. And again,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,266
other than that, which I hope those who

28
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:39,862
are here or watching live update

29
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:43,294
according to how they want, other than

30
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:45,582
that we're going to be talking about

31
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,774
future Textbook groups and other things

32
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,966
like that. And then also just on the

33
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,142
informational briefly on the Future

34
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,346
Textbook Group page, here's the link to

35
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:56,930
share with people to join future

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,514
Textbook cohorts. So to join in and then

37
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:02,914
also please fill out this feedback form.

38
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,706
It's really important that even if

39
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:07,746
people think they have limited or non

40
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:11,430
valuable feedback, that they provide it

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,702
because whether it's on this page

42
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:15,974
directly where everyone can edit and so

43
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,382
every thought that somebody has like

44
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:19,174
even if right now they can just edit

45
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,746
this page or in this more anonymous and

46
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,482
asynchronous mode or through direct

47
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:28,522
communication but we're experiencing it.

48
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,814
And so we have the best insight at this

49
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,126
point into how to improve it and

50
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:36,240
the affordances that we're seeing today

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,142
or the state updates or however

52
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:41,566
you want to use ontology terms to

53
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:43,620
describe it. But what we're seeing today

54
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,426
we can do. So we should have a

55
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:50,226
fun discussion today on some of those

56
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:53,298
topics and then also look towards

57
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:55,730
project ideas, many of which are related

58
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,814
to the educational process and others

59
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:03,542
which are building on education into

60
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:06,486
research and application and so there

61
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:09,766
will be spaces for those as well. Let's

62
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,446
begin though on this Future Textbook

63
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:15,174
Groups page and anywhere

64
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:19,734
where people want to jump in writing

65
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:23,326
or speaking, how are we

66
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:26,526
going to summarize and

67
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:29,614
distill the experience of the last few

68
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,934
months in this textbook group and bring

69
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:34,786
it towards improvement in our coming

70
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:35,970
cohorts?

71
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,350
Yeah, I think having worked examples as

72
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,894
I've talked about and discussed with

73
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:41,960
Brock in Jupyter notebooks or even

74
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,698
simple like did you understand the

75
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:47,850
materials? Like question and answer,

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,878
like quizzes at the end of each chapter

77
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:52,826
or something like that, I think, which

78
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:55,146
just would be useful, like to gauge your

79
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,566
own understanding. Like if there is like

80
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,806
a definition or something that we can

81
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:01,486
directly refer back to in the text,

82
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:02,750
that'd be useful.

83
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,540
Examples. Yes.

84
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,754
Great. And the questions could also

85
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,854
include little tests of knowledge.

86
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:26,522
Not every question needs to be throwing

87
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:29,774
a baseball into the deep unknown. It can

88
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:33,294
be literally clarifying for someone who

89
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:37,162
believes that an answer is in the known

90
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,618
unknown space I believe there's an

91
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:40,974
answer for this, I just want to clarify

92
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:43,234
for my understanding. But also once

93
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:45,426
you've clarified that, and especially if

94
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,862
you did just clarify it, then write that

95
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,406
example because many of these are

96
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:55,910
opportunities for worked examples and

97
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,782
worked examples work in certain

98
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:01,160
situations. For formalisms, for example,

99
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,586
it might also work for formalisms that

100
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:07,946
aren't mathematical like here's the

101
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,186
system this way or this phenomena, how

102
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,330
do these ontology terms map?

103
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,806
Or if this is the blank, then what is

104
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,840
the other thing?

105
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,812
Okay, so we have anyone

106
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,124
else just go for it. Or let's just

107
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,092
continue to edit and organize and add

108
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,560
notes and just have more because many

109
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,976
people are having many thoughts on

110
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,456
directions to go and just like what is

111
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:45,648
the space of some improvements that we

112
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:49,104
can explore? And then how will we be

113
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,850
implementing some of these changes?

114
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,208
And then in cohort two, when someone's

115
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:55,856
like it could be this way and they've

116
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:56,996
thought of something that's new and not

117
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,516
on this list, we add it. If it's on this

118
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:01,960
list, we say awesome, we agree,

119
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,520
join us and do it's.

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,824
Anyone else with raised hands? Or we can

121
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:15,192
look more at a few other sections before

122
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,600
going to the projects.

123
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,776
Like when I see different regimes of

124
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:44,216
attention, I think one way that we

125
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:47,432
can structure that is by clarifying what

126
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,964
practices we're

127
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,112
explicating and where those practices

128
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,190
can take place.

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,844
So then, because the reality is and

130
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,888
people who are here or listening in

131
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,850
replay can give their input, many people

132
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,576
may not have known what exactly to

133
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:15,680
do to engage with the material.

134
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,342
There's a textbook, there's some regular

135
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,578
meetings, there's an information

136
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:25,758
resource and it's

137
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:30,050
like an infinite game to structure

138
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,158
beneficial engagement. And where the

139
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:37,142
rubber hits the road is like being clear

140
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:39,394
about what practices people can engage

141
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,040
in.

142
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,530
So if we have math,

143
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,906
everything has to be fractaled out into

144
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:54,806
sub sub subgroups, just including

145
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,878
many of the practices. Like if you want

146
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,870
to do art about active inference,

147
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,414
here's a practice and then if people are

148
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,350
engaging in that practice it does create

149
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,154
kind of like a group or a guild engaging

150
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,210
in that performance.

151
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,294
So however, people think like what are

152
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:20,510
useful minutes and seconds

153
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,606
that actually help learning active

154
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,986
inference and we'll be able to have a

155
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:30,514
perspective on that question in years

156
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:34,722
from now. That's very different based

157
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:36,486
upon better understandings of

158
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,854
competencies and the fundamentals and

159
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:41,000
the approachment to the area.

160
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,012
However, I think the practices table and

161
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:51,620
providing feedback and then sharing

162
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,800
and communicating how we're using

163
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,820
practices to increase understanding

164
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,736
could be very important for those who

165
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,090
are learning and learning how to learn.

166
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,740
Jessica and then anyone else?

167
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,786
Hi yes. I think to build up on sort

168
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,110
of like blue suggestion, I'm thinking

169
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,870
that in some of

170
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,382
the courses that I've taken, you have

171
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:38,670
the other participants giving feedback

172
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,706
as part of the learning process. You

173
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:43,470
give feedback on the other participants

174
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,246
work. So it could be that there's

175
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,686
an exercise and everybody has to fill it

176
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,734
up, et cetera. And then the

177
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,006
other participants, it could be like two

178
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,342
or three. So not everybody has to read

179
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:02,186
everything. Two, three people.

180
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,154
You read like Jessica's answer and give

181
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,274
a feedback and so on. Because in that

182
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,618
way, by having to critique or analyze

183
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:15,742
other people's work, it helps you think

184
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:18,480
through the material itself.

185
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,398
So that's another way of also learning.

186
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,670
Again, there's also missing.

187
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,774
You could be probably making a mistake,

188
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:31,838
also not applying it correctly, but it's

189
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:34,466
like a tool to help you think through

190
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:38,130
the material by analyzing somebody

191
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,314
else's work while also initially also

192
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,014
having to do on yourself and then

193
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:44,694
hearing also the feedback that other

194
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:47,526
people are going to be giving you. So

195
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,126
that was kind of like an idea that came

196
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:52,074
to mind, like making reference from

197
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:53,610
other experiences.

198
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,540
Thank you. Jessica yes.

199
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,814
I think that's a great area to

200
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:15,270
keep in mind and to balance

201
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,546
as our cohorts build and so

202
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:23,658
on, who's on the supply and who's on the

203
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:27,306
demand side of that, so to speak. Like,

204
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,450
who is actually offering the feedback

205
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,350
and then who is the people who are

206
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,374
wanting feedback. Like, some of these

207
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:38,894
projects are things where the

208
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:44,566
person was able to be brought

209
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:48,340
into another project like

210
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,874
Noah's and Mike's work, bringing them

211
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,934
into synchronous and asynchronous

212
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:57,800
resources that are already happening,

213
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,880
provided them with at least a first step

214
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,470
for continuing on their journey.

215
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,278
Others are they're

216
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:11,866
in different areas. And so how to keep

217
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:14,086
it open when people have ideas ranging

218
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:17,850
from educational improvements to

219
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,170
robotic deployments,

220
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,766
what kind of feedback they need, and

221
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:26,202
then how to balance the excitement

222
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:30,240
around applying active inference with

223
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,120
what it means to learn.

224
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,046
Like, there are biochemistry classes.

225
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:40,420
It's not all just biochemistry lab,

226
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,242
but who's to say that's even the best

227
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:46,274
way or anything like that? It's just we

228
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:49,846
want to make sure that we keep it

229
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:53,254
all in mind. Jessica yeah,

230
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,142
and I think this suggestion is not

231
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,982
connected to someone's project or Net 16

232
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:04,026
project. It's more like an exercise. So

233
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:06,326
there's like a short exercise that it's

234
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:09,526
going to be testing variational

235
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:13,354
inference or something like that. And

236
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:17,066
then every participant in

237
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:20,822
the class actually does the exercise.

238
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,402
And then it's assigned to other people

239
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:29,214
in the cohort to analyze

240
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,450
that person's submission. So it's like

241
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,782
three people in the course analyze

242
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,922
Jessica's submission and give feedback.

243
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,520
And it's going to be like for everybody

244
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,374
will be getting three

245
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,330
feedback on how they applied the terms,

246
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,794
or there are other ways that they could

247
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:56,618
be done, et cetera. If some of

248
00:15:56,624 --> 00:16:00,378
the things are like math related I will

249
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:03,386
have to see because then the answer is

250
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:04,398
going to be more clear. It's not going

251
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:08,014
to be as objective but it's more

252
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,950
like there's a short exercise,

253
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,894
everybody does the exercise and then

254
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:17,794
some people then get to review that

255
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:19,646
answer of the person and give feedback

256
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,066
on that. So it's like separate from an

257
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,060
actual project.

258
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,546
Okay, makes sense. It's kind of like a

259
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,126
combination of having good example

260
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:31,874
questions with an organizational

261
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,334
structure and then like you said,

262
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:37,974
balancing like where there might be a

263
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:42,534
clearer measuring

264
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:47,370
stick like was this the right equation

265
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,770
or the right calculation or not? Versus

266
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,998
how did this usage of affordances in a

267
00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:59,360
new context make sense to you?

268
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,634
And also

269
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,826
it's not just about getting feedback on

270
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:09,946
the person's idea. It's like the

271
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,902
practice of providing constructive,

272
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,778
ideally written comments is super

273
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:19,694
important. Like the secret side of the

274
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:27,614
questions is the discourse where

275
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,486
the kinds of things that questions and

276
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,178
ideas that send people on thought

277
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:34,610
excursions and research rabbit holes,

278
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,894
we can collaborate on that response

279
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:42,930
together and it doesn't have to be the

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,360
end all, be all.

281
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,474
But sometimes by putting like a seed

282
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,126
into the workspace, by putting like a

283
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,360
prompt or a question,

284
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,578
ten people could write for 5 minutes and

285
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:58,906
then there would be 50 minutes of

286
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:00,554
writing on that topic from different

287
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:01,450
perspectives.

288
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,786
Whereas if there's ten people also there

289
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:09,102
could be 5 minutes of discussion which

290
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,006
might add more seeds onto the table and

291
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:14,590
it might continue to invoke

292
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,094
whimsy or it might continue to

293
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,594
instruct if there was a broad

294
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,266
uncertainty that that 5 minutes of

295
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,690
discourse resolved.

296
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,100
Yeah,

297
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,270
I was going to say I think for the

298
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,286
questions it's like somebody has a

299
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,326
question that they're trying to

300
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:40,134
understand and everybody's giving the

301
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:44,390
crowdsource answer and helping sense

302
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,234
make the meaning of how

303
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:51,386
things are with the other exercise. I

304
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,146
think similar to I think what Blue wants

305
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:57,254
to do with the short exercises

306
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,366
to test whether people know the concept

307
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:02,714
or not. It's just like adding

308
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,466
by having people critique other people's

309
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,918
work and having to critically think

310
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:11,566
through the answer is another level of

311
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:14,274
learning because it's not just like oh,

312
00:19:14,312 --> 00:19:15,874
I think this is the answer to this.

313
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:17,394
It's like, no, I really have to

314
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:21,278
understand one, the concept

315
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:25,014
that I'm using to evaluate an answer

316
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,586
and then also evaluate that person's

317
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:31,618
answer and kind of compare and contrast

318
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:35,030
and having to make that

319
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,458
exercise of critical thinking. I think

320
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,706
helps people learn in a

321
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,674
more in depth way because you have to

322
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:46,186
think through your own thinking process

323
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:49,082
and what things mean, what somebody else

324
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,230
was saying, et cetera.

325
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,318
And I've seen it apply to writing. I

326
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:58,142
mean, I guess it's maybe easier to

327
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,320
writing courses and things like that,

328
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,300
but yeah, it's like another way of

329
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,940
processing through the information.

330
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,154
And then also it

331
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,254
also maybe reduces the burden on maybe,

332
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,814
like, a person having to go through

333
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,406
everybody's answer and making sure I'm

334
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,826
the teacher, correcting everybody's

335
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:24,326
answers. You're sharing the

336
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,454
responsibility around everybody in the

337
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:30,954
group of

338
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:34,902
answering, evaluating people's responses

339
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,330
to an exercise.

340
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,254
Thank you, Brock. And then anyone else

341
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,360
with the right hand.

342
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,662
Just to agree with Jessica. And the last

343
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:53,218
part, I was going to add that, but yeah,

344
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:56,686
just systematically creating

345
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:58,900
a systematic affordance for people to

346
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,860
review or provide some

347
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,286
validation that it's correct or on the

348
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:11,266
right path or whatever will reduce

349
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:16,230
the burden there. And teaching

350
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:25,050
is probably the best way to learn it's.

351
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,102
Learning how to learn is like difficult

352
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,870
to do without teaching.

353
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,894
Like learning self learning is about

354
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:41,726
teaching yourself to get better at

355
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:42,766
teaching, you get better at teaching

356
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,060
yourself. Thanks.

357
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,126
Just the circle back. That does kind of

358
00:21:57,148 --> 00:22:00,870
require some meta structure to create

359
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,046
examples or source them or whatever and

360
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,520
then provide them.

361
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,274
So I'm not sure outside of

362
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:16,780
the project that I put on there and

363
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,838
maybe it's kind of related to Yakubs as

364
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:21,966
well, but outside of those two things,

365
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:26,170
I'm not sure we have a clear affordance

366
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,254
to do that yet. For coming

367
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,786
up with examples of yeah. Like examples

368
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:36,162
to work or whatever? Yeah, either

369
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:38,146
sourcing them and then putting them in a

370
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,306
structure that says, oh, this is for

371
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:43,986
section chapter one or whatever 1.1 or

372
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,886
whatever. So not questions that are

373
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,350
related to specific parts of the

374
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,342
textbook with people to work through,

375
00:22:50,396 --> 00:22:52,790
but what kind of. Table or structure

376
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,006
could be, I guess virtually the same.

377
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,034
But instead of a question somebody is

378
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,314
asking, it's an example for other

379
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:04,860
people to answer, maybe with an answer

380
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,386
that they can see, like if they want to

381
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:10,074
reveal it or whatever. Does that make

382
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:11,740
sense? Yes,

383
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,126
it could be an example to work through

384
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:17,726
in this course. It doesn't be in this

385
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:19,694
exact table, but just make sure that we

386
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,638
have written it down and everyone can be

387
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,686
contributing to write it down and what

388
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,306
the structure is because it's not like

389
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:29,410
this is an impossible affordance.

390
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,306
We can spin up the table right now and

391
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,906
template it and just start to design it.

392
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,534
And over the coming weeks we have time

393
00:23:36,572 --> 00:23:40,006
to digest all these different inputs to

394
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:43,286
make it. So in a few weeks it

395
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:45,334
will fly by, but we might be able to be

396
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:46,760
implementing these things.

397
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,674
I wanted to ask, what practices did

398
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:57,610
people feel like they engaged in

399
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,730
fruitfully,

400
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,294
whether it's on here or not. Just when

401
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:06,818
you you felt like were participating in

402
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,058
the active textbook group, what did you

403
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,306
feel like you were doing and how did it

404
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:13,058
help? Equation translation? That was

405
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,380
like the most helpful thing that I did

406
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,478
and I don't think it's there. Well, I

407
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,846
guess it's kind of there. It was like to

408
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:23,814
copy the equations down, but putting

409
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,510
them into natural language was probably

410
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,762
like the thing that I did that was maybe

411
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:31,980
most useful for myself and others.

412
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,810
Yep, it was a great practice.

413
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,478
And it

414
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:49,082
it leads to and scaffolds

415
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,198
so many other why is it this way? What

416
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:52,606
does this mean? What are the examples?

417
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:55,378
It's not like the prerequisite per se.

418
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,122
It's possible to ask questions without

419
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:59,170
having the natural language description.

420
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,010
But whether it's a basic or a multiline

421
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,930
equation,

422
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,922
it helps bring consilience

423
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,878
to that discussion. Because there's a

424
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:16,726
non zero probability that then a term is

425
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,206
going to be used loosely or it's going

426
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,498
to be used one way. Then it's going to

427
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:20,806
be conversationally used slightly

428
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:24,490
differently, or people will not agree

429
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,394
on which ontology terms are invoked or

430
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:31,982
not, which can then have

431
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:34,542
every equation start to spiral off into

432
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:36,750
every possible ontology term,

433
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,390
and they very well might actually

434
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,620
connect that way. But being able to see

435
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,826
what is variational free energy, and if

436
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,154
there's some term that is being

437
00:25:49,192 --> 00:25:50,802
connected to variational free energy

438
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:52,866
that's not being described in the

439
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:56,630
equation, that's fine. Like least

440
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,054
squared error isn't in the

441
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,840
linear regression y equals MX plus b.

442
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,266
So there can be formal and informal

443
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:07,434
concepts that are super important for

444
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:11,114
understanding that aren't with

445
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,940
a symbol. But this was a great

446
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,566
way to be clear what the symbols

447
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:19,760
actually are.

448
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,074
What other practices did people feel

449
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:40,532
like they benefited

450
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:44,584
from? What would they

451
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:47,016
recommend for a daily schedule for

452
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,810
somebody who wanted to learn a lot.

453
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,770
I think. Plus one there on

454
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,972
blues, like writing the equations,

455
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:29,676
which is like maybe a super simple but

456
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:32,270
open ended, almost kind of version of

457
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,068
Jessica's suggestion, but also in

458
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:41,170
general, just adding stuff to the

459
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,250
coda, asking questions.

460
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,856
Like if you read and you don't ask a

461
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:54,292
question, did you really

462
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:57,030
grapple with it at all? I don't know.

463
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,312
How do we improve thinking by writing?

464
00:28:05,376 --> 00:28:08,010
And the actual number of typed words

465
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,912
that people add in as a proxy during

466
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:16,552
a discussion is one thing, but even just

467
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:19,400
afterwards, or on their own time frame,

468
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,692
how can we have ten

469
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:26,092
people who do read a chapter just

470
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:30,572
scaling numbers? Each of them could

471
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,316
think of several questions ranging

472
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:37,728
from simple I wasn't sure about to

473
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:39,936
simple again, like more like an example

474
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:42,384
one like what are the three kinds of

475
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,644
this? And it's totally known and their

476
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,076
answer is fully listed to research your

477
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:50,532
questions. But how could we have many

478
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:54,244
more inputs in terms of the

479
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:57,624
questions that people are asking? Do

480
00:28:57,662 --> 00:29:00,296
people feel like they wrote questions in

481
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:04,276
their own notes but didn't

482
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,424
bring it into shared workspace? Or do

483
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:08,296
people feel like for themselves or

484
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:09,708
others that they observed that the

485
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,540
questions weren't actually phrased?

486
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,430
Jessica then anyone else?

487
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,470
I was going to share more about the

488
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,708
student practices. But I guess first of

489
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:29,850
all, the last question you mentioned

490
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,936
there were things that I didn't put in

491
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,636
the general textbook thing, which were

492
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:38,990
more about parsing information,

493
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,124
which was like helping me connect the

494
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:46,510
dots and synthesize information,

495
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,730
which Ali actually helped me a lot also

496
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,872
with some of that. But those things were

497
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:57,696
sort of like personal for me to try to

498
00:29:57,718 --> 00:30:00,884
make sense of the material in terms of

499
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:02,740
the student practices.

500
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,310
Initially I was thinking to do every day

501
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,676
like an hour each for the reading and

502
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:17,096
maybe like an hour for the math to kind

503
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:20,730
of get foundational things.

504
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,608
But then I found it was better for me to

505
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:27,928
maybe dedicate, like, a longer period of

506
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:30,456
time on one day or two days for the

507
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:31,836
reading, as opposed to, like, a little

508
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:35,164
bit of the reading or chunk more. Two,

509
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:38,896
3 hours in one day and then maybe follow

510
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:41,056
up another day with a longer period of

511
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,324
reading as well. Instead of daily

512
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:44,850
reading. A little bit.

513
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,250
And I think that's more because I guess

514
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,612
for memory I mean, they do say to do

515
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:55,396
like repetition for memory but I think

516
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:58,324
for me it's like well read longer and

517
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,876
have the material fresh in your mind as

518
00:31:01,978 --> 00:31:04,090
reading as opposed to going every day.

519
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,224
And then for the math, because I guess

520
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:11,988
there's less of keeping

521
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:15,092
the material press in your mind daily.

522
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:17,876
I was trying to do that. So then it fell

523
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:21,544
off a little bit on that part. But yeah,

524
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,484
at least it wasn't every day but four

525
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:25,708
days a week, at least like an hour or so

526
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:28,944
trying to focus on the math. But yeah,

527
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:36,064
that's kind of how my practice got

528
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:38,370
developed over time through the course.

529
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,452
So the textbook is for as

530
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:37,316
the research

531
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,204
people who want to apply in their

532
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:41,076
research, if we remember from the

533
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:43,768
introduction, provide readers with the

534
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:45,316
ability to understand and use active

535
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,130
inference in their own research.

536
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,580
We'll have a better sense after part two

537
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,850
with a more applied slide.

538
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,598
Who might the next cohort of the

539
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:09,894
textbook group be in

540
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:11,320
and communicate to?

541
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,254
Yes, over many iterations and,

542
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,666
you know, can go many ways, but when

543
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:20,794
people are thinking like in the next few

544
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:27,908
weeks who blue

545
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:28,890
wrote, okay,

546
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,614
can we review which questions and

547
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:46,282
understand because I

548
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:49,180
don't quite understand how.

549
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,330
If you want to check out the questions,

550
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,798
check out chapter two. And a lot of the

551
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,640
questions were so if you scroll down,

552
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,986
keep scrolling, keep scrolling. I'm

553
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:06,398
trying to think about which ones that

554
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:09,422
were skipped. Let's see. And also

555
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:11,106
there's no skipping there's what we can

556
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:13,780
address in the 1 hour or 2 hours,

557
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,466
right. So we can raise our attention to

558
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:19,506
all the important questions. Yeah, it

559
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:22,194
was just like and then I realized most

560
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:23,922
of my questions were of a largely

561
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:26,786
technical nature. So let me scroll

562
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:29,526
through the coda and see if I can find

563
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:33,426
them. But it was like in chapter two,

564
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,820
it was like let's see.

565
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,498
The general thing to me is how can we,

566
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:45,340
among other things, prevent question,

567
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,250
self censorship and filtering?

568
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,774
We know that question isn't just like

569
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:54,202
this one. Genius meets genius.

570
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:56,526
Perfectly framed specific answer that

571
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:58,654
will be understood in one sentence but

572
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:00,834
that question is like a broader space of

573
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:04,610
prompts that don't necessarily have

574
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,626
any prior on whether it has to do with

575
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,594
an application or it could be a

576
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:09,780
technical question.

577
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,914
Yeah, good. It was early. It was like in

578
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:16,566
chapter two and chapter three and there

579
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:18,742
were a lot of questions. I'm trying to

580
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:20,278
look at the specific. I'll have to look

581
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,102
at my own coda instead of watching you

582
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,160
beautiful people.

583
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,614
It just happened early in those

584
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:31,494
meetings. And it's not that there wasn't

585
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,626
time like that. We didn't address the

586
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:34,998
questions in order. It was like let's

587
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:36,198
skip this because it's technical, let's

588
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,766
skip this because it's technical. Let's

589
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:39,246
skip this because it's technical. So I

590
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:40,766
just stopped putting my questions in

591
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:42,430
because I feel like they're technical.

592
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,034
What does this little squiggly symbol

593
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:47,358
mean? And that's why for me the

594
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:51,226
translation of equations into natural

595
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:52,834
language was the most useful thing

596
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:54,930
because I feel like all of my questions

597
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,198
are technical, like related to the math.

598
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:59,198
So I stopped entering them into the coda

599
00:35:59,214 --> 00:36:01,310
because they were just skipped over.

600
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,034
Okay, thanks. Well, yeah, I appreciate

601
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:08,722
it. Again, I personally

602
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,630
hope that we can have structures that

603
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,786
uncouple the perceived importance of

604
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:16,086
real time speech from the contributions

605
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:19,466
that people make so that we can be

606
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,686
really clear about which questions we're

607
00:36:21,718 --> 00:36:23,930
going to be addressing in conversation

608
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,614
and use conversation for what it can

609
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,934
bring many things and

610
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:35,230
then have 200

611
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,746
questions in chapter two with

612
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:42,318
many upvoters or with whatever mechanism

613
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:44,226
that brings different questions to the

614
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:47,506
fore. So there

615
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:49,650
isn't even like the plausibility of

616
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,446
being skipped. It's just a question of

617
00:36:51,468 --> 00:36:53,542
like what will we raise up and focus on

618
00:36:53,596 --> 00:36:56,646
individually and as a group from the

619
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:59,270
many, many questions of different kinds

620
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,634
that support a

621
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:08,186
beginner with fundamentals and a

622
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,618
pre beginner with background and

623
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:13,418
somebody who's asking research questions

624
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:14,300
as well.

625
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,060
So I think one simple thing is

626
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,870
if you go back to the questions table

627
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,274
like you have an interest column

628
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:37,920
here.

629
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,360
Interesting. Yes, even better,

630
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:52,834
maybe there is what

631
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:55,394
we will address in the next coming live

632
00:37:55,432 --> 00:37:58,786
stream or session kind of table that

633
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:00,770
is taken from the questions table.

634
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,000
But the questions table has no such

635
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,414
projection of what is interesting or

636
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:12,034
not, especially in some one dimensional

637
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,900
kind of like yes or no thing.

638
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,510
It's just a separation of random

639
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,686
things, prompts questions and then there

640
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:31,726
is some process to get it to what

641
00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:33,578
will be addressed in the live stream

642
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:41,102
that again,

643
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:43,282
there's ways to try to do things like

644
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:46,542
randomization or trying to like ensure

645
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:50,030
that, you know, we don't continuously

646
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,342
ask focus from one person and

647
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,370
or things like that. The popularity

648
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,120
doesn't kind of win the day.

649
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,058
There's more complex ways to do this

650
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:08,054
that are kind of almost like decision

651
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:12,886
making processes like ephemeral

652
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:15,418
group processes and things like that.

653
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:18,654
But yeah, I think just

654
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,674
separating them it would be helpful.

655
00:39:21,722 --> 00:39:28,642
There at least another

656
00:39:28,696 --> 00:39:30,546
thing might be like zoom, you could do

657
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,674
breakout rooms. Maybe that's not the

658
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:38,398
format. But again, just that's

659
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:39,934
kind of an Ephemeral group processing.

660
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:43,618
Like perhaps everyone doesn't

661
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,320
want to focus on the same questions.

662
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,762
Should there be a temporary

663
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:52,694
split of verging of attention for some

664
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:55,530
short period of time and then recombine?

665
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,394
Don't know what that means for a live

666
00:39:58,432 --> 00:40:03,050
stream or recording precisely but that's

667
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,610
possible solution.

668
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,214
Yeah, thanks. Gather is awesome for

669
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:14,122
these things but it does require clarity

670
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:16,542
around how it's going to be done. Like

671
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:19,998
mass one on one breakouts, mass smaller

672
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:22,786
breakouts and rearranging people using

673
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,250
their spatial location to express

674
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,498
different things and assemble into

675
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:30,770
different Ephemeral teams.

676
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,186
Okay, let's look at some project

677
00:40:50,288 --> 00:40:54,206
ideas. Okay, so for

678
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:55,418
those who are here or not, I hope I'm

679
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:57,120
not misrepresenting anything.

680
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,514
Mike brought up some token economies

681
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:02,958
that's something that we've been

682
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,186
actively going towards in Active

683
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:07,230
Blockprints.

684
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,670
So I'll just add just a note column in

685
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,180
Active Block, for instance,

686
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,430
as well as as mentioned earlier,

687
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,002
working with Noah on some

688
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:35,410
more some related topics.

689
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,070
Okay. Audiobook recording of a textbook

690
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,490
just as we go through these projects.

691
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,262
I've recorded the first chapter and

692
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:50,550
the preface type materials.

693
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,430
Do people think that an audio recording

694
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,090
has utility?

695
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,614
And if so, is anyone interested to

696
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,870
pursue this avenue with blue and eye

697
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,662
because it's very defined and it

698
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:16,278
involves primarily the equations,

699
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:18,394
having natural descriptions and then

700
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:21,594
just reading and

701
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:23,322
it can go many other directions too.

702
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:26,654
But this is like kind

703
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:30,462
of a clear accessibility affordance for

704
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:32,414
different participants that might be

705
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:34,206
interesting as well as just get out

706
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,702
there on YouTube and other channels as

707
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:39,994
having that artifact

708
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:43,360
blue. I do think it's useful obviously,

709
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,766
if I've elected to I didn't realize I

710
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:48,078
signed up to be the participant lead but

711
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:51,480
I'm so happy to do it. Is.

712
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,742
But I do think it's useful as someone

713
00:42:56,796 --> 00:42:59,990
who drives a considerable amount of time

714
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:04,234
every day. If it's not like I'm not

715
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:05,818
a very good auditory learner, but it

716
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:08,582
does help to reinforce the concepts.

717
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:12,618
And I just wanted to mention even if

718
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:14,826
you're not comfortable perhaps doing the

719
00:43:14,848 --> 00:43:17,470
math or reading the textbook,

720
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,266
Daniel thinks he can read it until it's

721
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:24,062
perfect. I would prefer to do

722
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:27,546
some video or audio editing so that's

723
00:43:27,578 --> 00:43:30,370
also an option is to do audio editing

724
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,146
occasionally. Daniel does it very

725
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:35,986
infrequently but I think there's the

726
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:39,074
occasional tripping over a word or

727
00:43:39,272 --> 00:43:41,246
saying a word twice like when you lose

728
00:43:41,278 --> 00:43:43,254
your place or something like that. So

729
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:45,766
video or audio editing, I do it with

730
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,954
Windows video editor. But audio editing

731
00:43:48,002 --> 00:43:49,602
is also another possible affordance

732
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:52,422
there and it would involve reading along

733
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,386
with the textbook to make sure that it's

734
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:56,086
accurate that no sentences are skipped

735
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:58,694
and then to just splice out any mishaps.

736
00:43:58,742 --> 00:44:02,006
Or just ask him to rerecord the Markov

737
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:03,754
blanket for precision just so you can

738
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:06,620
splice it over the trip up if needed.

739
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,486
Yeah, thanks. Definitely we would do a

740
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:12,926
multi part. I just did one pass on

741
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:14,298
the first chapter? No equations, et

742
00:44:14,314 --> 00:44:17,054
cetera. Draft, but okay. Anyways, just

743
00:44:17,092 --> 00:44:21,538
so people who are interested

744
00:44:21,704 --> 00:44:23,858
here or rewatching can know about this.

745
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,290
Okay. Resources for conducting research

746
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,050
or developing active inference agents,

747
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,746
ways to facilitate the starting of that

748
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:32,120
work for participants. Just a seed idea.

749
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,686
A lot of this is going to be explored in

750
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:39,126
part two because

751
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:42,466
it's a recipe for designing the models,

752
00:44:42,498 --> 00:44:43,974
and we'll have a lot of infrastructure

753
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:47,258
around that as well. So I

754
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:50,586
hope whoever wrote this continues in

755
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:54,534
that interest and builds

756
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:56,554
that starting point for conducting

757
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:59,902
research or developing agents based

758
00:44:59,956 --> 00:45:02,334
around what they learn and see in part

759
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:04,240
two. Okay.

760
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,270
Okay. Also,

761
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,738
typing just directly in the code is a

762
00:45:15,744 --> 00:45:16,794
little better than comments, because

763
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:18,154
sometimes it's hard to understand what

764
00:45:18,192 --> 00:45:21,900
the comments are like referring to.

765
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,406
Okay. Complete mathematical overview of

766
00:45:25,428 --> 00:45:28,734
active inference, derivations of key

767
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:32,320
results, maps of equations. Yes.

768
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,226
All awesome. Thank you, Jakub, for

769
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:38,802
suggesting this. I think

770
00:45:38,856 --> 00:45:42,130
the closest related works are

771
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,194
in the active phontology and

772
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:50,614
in knowledge engineering and

773
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:51,880
other areas too,

774
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,910
and I hope that we're on this path.

775
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,498
So however Jacob or anyone else wants to

776
00:46:01,504 --> 00:46:04,438
connect on that. Okay. Active

777
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:08,220
foundations. So here we added this page

778
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,640
if Brock or anyone else wants to add any

779
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,342
comments or describe how

780
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:22,242
some of these comments can be integrated

781
00:46:22,306 --> 00:46:24,360
with textbook group.

782
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,620
Um, short answers. I'm not

783
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,676
entirely sure the precise way to

784
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:40,756
integrate it with the textbook group,

785
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:45,444
but there

786
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:49,684
are just perhaps this is related

787
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:51,930
to questions, making questions,

788
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,090
removing the stigma or whatever. Like,

789
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,292
it's just helpful, I think, to have some

790
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:03,244
affordance or regime of attention or

791
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:06,284
whatever thing that says,

792
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:09,056
hey, if you don't understand this thing

793
00:47:09,078 --> 00:47:11,632
about active inference, that's a

794
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:14,864
foundational thing. Like, okay,

795
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:18,864
I get entropy and

796
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,428
I get energy, like the basic concepts of

797
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:23,748
them, but when you're subtracting them,

798
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,070
what the hell are we talking about?

799
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,332
And then maybe there's some follow

800
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:35,032
on questions about mathematically what

801
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,944
entropy is mathematically, what is

802
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:40,452
energy? Or what is Shannon entropy

803
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,250
specifically? What is the difference?

804
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,090
These sorts of things.

805
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,708
A, it's that an, affordance for that,

806
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:55,400
but B, it's also just acknowledging,

807
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,004
like, there's a wealth of knowledge

808
00:47:59,052 --> 00:48:02,512
already here. It's not a

809
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,500
complete mystery what those background

810
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,020
foundational things are or what learners

811
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,732
might want to get out of some

812
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:16,836
relatively short course to get up to

813
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,940
speed and feel real confident reading

814
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,596
the textbook. And so there's

815
00:48:24,628 --> 00:48:29,892
a kind of top down affordance

816
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:33,096
there too, I think, that needs to be

817
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:36,600
made for people that can say,

818
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,396
hey, there's a bunch of equations over

819
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:41,596
or examples over here that are these are

820
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,852
the most helpful ones I found for

821
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:46,552
understanding what Bayesian inference

822
00:48:46,616 --> 00:48:49,970
really is, how that really works.

823
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,712
So I guess it would be those two

824
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,530
things. But if you look into the project

825
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,790
notes there on that project idea thing,

826
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,956
there's a little more detail

827
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:13,876
of just a couple of bullet points there

828
00:49:13,898 --> 00:49:17,560
of just. It's really hard for people,

829
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,184
I think, to get into a new thing if

830
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:22,884
there's not a model. If you do chemistry

831
00:49:22,932 --> 00:49:26,136
without Bohr's model, good luck. If you

832
00:49:26,158 --> 00:49:27,900
have to jump, especially to something

833
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,556
like electron probability clouds or

834
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:31,996
something, it's just like why would you

835
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:34,428
do that when you have a perfectly good

836
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:38,068
periodic table and simple discrete

837
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:42,480
and it's enough even to do basic physics

838
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,650
like Newtonian stuff. Right.

839
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,016
You need a model. I think a lot of

840
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:53,748
people history is helpful. There very

841
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:56,036
minimal amount, but just this is where

842
00:49:56,058 --> 00:49:57,008
this came from. This is why it's

843
00:49:57,024 --> 00:50:00,372
relevant. It's really hard for people,

844
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:04,020
I think, to blindly calculate

845
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,000
without that sort of simple context.

846
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,504
So I just kind of made a

847
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,176
very rudimentary still kind of

848
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:16,510
scaffolding it,

849
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,804
coda it's already linked in that

850
00:50:21,842 --> 00:50:25,164
project row, but I'll put it in that sub

851
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:27,070
page there too.

852
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,000
Super work in progress.

853
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,328
The idea is just these questions are

854
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,456
going to be asked over and over and over

855
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:41,872
again. There will be people coming from

856
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:44,132
a more mathematical, more physics, more

857
00:50:44,186 --> 00:50:47,472
neuroscience from different backgrounds.

858
00:50:47,616 --> 00:50:51,296
And so why pretend like that's

859
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:52,944
not happening or reinvent the wheel

860
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:54,472
every time somebody asks a question?

861
00:50:54,526 --> 00:50:56,292
Like just having a central resource

862
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,760
where people can get a lot of value,

863
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,216
but also maybe ask a

864
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:06,764
question that's a little more they

865
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:09,464
might not want to ask and seem like it's

866
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:13,070
too simple or it's too whatever in

867
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,500
the live stream.

868
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,130
Okay, thank you.

869
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,976
Any other comments or thoughts on this?

870
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,608
Otherwise we'll just continue on for the

871
00:51:26,614 --> 00:51:30,210
final minutes. Okay.

872
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,804
Textbook enrichment. Yes. I hope

873
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,332
everyone continues to annotate, figure

874
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,940
out also things on their own and explore

875
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,408
and like we're building something really

876
00:51:44,494 --> 00:51:47,816
powerful with annotation. So I hope that

877
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,688
people can continue to be

878
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:55,444
enriching with the structures

879
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:58,990
that we're building. But yes,

880
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,036
so much of what this group has been

881
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:03,352
about has been about textbook enrichment

882
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:09,308
and improvement robot

883
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:10,832
modeling. Unless anyone has other

884
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:14,130
comments, I think learning from JF and

885
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,090
staying in part two will help.

886
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,910
And yeah, Jessica and then anyone else?

887
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,834
Sorry, I think I didn't raise my. Hand

888
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:28,860
from no worries.

889
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,118
Yes. Well, any general comments that

890
00:52:36,144 --> 00:52:37,754
people want to provide on the textbook

891
00:52:37,802 --> 00:52:38,400
group?

892
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,702
I think the live streams are super

893
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:56,854
important for the lab and the whole

894
00:52:56,892 --> 00:53:00,780
space for maybe obvious reason.

895
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,700
The textbook group is equally important.

896
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,170
These are like the two most important

897
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,062
things that can add value to the space

898
00:53:11,136 --> 00:53:12,910
and the lab participants.

899
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,862
Indeed, glad that those who have made it

900
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:21,280
this far see that.

901
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,882
And over

902
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:30,500
the right timescales in the right way,

903
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,006
we see more and more vistas

904
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:37,106
to increase the accessibility and rigor

905
00:53:37,138 --> 00:53:40,614
of active inference. So I hope we can

906
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:44,598
hold that frame and focus

907
00:53:44,684 --> 00:53:49,100
our attention to

908
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,370
provide these functionalities.

909
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,074
Because if it's statable, it's doable in

910
00:53:58,112 --> 00:53:58,780
a way.

911
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,934
And if no one from the first

912
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:06,074
Cohort wants to be an active facilitator

913
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:09,520
or steward for textbook group two,

914
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,126
some of these changes will be

915
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:16,194
integrated. The more people who want

916
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:19,666
to step in to

917
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:23,810
steward in our participatory context

918
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,926
are going to be leverage points for so

919
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:29,720
many more people who come through.

920
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,574
So there's like multiple levels of

921
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,798
affordances for those who see them,

922
00:54:35,964 --> 00:54:38,790
especially at the end of this section.

923
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:43,254
And it's been

924

927
00:54:58,482 --> 00:54:59,964

00:55:00,002 --> 00:55:00,590
