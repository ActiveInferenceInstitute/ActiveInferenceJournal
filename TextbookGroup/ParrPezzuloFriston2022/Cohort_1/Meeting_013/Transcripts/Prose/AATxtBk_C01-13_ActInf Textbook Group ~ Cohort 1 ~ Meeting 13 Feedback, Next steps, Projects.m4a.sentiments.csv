970	2206	A	0.5579421520233154	Hello everyone.
2308	13440	A	0.9311037659645081	It is meeting 13 of the active inference textbook group cohort one.
14290	17870	A	0.9222865104675293	It is the final meeting of this section.
18290	49962	A	0.5283545255661011	It's July 28, 2022 and we are going to be especially thinking about feedback and structuring on this textbook group, on how the first half of the first cohort went and also the ways that over quite literally the coming minutes and hours and days we will be able to implement structures to improve our experience.
50096	57950	A	0.8671286702156067	For those of us who are continuing on to part two cohort One, as well as those who are joining for a new cohort.
59250	81590	A	0.8981605768203735	In the onboarding page there are two columns with checkboxes and clicking these checkboxes will sign you up to continue on in chapter six through ten for cohort one as well as or alternatively to join in chapters one through five with cohort two.
81660	88300	A	0.8994560837745667	So select one or both of these boxes if you'd like to be continuing on.
90590	92774	A	0.8278552889823914	That's the onboarding note.
92902	108590	A	0.6667852401733398	And again, other than that, which I hope those who are here or watching live update according to how they want, other than that we're going to be talking about future Textbook groups and other things like that.
108740	118286	A	0.8241457343101501	And then also just on the informational briefly on the Future Textbook Group page, here's the link to share with people to join future Textbook cohorts.
118398	122914	A	0.8736701011657715	So to join in and then also please fill out this feedback form.
123032	148522	A	0.5368241667747498	It's really important that even if people think they have limited or non valuable feedback, that they provide it because whether it's on this page directly where everyone can edit and so every thought that somebody has like even if right now they can just edit this page or in this more anonymous and asynchronous mode or through direct communication but we're experiencing it.
148656	162190	A	0.7373595237731934	And so we have the best insight at this point into how to improve it and the affordances that we're seeing today or the state updates or however you want to use ontology terms to describe it.
162260	165700	A	0.617354154586792	But what we're seeing today we can do.
166150	188300	A	0.8754569888114929	So we should have a fun discussion today on some of those topics and then also look towards project ideas, many of which are related to the educational process and others which are building on education into research and application and so there will be spaces for those as well.
189390	215970	A	0.7583813667297363	Let's begin though on this Future Textbook Groups page and anywhere where people want to jump in writing or speaking, how are we going to summarize and distill the experience of the last few months in this textbook group and bring it towards improvement in our coming cohorts?
272170	286374	B	0.8694151043891907	Yeah, I think having worked examples as I've talked about and discussed with Brock in Jupyter notebooks or even simple like did you understand the materials?
286422	296594	B	0.5199131369590759	Like question and answer, like quizzes at the end of each chapter or something like that, I think, which just would be useful, like to gauge your own understanding.
296662	302750	B	0.5467533469200134	Like if there is like a definition or something that we can directly refer back to in the text, that'd be useful.
312430	313606	A	0.498546302318573	Examples.
313798	314540	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
316430	317130	A	0.7671424746513367	Great.
317280	322854	A	0.8360134959220886	And the questions could also include little tests of knowledge.
322902	328910	A	0.6347633600234985	Not every question needs to be throwing a baseball into the deep unknown.
329250	342302	A	0.5021880865097046	It can be literally clarifying for someone who believes that an answer is in the known unknown space I believe there's an answer for this, I just want to clarify for my understanding.
342446	358790	A	0.644093930721283	But also once you've clarified that, and especially if you did just clarify it, then write that example because many of these are opportunities for worked examples and worked examples work in certain situations.
359290	372330	A	0.8412721157073975	For formalisms, for example, it might also work for formalisms that aren't mathematical like here's the system this way or this phenomena, how do these ontology terms map?
373630	377840	A	0.803672194480896	Or if this is the blank, then what is the other thing?
385970	393628	A	0.7535974979400635	Okay, so we have anyone else just go for it.
393634	406560	A	0.6813785433769226	Or let's just continue to edit and organize and add notes and just have more because many people are having many thoughts on directions to go and just like what is the space of some improvements that we can explore?
406980	410850	A	0.8873506188392639	And then how will we be implementing some of these changes?
412580	417876	A	0.7759786248207092	And then in cohort two, when someone's like it could be this way and they've thought of something that's new and not on this list, we add it.
417898	428520	A	0.9268865585327148	If it's on this list, we say awesome, we agree, join us and do it's.
489800	491720	A	0.8627603650093079	Anyone else with raised hands?
491790	496600	A	0.8951882719993591	Or we can look more at a few other sections before going to the projects.
518120	534190	A	0.878483772277832	Like when I see different regimes of attention, I think one way that we can structure that is by clarifying what practices we're explicating and where those practices can take place.
539040	555680	A	0.5818206667900085	So then, because the reality is and people who are here or listening in replay can give their input, many people may not have known what exactly to do to engage with the material.
558710	574290	A	0.5463427901268005	There's a textbook, there's some regular meetings, there's an information resource and it's like an infinite game to structure beneficial engagement.
574450	580040	A	0.8370177149772644	And where the rubber hits the road is like being clear about what practices people can engage in.
583210	596090	A	0.8115125894546509	So if we have math, everything has to be fractaled out into sub sub subgroups, just including many of the practices.
596990	610210	A	0.7764265537261963	Like if you want to do art about active inference, here's a practice and then if people are engaging in that practice it does create kind of like a group or a guild engaging in that performance.
613970	631058	A	0.5744506120681763	So however, people think like what are useful minutes and seconds that actually help learning active inference and we'll be able to have a perspective on that question in years from now.
631144	641000	A	0.7791872620582581	That's very different based upon better understandings of competencies and the fundamentals and the approachment to the area.
644600	662090	A	0.8207674026489258	However, I think the practices table and providing feedback and then sharing and communicating how we're using practices to increase understanding could be very important for those who are learning and learning how to learn.
677710	679740	A	0.8492538928985596	Jessica and then anyone else?
682110	683178	C	0.6058623194694519	Hi yes.
683344	700386	C	0.8820178508758545	I think to build up on sort of like blue suggestion, I'm thinking that in some of the courses that I've taken, you have the other participants giving feedback as part of the learning process.
700488	704180	C	0.8939648866653442	You give feedback on the other participants work.
705270	711510	C	0.6745973825454712	So it could be that there's an exercise and everybody has to fill it up, et cetera.
711930	716710	C	0.8748255968093872	And then the other participants, it could be like two or three.
716860	719000	C	0.7114529609680176	So not everybody has to read everything.
721230	722186	C	0.7391706109046936	Two, three people.
722288	728266	C	0.8534978032112122	You read like Jessica's answer and give a feedback and so on.
728448	738480	C	0.6246604323387146	Because in that way, by having to critique or analyze other people's work, it helps you think through the material itself.
741490	744398	C	0.6861947774887085	So that's another way of also learning.
744484	746670	C	0.6329620480537415	Again, there's also missing.
747330	766520	C	0.6291581392288208	You could be probably making a mistake, also not applying it correctly, but it's like a tool to help you think through the material by analyzing somebody else's work while also initially also having to do on yourself and then hearing also the feedback that other people are going to be giving you.
767210	773610	C	0.8371865153312683	So that was kind of like an idea that came to mind, like making reference from other experiences.
777790	778266	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
778288	780540	A	0.49004408717155457	Jessica yes.
788410	807050	A	0.7906359434127808	I think that's a great area to keep in mind and to balance as our cohorts build and so on, who's on the supply and who's on the demand side of that, so to speak.
807120	813630	A	0.7452014684677124	Like, who is actually offering the feedback and then who is the people who are wanting feedback.
814370	844470	A	0.5256099700927734	Like, some of these projects are things where the person was able to be brought into another project like Noah's and Mike's work, bringing them into synchronous and asynchronous resources that are already happening, provided them with at least a first step for continuing on their journey.
846810	850918	A	0.789998471736908	Others are they're in different areas.
850934	873120	A	0.6041445136070251	And so how to keep it open when people have ideas ranging from educational improvements to robotic deployments, what kind of feedback they need, and then how to balance the excitement around applying active inference with what it means to learn.
875810	878046	A	0.813737154006958	Like, there are biochemistry classes.
878158	885570	A	0.5842299461364746	It's not all just biochemistry lab, but who's to say that's even the best way or anything like that?
885640	890710	A	0.7409721612930298	It's just we want to make sure that we keep it all in mind.
890780	901514	C	0.7136865854263306	Jessica yeah, and I think this suggestion is not connected to someone's project or Net 16 project.
901632	903814	C	0.6194617748260498	It's more like an exercise.
903862	911900	C	0.9142998456954956	So there's like a short exercise that it's going to be testing variational inference or something like that.
912990	920822	C	0.855350911617279	And then every participant in the class actually does the exercise.
920966	931310	C	0.8370634317398071	And then it's assigned to other people in the cohort to analyze that person's submission.
931470	937922	C	0.9057319164276123	So it's like three people in the course analyze Jessica's submission and give feedback.
937986	954330	C	0.8348580598831177	And it's going to be like for everybody will be getting three feedback on how they applied the terms, or there are other ways that they could be done, et cetera.
955950	964014	C	0.7037978172302246	If some of the things are like math related I will have to see because then the answer is going to be more clear.
964052	980130	C	0.7872642278671265	It's not going to be as objective but it's more like there's a short exercise, everybody does the exercise and then some people then get to review that answer of the person and give feedback on that.
980200	983060	C	0.813915491104126	So it's like separate from an actual project.
984710	985794	A	0.5329204201698303	Okay, makes sense.
985832	1010746	A	0.7459954619407654	It's kind of like a combination of having good example questions with an organizational structure and then like you said, balancing like where there might be a clearer measuring stick like was this the right equation or the right calculation or not?
1010928	1019360	A	0.838767945766449	Versus how did this usage of affordances in a new context make sense to you?
1020610	1029434	A	0.7783713936805725	And also it's not just about getting feedback on the person's idea.
1029472	1037500	A	0.6282421350479126	It's like the practice of providing constructive, ideally written comments is super important.
1038210	1064360	A	0.6360162496566772	Like the secret side of the questions is the discourse where the kinds of things that questions and ideas that send people on thought excursions and research rabbit holes, we can collaborate on that response together and it doesn't have to be the end all, be all.
1066890	1081450	A	0.8650464415550232	But sometimes by putting like a seed into the workspace, by putting like a prompt or a question, ten people could write for 5 minutes and then there would be 50 minutes of writing on that topic from different perspectives.
1083790	1104690	A	0.849969744682312	Whereas if there's ten people also there could be 5 minutes of discussion which might add more seeds onto the table and it might continue to invoke whimsy or it might continue to instruct if there was a broad uncertainty that that 5 minutes of discourse resolved.
1107350	1131078	C	0.8128023743629456	Yeah, I was going to say I think for the questions it's like somebody has a question that they're trying to understand and everybody's giving the crowdsource answer and helping sense make the meaning of how things are with the other exercise.
1131174	1140080	C	0.8822492957115173	I think similar to I think what Blue wants to do with the short exercises to test whether people know the concept or not.
1141410	1155874	C	0.6356931924819946	It's just like adding by having people critique other people's work and having to critically think through the answer is another level of learning because it's not just like oh, I think this is the answer to this.
1155912	1177000	C	0.7035218477249146	It's like, no, I really have to understand one, the concept that I'm using to evaluate an answer and then also evaluate that person's answer and kind of compare and contrast and having to make that exercise of critical thinking.
1177630	1191230	C	0.49928078055381775	I think helps people learn in a more in depth way because you have to think through your own thinking process and what things mean, what somebody else was saying, et cetera.
1193250	1196058	C	0.7982804775238037	And I've seen it apply to writing.
1196154	1207940	C	0.6148225665092468	I mean, I guess it's maybe easier to writing courses and things like that, but yeah, it's like another way of processing through the information.
1209430	1222630	C	0.6644251346588135	And then also it also maybe reduces the burden on maybe, like, a person having to go through everybody's answer and making sure I'm the teacher, correcting everybody's answers.
1223370	1236330	C	0.8560888767242432	You're sharing the responsibility around everybody in the group of answering, evaluating people's responses to an exercise.
1238510	1239506	A	0.9182145595550537	Thank you, Brock.
1239558	1241360	A	0.8294999599456787	And then anyone else with the right hand.
1246690	1249066	D	0.498202383518219	Just to agree with Jessica.
1249098	1272326	D	0.7071483135223389	And the last part, I was going to add that, but yeah, just systematically creating a systematic affordance for people to review or provide some validation that it's correct or on the right path or whatever will reduce the burden there.
1272428	1285050	D	0.8402191996574402	And teaching is probably the best way to learn it's.
1287630	1293870	D	0.5030066967010498	Learning how to learn is like difficult to do without teaching.
1295490	1303380	D	0.6015180945396423	Like learning self learning is about teaching yourself to get better at teaching, you get better at teaching yourself.
1304310	1305060	D	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
1314250	1316214	D	0.7491486072540283	Just the circle back.
1316252	1326520	D	0.8707426190376282	That does kind of require some meta structure to create examples or source them or whatever and then provide them.
1329550	1347600	D	0.7055357694625854	So I'm not sure outside of the project that I put on there and maybe it's kind of related to Yakubs as well, but outside of those two things, I'm not sure we have a clear affordance to do that yet.
1349570	1353054	A	0.7353929877281189	For coming up with examples of yeah.
1353092	1354818	D	0.8295177221298218	Like examples to work or whatever?
1354904	1364580	D	0.879249095916748	Yeah, either sourcing them and then putting them in a structure that says, oh, this is for section chapter one or whatever 1.1 or whatever.
1365350	1371494	A	0.6995759606361389	So not questions that are related to specific parts of the textbook with people to work through, but what kind of.
1371532	1376006	D	0.8611628413200378	Table or structure could be, I guess virtually the same.
1376108	1388540	D	0.8201717138290405	But instead of a question somebody is asking, it's an example for other people to answer, maybe with an answer that they can see, like if they want to reveal it or whatever.
1389310	1390794	D	0.7228710055351257	Does that make sense?
1390992	1396910	A	0.5573555827140808	Yes, it could be an example to work through in this course.
1396980	1409410	A	0.6845950484275818	It doesn't be in this exact table, but just make sure that we have written it down and everyone can be contributing to write it down and what the structure is because it's not like this is an impossible affordance.
1410230	1413906	A	0.8395905494689941	We can spin up the table right now and template it and just start to design it.
1413928	1420374	A	0.7949035167694092	And over the coming weeks we have time to digest all these different inputs to make it.
1420412	1426760	A	0.6213274002075195	So in a few weeks it will fly by, but we might be able to be implementing these things.
1431150	1444702	A	0.782987654209137	I wanted to ask, what practices did people feel like they engaged in fruitfully, whether it's on here or not.
1444836	1450900	A	0.8672167658805847	Just when you you felt like were participating in the active textbook group, what did you feel like you were doing and how did it help?
1451270	1452590	B	0.7937629818916321	Equation translation?
1452670	1458854	B	0.892734944820404	That was like the most helpful thing that I did and I don't think it's there.
1459052	1460822	B	0.7802985906600952	Well, I guess it's kind of there.
1460956	1471980	B	0.6436567902565002	It was like to copy the equations down, but putting them into natural language was probably like the thing that I did that was maybe most useful for myself and others.
1477070	1480810	A	0.9688428044319153	Yep, it was a great practice.
1481150	1491054	A	0.4839818775653839	And it it leads to and scaffolds so many other why is it this way?
1491092	1491694	A	0.7871557474136353	What does this mean?
1491732	1492606	A	0.7956757545471191	What are the examples?
1492638	1495378	A	0.6514819264411926	It's not like the prerequisite per se.
1495544	1499170	A	0.7462664246559143	It's possible to ask questions without having the natural language description.
1500070	1512946	A	0.5928035974502563	But whether it's a basic or a multiline equation, it helps bring consilience to that discussion.
1513138	1518922	A	0.6562312841415405	Because there's a non zero probability that then a term is going to be used loosely or it's going to be used one way.
1518976	1541280	A	0.6641588807106018	Then it's going to be conversationally used slightly differently, or people will not agree on which ontology terms are invoked or not, which can then have every equation start to spiral off into every possible ontology term, and they very well might actually connect that way.
1541590	1555750	A	0.6857760548591614	But being able to see what is variational free energy, and if there's some term that is being connected to variational free energy that's not being described in the equation, that's fine.
1555900	1562840	A	0.7165806293487549	Like least squared error isn't in the linear regression y equals MX plus b.
1563290	1572090	A	0.6092724204063416	So there can be formal and informal concepts that are super important for understanding that aren't with a symbol.
1572830	1579760	A	0.8259466886520386	But this was a great way to be clear what the symbols actually are.
1592390	1601210	A	0.7804365158081055	What other practices did people feel like they benefited from?
1603580	1608810	A	0.8589094877243042	What would they recommend for a daily schedule for somebody who wanted to learn a lot.
1637740	1638650	D	0.6888490915298462	I think.
1639420	1665250	D	0.7475481033325195	Plus one there on blues, like writing the equations, which is like maybe a super simple but open ended, almost kind of version of Jessica's suggestion, but also in general, just adding stuff to the coda, asking questions.
1666900	1676132	D	0.6423577666282654	Like if you read and you don't ask a question, did you really grapple with it at all?
1676186	1677030	D	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
1682280	1685312	A	0.7289272546768188	How do we improve thinking by writing?
1685376	1707310	A	0.577484130859375	And the actual number of typed words that people add in as a proxy during a discussion is one thing, but even just afterwards, or on their own time frame, how can we have ten people who do read a chapter just scaling numbers?
1708320	1723008	A	0.8073880076408386	Each of them could think of several questions ranging from simple I wasn't sure about to simple again, like more like an example one like what are the three kinds of this?
1723174	1727380	A	0.7441901564598083	And it's totally known and their answer is fully listed to research your questions.
1727450	1736710	A	0.7359961867332458	But how could we have many more inputs in terms of the questions that people are asking?
1737260	1745796	A	0.5232795476913452	Do people feel like they wrote questions in their own notes but didn't bring it into shared workspace?
1745828	1752540	A	0.6227967739105225	Or do people feel like for themselves or others that they observed that the questions weren't actually phrased?
1755560	1757430	A	0.7751801609992981	Jessica then anyone else?
1760120	1764740	C	0.8914820551872253	I was going to share more about the student practices.
1765240	1791970	C	0.5188581347465515	But I guess first of all, the last question you mentioned there were things that I didn't put in the general textbook thing, which were more about parsing information, which was like helping me connect the dots and synthesize information, which Ali actually helped me a lot also with some of that.
1792420	1802740	C	0.827494204044342	But those things were sort of like personal for me to try to make sense of the material in terms of the student practices.
1807400	1820730	C	0.9080702662467957	Initially I was thinking to do every day like an hour each for the reading and maybe like an hour for the math to kind of get foundational things.
1822300	1834270	C	0.6596189737319946	But then I found it was better for me to maybe dedicate, like, a longer period of time on one day or two days for the reading, as opposed to, like, a little bit of the reading or chunk more.
1834800	1841904	C	0.8697295784950256	Two, 3 hours in one day and then maybe follow up another day with a longer period of reading as well.
1841942	1843804	C	0.6531916856765747	Instead of daily reading.
1843852	1844850	C	0.6881384253501892	A little bit.
1847140	1864090	C	0.7633178234100342	And I think that's more because I guess for memory I mean, they do say to do like repetition for memory but I think for me it's like well read longer and have the material fresh in your mind as reading as opposed to going every day.
1865340	1875092	C	0.5665930509567261	And then for the math, because I guess there's less of keeping the material press in your mind daily.
1875156	1876536	C	0.7737480998039246	I was trying to do that.
1876638	1880312	C	0.5201789736747742	So then it fell off a little bit on that part.
1880446	1887660	C	0.652956485748291	But yeah, at least it wasn't every day but four days a week, at least like an hour or so trying to focus on the math.
1888260	1898370	C	0.7452799081802368	But yeah, that's kind of how my practice got developed over time through the course.
1948660	1967130	A	0.6670713424682617	So the textbook is for as the research people who want to apply in their research, if we remember from the introduction, provide readers with the ability to understand and use active inference in their own research.
1971430	1978850	A	0.6873819828033447	We'll have a better sense after part two with a more applied slide.
1984330	1991320	A	0.940474271774292	Who might the next cohort of the textbook group be in and communicate to?
1994010	2029180	A	0.5979138612747192	Yes, over many iterations and, you know, can go many ways, but when people are thinking like in the next few weeks who blue wrote, okay, can we review which questions and understand because I don't quite understand how.
2032990	2036038	B	0.9003458023071289	If you want to check out the questions, check out chapter two.
2036144	2041390	B	0.7463933825492859	And a lot of the questions were so if you scroll down, keep scrolling, keep scrolling.
2042450	2046906	B	0.7494788765907288	I'm trying to think about which ones that were skipped.
2046938	2047760	B	0.6069515347480774	Let's see.
2048770	2054802	A	0.769066572189331	And also there's no skipping there's what we can address in the 1 hour or 2 hours, right.
2054936	2058260	A	0.5056846141815186	So we can raise our attention to all the important questions.
2058790	2065378	B	0.6854656338691711	Yeah, it was just like and then I realized most of my questions were of a largely technical nature.
2065554	2069734	B	0.8889514207839966	So let me scroll through the coda and see if I can find them.
2069772	2075820	B	0.8259487152099609	But it was like in chapter two, it was like let's see.
2078830	2088250	A	0.6516277194023132	The general thing to me is how can we, among other things, prevent question, self censorship and filtering?
2090190	2092494	A	0.7152164578437805	We know that question isn't just like this one.
2092612	2094202	A	0.4970083236694336	Genius meets genius.
2094346	2109780	A	0.6493980288505554	Perfectly framed specific answer that will be understood in one sentence but that question is like a broader space of prompts that don't necessarily have any prior on whether it has to do with an application or it could be a technical question.
2112470	2113330	A	0.8861812949180603	Yeah, good.
2113480	2114242	B	0.7157726883888245	It was early.
2114296	2117862	B	0.6586124897003174	It was like in chapter two and chapter three and there were a lot of questions.
2117996	2119606	B	0.7711718082427979	I'm trying to look at the specific.
2119708	2123160	B	0.4550758898258209	I'll have to look at my own coda instead of watching you beautiful people.
2126490	2129518	B	0.84439617395401	It just happened early in those meetings.
2129714	2132714	B	0.6892575025558472	And it's not that there wasn't time like that.
2132752	2134442	B	0.5486336946487427	We didn't address the questions in order.
2134496	2137398	B	0.4979267716407776	It was like let's skip this because it's technical, let's skip this because it's technical.
2137494	2138902	B	0.6296845078468323	Let's skip this because it's technical.
2138966	2142430	B	0.7193140983581543	So I just stopped putting my questions in because I feel like they're technical.
2142930	2145438	B	0.7870736122131348	What does this little squiggly symbol mean?
2145524	2157198	B	0.8847436904907227	And that's why for me the translation of equations into natural language was the most useful thing because I feel like all of my questions are technical, like related to the math.
2157374	2161310	B	0.5898295044898987	So I stopped entering them into the coda because they were just skipped over.
2161480	2162278	A	0.6231660842895508	Okay, thanks.
2162364	2164680	A	0.9262835383415222	Well, yeah, I appreciate it.
2165530	2204820	A	0.538844108581543	Again, I personally hope that we can have structures that uncouple the perceived importance of real time speech from the contributions that people make so that we can be really clear about which questions we're going to be addressing in conversation and use conversation for what it can bring many things and then have 200 questions in chapter two with many upvoters or with whatever mechanism that brings different questions to the fore.
2206950	2210446	A	0.639156699180603	So there isn't even like the plausibility of being skipped.
2210478	2234300	A	0.8539723753929138	It's just a question of like what will we raise up and focus on individually and as a group from the many, many questions of different kinds that support a beginner with fundamentals and a pre beginner with background and somebody who's asking research questions as well.
2244030	2257920	D	0.8427301049232483	So I think one simple thing is if you go back to the questions table like you have an interest column here.
2261010	2261854	D	0.7792782783508301	Interesting.
2262052	2280770	D	0.9143319725990295	Yes, even better, maybe there is what we will address in the next coming live stream or session kind of table that is taken from the questions table.
2282330	2295900	D	0.5934827327728271	But the questions table has no such projection of what is interesting or not, especially in some one dimensional kind of like yes or no thing.
2298110	2334840	D	0.8528724908828735	It's just a separation of random things, prompts questions and then there is some process to get it to what will be addressed in the live stream that again, there's ways to try to do things like randomization or trying to like ensure that, you know, we don't continuously ask focus from one person and or things like that.
2335210	2338120	D	0.5522177219390869	The popularity doesn't kind of win the day.
2341130	2355418	D	0.810824990272522	There's more complex ways to do this that are kind of almost like decision making processes like ephemeral group processes and things like that.
2355504	2361674	D	0.5056734681129456	But yeah, I think just separating them it would be helpful.
2361722	2371566	D	0.6524240970611572	There at least another thing might be like zoom, you could do breakout rooms.
2371678	2373518	D	0.5624385476112366	Maybe that's not the format.
2373694	2379934	D	0.7679301500320435	But again, just that's kind of an Ephemeral group processing.
2379982	2385320	D	0.6286625266075134	Like perhaps everyone doesn't want to focus on the same questions.
2386170	2395530	D	0.901992917060852	Should there be a temporary split of verging of attention for some short period of time and then recombine?
2396430	2405610	D	0.7772834897041321	Don't know what that means for a live stream or recording precisely but that's possible solution.
2407410	2408640	A	0.6345008015632629	Yeah, thanks.
2409730	2415934	A	0.6899322867393494	Gather is awesome for these things but it does require clarity around how it's going to be done.
2416132	2430770	A	0.8704254627227783	Like mass one on one breakouts, mass smaller breakouts and rearranging people using their spatial location to express different things and assemble into different Ephemeral teams.
2445310	2451210	A	0.7180761098861694	Okay, let's look at some project ideas.
2452270	2457120	A	0.7705731987953186	Okay, so for those who are here or not, I hope I'm not misrepresenting anything.
2458690	2467230	A	0.5102531909942627	Mike brought up some token economies that's something that we've been actively going towards in Active Blockprints.
2473570	2495410	A	0.8994234800338745	So I'll just add just a note column in Active Block, for instance, as well as as mentioned earlier, working with Noah on some more some related topics.
2496870	2497620	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2498870	2503490	A	0.8730452060699463	Audiobook recording of a textbook just as we go through these projects.
2504390	2510550	A	0.916482150554657	I've recorded the first chapter and the preface type materials.
2512570	2520090	A	0.5902537107467651	Do people think that an audio recording has utility?
2524570	2543322	A	0.7283850908279419	And if so, is anyone interested to pursue this avenue with blue and eye because it's very defined and it involves primarily the equations, having natural descriptions and then just reading and it can go many other directions too.
2543376	2560750	A	0.8141288757324219	But this is like kind of a clear accessibility affordance for different participants that might be interesting as well as just get out there on YouTube and other channels as having that artifact blue.
2561170	2569520	B	0.9495635032653809	I do think it's useful obviously, if I've elected to I didn't realize I signed up to be the participant lead but I'm so happy to do it.
2570730	2571480	C	0.5289999842643738	Is.
2574730	2581240	B	0.50556880235672	But I do think it's useful as someone who drives a considerable amount of time every day.
2582410	2588582	B	0.5735100507736206	If it's not like I'm not a very good auditory learner, but it does help to reinforce the concepts.
2588726	2600974	B	0.5447102189064026	And I just wanted to mention even if you're not comfortable perhaps doing the math or reading the textbook, Daniel thinks he can read it until it's perfect.
2601172	2613006	B	0.7021036744117737	I would prefer to do some video or audio editing so that's also an option is to do audio editing occasionally.
2613198	2622886	B	0.5797809958457947	Daniel does it very infrequently but I think there's the occasional tripping over a word or saying a word twice like when you lose your place or something like that.
2622988	2626866	B	0.8398744463920593	So video or audio editing, I do it with Windows video editor.
2626898	2638694	B	0.7591540217399597	But audio editing is also another possible affordance there and it would involve reading along with the textbook to make sure that it's accurate that no sentences are skipped and then to just splice out any mishaps.
2638742	2646620	B	0.9033201932907104	Or just ask him to rerecord the Markov blanket for precision just so you can splice it over the trip up if needed.
2647550	2648318	A	0.6345008015632629	Yeah, thanks.
2648404	2650640	A	0.5618738532066345	Definitely we would do a multi part.
2651650	2653466	A	0.8537542819976807	I just did one pass on the first chapter?
2653498	2654682	A	0.7524220943450928	No equations, et cetera.
2654746	2656014	A	0.6337411999702454	Draft, but okay.
2656132	2663858	A	0.6513990759849548	Anyways, just so people who are interested here or rewatching can know about this.
2663944	2664578	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2664744	2670654	A	0.6821041107177734	Resources for conducting research or developing active inference agents, ways to facilitate the starting of that work for participants.
2670702	2672120	A	0.7788913249969482	Just a seed idea.
2673690	2685180	A	0.7722610235214233	A lot of this is going to be explored in part two because it's a recipe for designing the models, and we'll have a lot of infrastructure around that as well.
2686590	2702960	A	0.6115161180496216	So I hope whoever wrote this continues in that interest and builds that starting point for conducting research or developing agents based around what they learn and see in part two.
2703490	2704240	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2710010	2710760	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2712570	2721900	A	0.495924711227417	Also, typing just directly in the code is a little better than comments, because sometimes it's hard to understand what the comments are like referring to.
2723730	2724142	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2724196	2730590	A	0.8311806917190552	Complete mathematical overview of active inference, derivations of key results, maps of equations.
2731570	2732320	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
2733090	2733950	A	0.9588356614112854	All awesome.
2734020	2736340	A	0.9497483968734741	Thank you, Jakub, for suggesting this.
2738230	2757910	A	0.8416762351989746	I think the closest related works are in the active phontology and in knowledge engineering and other areas too, and I hope that we're on this path.
2759210	2762460	A	0.8979731202125549	So however Jacob or anyone else wants to connect on that.
2762830	2763674	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2763872	2765210	A	0.7121959328651428	Active foundations.
2766190	2784360	A	0.8908384442329407	So here we added this page if Brock or anyone else wants to add any comments or describe how some of these comments can be integrated with textbook group.
2791780	2795088	D	0.6163820028305054	Um, short answers.
2795104	2815272	D	0.781393826007843	I'm not entirely sure the precise way to integrate it with the textbook group, but there are just perhaps this is related to questions, making questions, removing the stigma or whatever.
2815406	2833072	D	0.4911995828151703	Like, it's just helpful, I think, to have some affordance or regime of attention or whatever thing that says, hey, if you don't understand this thing about active inference, that's a foundational thing.
2833206	2846070	D	0.7631339430809021	Like, okay, I get entropy and I get energy, like the basic concepts of them, but when you're subtracting them, what the hell are we talking about?
2847400	2858280	D	0.8682624101638794	And then maybe there's some follow on questions about mathematically what entropy is mathematically, what is energy?
2858350	2861044	D	0.8480392098426819	Or what is Shannon entropy specifically?
2861092	2862250	D	0.7946794629096985	What is the difference?
2862620	2864090	D	0.644473135471344	These sorts of things.
2868640	2879970	D	0.5234013199806213	A, it's that an, affordance for that, but B, it's also just acknowledging, like, there's a wealth of knowledge already here.
2880660	2902180	D	0.5576739311218262	It's not a complete mystery what those background foundational things are or what learners might want to get out of some relatively short course to get up to speed and feel real confident reading the textbook.
2903580	2929970	D	0.7420371174812317	And so there's a kind of top down affordance there too, I think, that needs to be made for people that can say, hey, there's a bunch of equations over or examples over here that are these are the most helpful ones I found for understanding what Bayesian inference really is, how that really works.
2932100	2936224	D	0.7759997248649597	So I guess it would be those two things.
2936342	2954630	D	0.8659659624099731	But if you look into the project notes there on that project idea thing, there's a little more detail of just a couple of bullet points there of just.
2955740	2961544	D	0.5938442945480347	It's really hard for people, I think, to get into a new thing if there's not a model.
2961742	2965572	D	0.6415084004402161	If you do chemistry without Bohr's model, good luck.
2965716	2984992	D	0.5312915444374084	If you have to jump, especially to something like electron probability clouds or something, it's just like why would you do that when you have a perfectly good periodic table and simple discrete and it's enough even to do basic physics like Newtonian stuff.
2985046	2985650	D	0.5664745569229126	Right.
2987460	2988690	D	0.7264289259910583	You need a model.
2989140	2992784	D	0.7738228440284729	I think a lot of people history is helpful.
2992832	2996516	D	0.8182775378227234	There very minimal amount, but just this is where this came from.
2996538	2997780	D	0.6696819067001343	This is why it's relevant.
2998920	3007000	D	0.5956000685691833	It's really hard for people, I think, to blindly calculate without that sort of simple context.
3008860	3027070	D	0.8566160798072815	So I just kind of made a very rudimentary still kind of scaffolding it, coda it's already linked in that project row, but I'll put it in that sub page there too.
3027760	3030000	D	0.7399805188179016	Super work in progress.
3034420	3040000	D	0.6689732670783997	The idea is just these questions are going to be asked over and over and over again.
3040150	3047472	D	0.7418617010116577	There will be people coming from a more mathematical, more physics, more neuroscience from different backgrounds.
3047616	3054472	D	0.5310332775115967	And so why pretend like that's not happening or reinvent the wheel every time somebody asks a question?
3054526	3075500	D	0.6047484874725342	Like just having a central resource where people can get a lot of value, but also maybe ask a question that's a little more they might not want to ask and seem like it's too simple or it's too whatever in the live stream.
3078580	3080130	A	0.7883908748626709	Okay, thank you.
3082980	3084976	A	0.8187223076820374	Any other comments or thoughts on this?
3084998	3087410	A	0.7342125773429871	Otherwise we'll just continue on for the final minutes.
3089460	3090210	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3091880	3093380	A	0.7885697484016418	Textbook enrichment.
3093960	3094372	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3094426	3106280	A	0.929736316204071	I hope everyone continues to annotate, figure out also things on their own and explore and like we're building something really powerful with annotation.
3106940	3116510	A	0.9449154734611511	So I hope that people can continue to be enriching with the structures that we're building.
3118000	3129756	A	0.68780517578125	But yes, so much of what this group has been about has been about textbook enrichment and improvement robot modeling.
3129788	3137090	A	0.5736227035522461	Unless anyone has other comments, I think learning from JF and staying in part two will help.
3138100	3141910	A	0.8402999043464661	And yeah, Jessica and then anyone else?
3146030	3147626	C	0.7121049165725708	Sorry, I think I didn't raise my.
3147648	3148860	A	0.7455078363418579	Hand from no worries.
3152590	3153194	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3153312	3158400	A	0.9085671901702881	Well, any general comments that people want to provide on the textbook group?
3171850	3180780	D	0.9082974195480347	I think the live streams are super important for the lab and the whole space for maybe obvious reason.
3181230	3184700	D	0.5576061010360718	The textbook group is equally important.
3186190	3192910	D	0.9072104096412659	These are like the two most important things that can add value to the space and the lab participants.
3195730	3201280	A	0.9369414448738098	Indeed, glad that those who have made it this far see that.
3202850	3218550	A	0.7524305582046509	And over the right timescales in the right way, we see more and more vistas to increase the accessibility and rigor of active inference.
3219610	3231370	A	0.5866326093673706	So I hope we can hold that frame and focus our attention to provide these functionalities.
3233550	3238780	A	0.7665192484855652	Because if it's statable, it's doable in a way.
3240590	3252990	A	0.5553328990936279	And if no one from the first Cohort wants to be an active facilitator or steward for textbook group two, some of these changes will be integrated.
3253430	3269720	A	0.7842809557914734	The more people who want to step in to steward in our participatory context are going to be leverage points for so many more people who come through.
3271530	3278790	A	0.8514181971549988	So there's like multiple levels of affordances for those who see them, especially at the end of this section.
3279450	3284600	A	0.627753734588623	And it's been quite a few months.
3288700	3291000	A	0.8024787306785583	Any last comments?
3296760	3300590	A	0.6749760508537292	Okay, I'm going stop the recording in 3 seconds unless somebody wants to say something.
3307800	3308550	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
