970	188300	00:00	It is meeting 13 of the active inference textbook group cohort one. It's July 28, 2022 and we are going to be especially thinking about feedback and structuring on this textbook group. Here's the link to share with people to join future Textbook cohorts. Please fill out this feedback form.	This is meeting 13 of the active inference textbook group cohort one	Onboarding to the Future Textbook Group
189390	778266	03:09	How are we going to distill the experience of the last few months in this textbook group and bring it towards improvement in our coming cohorts? Like question and answer, like quizzes at the end of each chapter or something like that. The practices table and providing feedback could be very important for those who are learning and learning how to learn.	How are we going to summarize and distill experience in this textbook group	The Future Textbook Group
778288	1426760	12:58	Brock: How to balance excitement around applying active inference with what it means to learn. How to keep it open when people have ideas ranging from educational improvements to robotic deployments. And also the practice of providing constructive, ideally written comments is super important.	Brock: How do we balance providing constructive feedback with learning	Critical Inquiry in the Learning Process
1431150	1579760	23:51	Equation translation? That was like the most helpful thing that I did and I don't think it's there. Putting them into natural language was probably the thing that was maybe most useful for myself and others. It it leads to and scaffolds so many other why is it this way?	Putting equations into natural language helps bring consilience to a discussion	The Active Textbook Group
1592390	2430770	26:32	What other practices did people feel like they benefited from? What would they recommend for a daily schedule for somebody who wanted to learn a lot? How could we have many more inputs in terms of the questions that people are asking? Who might the next cohort of the textbook group be in and communicate to?	Jessica: What other practices did people feel like they benefited from	A Day in the Life of Math
2445310	3087410	40:45	Audio recording of a textbook. Audiobook recording of the first chapter. Resources for conducting research or developing active inference agents. Ways to facilitate the starting of that work for participants. A lot of this will be explored in part two.	Shannon: I would prefer to do some video or audio editing	Projects in the Active Inference Block
3089460	3153194	51:29	Much of this group has been about textbook enrichment and improvement robot modeling. I hope everyone continues to annotate, figure out also things on their own and explore. Like we're building something really powerful with annotation.	Much of this group has been about textbook enrichment and improvement robot modeling	In the Elevator With Annotations
3153312	3308550	52:33	Live streams are super important for the lab and the whole space for maybe obvious reason. The textbook group is equally important. If no one from the first Cohort wants to be an active facilitator or steward for textbook group two, some of these changes will be integrated.	Live streams are super important for the lab and the whole space	The Live Stream and the Textbook Group
