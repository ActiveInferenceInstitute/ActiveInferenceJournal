970	2206	1	A	0.58	Hello everyone.
2308	13440	2	A	0.99662	It is meeting 13 of the active inference textbook group cohort one.
14290	17870	3	A	0.99965	It is the final meeting of this section.
18290	49962	4	A	0.99496	It's July 28, 2022 and we are going to be especially thinking about feedback and structuring on this textbook group, on how the first half of the first cohort went and also the ways that over quite literally the coming minutes and hours and days we will be able to implement structures to improve our experience.
50096	57950	5	A	0.99997	For those of us who are continuing on to part two cohort One, as well as those who are joining for a new cohort.
59250	81590	6	A	1.0	In the onboarding page there are two columns with checkboxes and clicking these checkboxes will sign you up to continue on in chapter six through ten for cohort one as well as or alternatively to join in chapters one through five with cohort two.
81660	88300	7	A	0.51917	So select one or both of these boxes if you'd like to be continuing on.
90590	92774	8	A	0.92192	That's the onboarding note.
92902	108590	9	A	1.0	And again, other than that, which I hope those who are here or watching live update according to how they want, other than that we're going to be talking about future Textbook groups and other things like that.
108740	118286	10	A	0.55	And then also just on the informational briefly on the Future Textbook Group page, here's the link to share with people to join future Textbook cohorts.
118398	122914	11	A	0.96632	So to join in and then also please fill out this feedback form.
123032	148522	12	A	0.90267	It's really important that even if people think they have limited or non valuable feedback, that they provide it because whether it's on this page directly where everyone can edit and so every thought that somebody has like even if right now they can just edit this page or in this more anonymous and asynchronous mode or through direct communication but we're experiencing it.
148656	162190	13	A	1.0	And so we have the best insight at this point into how to improve it and the affordances that we're seeing today or the state updates or however you want to use ontology terms to describe it.
162260	165700	14	A	0.99999	But what we're seeing today we can do.
166150	188300	15	A	0.59569	So we should have a fun discussion today on some of those topics and then also look towards project ideas, many of which are related to the educational process and others which are building on education into research and application and so there will be spaces for those as well.
189390	215970	16	A	0.96924	Let's begin though on this Future Textbook Groups page and anywhere where people want to jump in writing or speaking, how are we going to summarize and distill the experience of the last few months in this textbook group and bring it towards improvement in our coming cohorts?
272170	286374	17	B	0.99	Yeah, I think having worked examples as I've talked about and discussed with Brock in Jupyter notebooks or even simple like did you understand the materials?
286422	296594	18	B	0.99412	Like question and answer, like quizzes at the end of each chapter or something like that, I think, which just would be useful, like to gauge your own understanding.
296662	302750	19	B	0.90909	Like if there is like a definition or something that we can directly refer back to in the text, that'd be useful.
312430	313606	20	A	0.99584	Examples.
313798	314540	21	A	0.90296	Yes.
316430	317130	22	A	0.99983	Great.
317280	322854	23	A	1.0	And the questions could also include little tests of knowledge.
322902	328910	24	A	0.99991	Not every question needs to be throwing a baseball into the deep unknown.
329250	342302	25	A	0.98578	It can be literally clarifying for someone who believes that an answer is in the known unknown space I believe there's an answer for this, I just want to clarify for my understanding.
342446	358790	26	A	0.99999	But also once you've clarified that, and especially if you did just clarify it, then write that example because many of these are opportunities for worked examples and worked examples work in certain situations.
359290	372330	27	A	0.62632	For formalisms, for example, it might also work for formalisms that aren't mathematical like here's the system this way or this phenomena, how do these ontology terms map?
373630	377840	28	A	0.99	Or if this is the blank, then what is the other thing?
385970	393628	29	A	0.91	Okay, so we have anyone else just go for it.
393634	406560	30	A	1.0	Or let's just continue to edit and organize and add notes and just have more because many people are having many thoughts on directions to go and just like what is the space of some improvements that we can explore?
406980	410850	31	A	1.0	And then how will we be implementing some of these changes?
412580	417876	32	A	0.95	And then in cohort two, when someone's like it could be this way and they've thought of something that's new and not on this list, we add it.
417898	428520	33	A	0.99983	If it's on this list, we say awesome, we agree, join us and do it's.
489800	491720	34	A	0.99818	Anyone else with raised hands?
491790	496600	35	A	1.0	Or we can look more at a few other sections before going to the projects.
518120	534190	36	A	0.87931	Like when I see different regimes of attention, I think one way that we can structure that is by clarifying what practices we're explicating and where those practices can take place.
539040	555680	37	A	0.96807	So then, because the reality is and people who are here or listening in replay can give their input, many people may not have known what exactly to do to engage with the material.
558710	574290	38	A	0.99328	There's a textbook, there's some regular meetings, there's an information resource and it's like an infinite game to structure beneficial engagement.
574450	580040	39	A	1.0	And where the rubber hits the road is like being clear about what practices people can engage in.
583210	596090	40	A	0.99983	So if we have math, everything has to be fractaled out into sub sub subgroups, just including many of the practices.
596990	610210	41	A	0.95684	Like if you want to do art about active inference, here's a practice and then if people are engaging in that practice it does create kind of like a group or a guild engaging in that performance.
613970	631058	42	A	0.99885	So however, people think like what are useful minutes and seconds that actually help learning active inference and we'll be able to have a perspective on that question in years from now.
631144	641000	43	A	0.85574	That's very different based upon better understandings of competencies and the fundamentals and the approachment to the area.
644600	662090	44	A	0.99999	However, I think the practices table and providing feedback and then sharing and communicating how we're using practices to increase understanding could be very important for those who are learning and learning how to learn.
677710	679740	45	A	0.99232	Jessica and then anyone else?
682110	683178	46	C	0.5915	Hi yes.
683344	700386	47	C	1.0	I think to build up on sort of like blue suggestion, I'm thinking that in some of the courses that I've taken, you have the other participants giving feedback as part of the learning process.
700488	704180	48	C	1.0	You give feedback on the other participants work.
705270	711510	49	C	0.91006	So it could be that there's an exercise and everybody has to fill it up, et cetera.
711930	716710	50	C	1.0	And then the other participants, it could be like two or three.
716860	719000	51	C	0.99767	So not everybody has to read everything.
721230	722186	52	C	0.57	Two, three people.
722288	728266	53	C	0.99	You read like Jessica's answer and give a feedback and so on.
728448	738480	54	C	0.47309	Because in that way, by having to critique or analyze other people's work, it helps you think through the material itself.
741490	744398	55	C	0.78411	So that's another way of also learning.
744484	746670	56	C	0.99997	Again, there's also missing.
747330	766520	57	C	0.55	You could be probably making a mistake, also not applying it correctly, but it's like a tool to help you think through the material by analyzing somebody else's work while also initially also having to do on yourself and then hearing also the feedback that other people are going to be giving you.
767210	773610	58	C	0.86323	So that was kind of like an idea that came to mind, like making reference from other experiences.
777790	778266	59	A	0.99996	Thank you.
778288	780540	60	A	0.9851	Jessica yes.
788410	807050	61	A	0.99	I think that's a great area to keep in mind and to balance as our cohorts build and so on, who's on the supply and who's on the demand side of that, so to speak.
807120	813630	62	A	0.91511	Like, who is actually offering the feedback and then who is the people who are wanting feedback.
814370	844470	63	A	0.91859	Like, some of these projects are things where the person was able to be brought into another project like Noah's and Mike's work, bringing them into synchronous and asynchronous resources that are already happening, provided them with at least a first step for continuing on their journey.
846810	850918	64	A	0.9976	Others are they're in different areas.
850934	873120	65	A	0.51	And so how to keep it open when people have ideas ranging from educational improvements to robotic deployments, what kind of feedback they need, and then how to balance the excitement around applying active inference with what it means to learn.
875810	878046	66	A	0.8773	Like, there are biochemistry classes.
878158	885570	67	A	0.98421	It's not all just biochemistry lab, but who's to say that's even the best way or anything like that?
885640	890710	68	A	0.71098	It's just we want to make sure that we keep it all in mind.
890780	901514	69	C	0.95391	Jessica yeah, and I think this suggestion is not connected to someone's project or Net 16 project.
901632	903814	70	C	0.85714	It's more like an exercise.
903862	911900	71	C	0.99939	So there's like a short exercise that it's going to be testing variational inference or something like that.
912990	920822	72	C	0.71	And then every participant in the class actually does the exercise.
920966	931310	73	C	1.0	And then it's assigned to other people in the cohort to analyze that person's submission.
931470	937922	74	C	0.50663	So it's like three people in the course analyze Jessica's submission and give feedback.
937986	954330	75	C	0.72	And it's going to be like for everybody will be getting three feedback on how they applied the terms, or there are other ways that they could be done, et cetera.
955950	964014	76	C	0.76713	If some of the things are like math related I will have to see because then the answer is going to be more clear.
964052	980130	77	C	0.80623	It's not going to be as objective but it's more like there's a short exercise, everybody does the exercise and then some people then get to review that answer of the person and give feedback on that.
980200	983060	78	C	0.59157	So it's like separate from an actual project.
984710	985794	79	A	0.88	Okay, makes sense.
985832	1010746	80	A	0.9965	It's kind of like a combination of having good example questions with an organizational structure and then like you said, balancing like where there might be a clearer measuring stick like was this the right equation or the right calculation or not?
1010928	1019360	81	A	0.92854	Versus how did this usage of affordances in a new context make sense to you?
1020610	1029434	82	A	0.79	And also it's not just about getting feedback on the person's idea.
1029472	1037500	83	A	0.99928	It's like the practice of providing constructive, ideally written comments is super important.
1038210	1064360	84	A	0.40779	Like the secret side of the questions is the discourse where the kinds of things that questions and ideas that send people on thought excursions and research rabbit holes, we can collaborate on that response together and it doesn't have to be the end all, be all.
1066890	1081450	85	A	0.90263	But sometimes by putting like a seed into the workspace, by putting like a prompt or a question, ten people could write for 5 minutes and then there would be 50 minutes of writing on that topic from different perspectives.
1083790	1104690	86	A	0.83222	Whereas if there's ten people also there could be 5 minutes of discussion which might add more seeds onto the table and it might continue to invoke whimsy or it might continue to instruct if there was a broad uncertainty that that 5 minutes of discourse resolved.
1107350	1131078	87	C	0.89	Yeah, I was going to say I think for the questions it's like somebody has a question that they're trying to understand and everybody's giving the crowdsource answer and helping sense make the meaning of how things are with the other exercise.
1131174	1140080	88	C	0.98	I think similar to I think what Blue wants to do with the short exercises to test whether people know the concept or not.
1141410	1155874	89	C	0.93242	It's just like adding by having people critique other people's work and having to critically think through the answer is another level of learning because it's not just like oh, I think this is the answer to this.
1155912	1177000	90	C	0.95423	It's like, no, I really have to understand one, the concept that I'm using to evaluate an answer and then also evaluate that person's answer and kind of compare and contrast and having to make that exercise of critical thinking.
1177630	1191230	91	C	0.65	I think helps people learn in a more in depth way because you have to think through your own thinking process and what things mean, what somebody else was saying, et cetera.
1193250	1196058	92	C	0.73	And I've seen it apply to writing.
1196154	1207940	93	C	0.77	I mean, I guess it's maybe easier to writing courses and things like that, but yeah, it's like another way of processing through the information.
1209430	1222630	94	C	1.0	And then also it also maybe reduces the burden on maybe, like, a person having to go through everybody's answer and making sure I'm the teacher, correcting everybody's answers.
1223370	1236330	95	C	0.94233	You're sharing the responsibility around everybody in the group of answering, evaluating people's responses to an exercise.
1238510	1239506	96	A	0.99997	Thank you, Brock.
1239558	1241360	97	A	1.0	And then anyone else with the right hand.
1246690	1249066	98	D	0.99911	Just to agree with Jessica.
1249098	1272326	99	D	0.96	And the last part, I was going to add that, but yeah, just systematically creating a systematic affordance for people to review or provide some validation that it's correct or on the right path or whatever will reduce the burden there.
1272428	1285050	100	D	1.0	And teaching is probably the best way to learn it's.
1287630	1293870	101	D	0.50218	Learning how to learn is like difficult to do without teaching.
1295490	1303380	102	D	0.69808	Like learning self learning is about teaching yourself to get better at teaching, you get better at teaching yourself.
1304310	1305060	103	D	0.65296	Thanks.
1314250	1316214	104	D	0.98956	Just the circle back.
1316252	1326520	105	D	0.88981	That does kind of require some meta structure to create examples or source them or whatever and then provide them.
1329550	1347600	106	D	0.85714	So I'm not sure outside of the project that I put on there and maybe it's kind of related to Yakubs as well, but outside of those two things, I'm not sure we have a clear affordance to do that yet.
1349570	1353054	107	A	0.65458	For coming up with examples of yeah.
1353092	1354818	108	D	0.79944	Like examples to work or whatever?
1354904	1364580	109	D	0.74	Yeah, either sourcing them and then putting them in a structure that says, oh, this is for section chapter one or whatever 1.1 or whatever.
1365350	1371494	110	A	0.95587	So not questions that are related to specific parts of the textbook with people to work through, but what kind of.
1371532	1376006	111	D	0.99998	Table or structure could be, I guess virtually the same.
1376108	1388540	112	D	0.99999	But instead of a question somebody is asking, it's an example for other people to answer, maybe with an answer that they can see, like if they want to reveal it or whatever.
1389310	1390794	113	D	0.9883	Does that make sense?
1390992	1396910	114	A	0.99814	Yes, it could be an example to work through in this course.
1396980	1409410	115	A	0.99996	It doesn't be in this exact table, but just make sure that we have written it down and everyone can be contributing to write it down and what the structure is because it's not like this is an impossible affordance.
1410230	1413906	116	A	0.99996	We can spin up the table right now and template it and just start to design it.
1413928	1420374	117	A	1.0	And over the coming weeks we have time to digest all these different inputs to make it.
1420412	1426760	118	A	0.99998	So in a few weeks it will fly by, but we might be able to be implementing these things.
1431150	1444702	119	A	0.87	I wanted to ask, what practices did people feel like they engaged in fruitfully, whether it's on here or not.
1444836	1450900	120	A	0.94045	Just when you you felt like were participating in the active textbook group, what did you feel like you were doing and how did it help?
1451270	1452590	121	B	0.99962	Equation translation?
1452670	1458854	122	B	0.64124	That was like the most helpful thing that I did and I don't think it's there.
1459052	1460822	123	B	0.99538	Well, I guess it's kind of there.
1460956	1471980	124	B	0.99997	It was like to copy the equations down, but putting them into natural language was probably like the thing that I did that was maybe most useful for myself and others.
1477070	1480810	125	A	0.36194	Yep, it was a great practice.
1481150	1491054	126	A	0.66	And it it leads to and scaffolds so many other why is it this way?
1491092	1491694	127	A	0.99999	What does this mean?
1491732	1492606	128	A	0.99999	What are the examples?
1492638	1495378	129	A	0.83291	It's not like the prerequisite per se.
1495544	1499170	130	A	0.98758	It's possible to ask questions without having the natural language description.
1500070	1512946	131	A	0.76414	But whether it's a basic or a multiline equation, it helps bring consilience to that discussion.
1513138	1518922	132	A	1.0	Because there's a non zero probability that then a term is going to be used loosely or it's going to be used one way.
1518976	1541280	133	A	1.0	Then it's going to be conversationally used slightly differently, or people will not agree on which ontology terms are invoked or not, which can then have every equation start to spiral off into every possible ontology term, and they very well might actually connect that way.
1541590	1555750	134	A	0.64988	But being able to see what is variational free energy, and if there's some term that is being connected to variational free energy that's not being described in the equation, that's fine.
1555900	1562840	135	A	0.99638	Like least squared error isn't in the linear regression y equals MX plus b.
1563290	1572090	136	A	0.99999	So there can be formal and informal concepts that are super important for understanding that aren't with a symbol.
1572830	1579760	137	A	0.50713	But this was a great way to be clear what the symbols actually are.
1592390	1601210	138	A	0.9466	What other practices did people feel like they benefited from?
1603580	1608810	139	A	0.99993	What would they recommend for a daily schedule for somebody who wanted to learn a lot.
1637740	1638650	140	D	0.98	I think.
1639420	1665250	141	D	0.92254	Plus one there on blues, like writing the equations, which is like maybe a super simple but open ended, almost kind of version of Jessica's suggestion, but also in general, just adding stuff to the coda, asking questions.
1666900	1676132	142	D	0.95636	Like if you read and you don't ask a question, did you really grapple with it at all?
1676186	1677030	143	D	1.0	I don't know.
1682280	1685312	144	A	0.9901	How do we improve thinking by writing?
1685376	1707310	145	A	0.68	And the actual number of typed words that people add in as a proxy during a discussion is one thing, but even just afterwards, or on their own time frame, how can we have ten people who do read a chapter just scaling numbers?
1708320	1723008	146	A	0.99998	Each of them could think of several questions ranging from simple I wasn't sure about to simple again, like more like an example one like what are the three kinds of this?
1723174	1727380	147	A	1.0	And it's totally known and their answer is fully listed to research your questions.
1727450	1736710	148	A	0.99998	But how could we have many more inputs in terms of the questions that people are asking?
1737260	1745796	149	A	1.0	Do people feel like they wrote questions in their own notes but didn't bring it into shared workspace?
1745828	1752540	150	A	1.0	Or do people feel like for themselves or others that they observed that the questions weren't actually phrased?
1755560	1757430	151	A	0.86864	Jessica then anyone else?
1760120	1764740	152	C	0.95	I was going to share more about the student practices.
1765240	1791970	153	C	0.99993	But I guess first of all, the last question you mentioned there were things that I didn't put in the general textbook thing, which were more about parsing information, which was like helping me connect the dots and synthesize information, which Ali actually helped me a lot also with some of that.
1792420	1802740	154	C	0.72026	But those things were sort of like personal for me to try to make sense of the material in terms of the student practices.
1807400	1820730	155	C	0.99967	Initially I was thinking to do every day like an hour each for the reading and maybe like an hour for the math to kind of get foundational things.
1822300	1834270	156	C	0.99991	But then I found it was better for me to maybe dedicate, like, a longer period of time on one day or two days for the reading, as opposed to, like, a little bit of the reading or chunk more.
1834800	1841904	157	C	1.0	Two, 3 hours in one day and then maybe follow up another day with a longer period of reading as well.
1841942	1843804	158	C	1.0	Instead of daily reading.
1843852	1844850	159	C	1.0	A little bit.
1847140	1864090	160	C	0.99	And I think that's more because I guess for memory I mean, they do say to do like repetition for memory but I think for me it's like well read longer and have the material fresh in your mind as reading as opposed to going every day.
1865340	1875092	161	C	0.94	And then for the math, because I guess there's less of keeping the material press in your mind daily.
1875156	1876536	162	C	0.64	I was trying to do that.
1876638	1880312	163	C	0.67469	So then it fell off a little bit on that part.
1880446	1887660	164	C	0.55697	But yeah, at least it wasn't every day but four days a week, at least like an hour or so trying to focus on the math.
1888260	1898370	165	C	0.99917	But yeah, that's kind of how my practice got developed over time through the course.
1948660	1967130	166	A	0.99805	So the textbook is for as the research people who want to apply in their research, if we remember from the introduction, provide readers with the ability to understand and use active inference in their own research.
1971430	1978850	167	A	0.79031	We'll have a better sense after part two with a more applied slide.
1984330	1991320	168	A	0.99962	Who might the next cohort of the textbook group be in and communicate to?
1994010	2029180	169	A	0.9992	Yes, over many iterations and, you know, can go many ways, but when people are thinking like in the next few weeks who blue wrote, okay, can we review which questions and understand because I don't quite understand how.
2032990	2036038	170	B	0.99076	If you want to check out the questions, check out chapter two.
2036144	2041390	171	B	0.99	And a lot of the questions were so if you scroll down, keep scrolling, keep scrolling.
2042450	2046906	172	B	0.44906	I'm trying to think about which ones that were skipped.
2046938	2047760	173	B	0.99974	Let's see.
2048770	2054802	174	A	0.86	And also there's no skipping there's what we can address in the 1 hour or 2 hours, right.
2054936	2058260	175	A	0.52626	So we can raise our attention to all the important questions.
2058790	2065378	176	B	0.59	Yeah, it was just like and then I realized most of my questions were of a largely technical nature.
2065554	2069734	177	B	0.9994	So let me scroll through the coda and see if I can find them.
2069772	2075820	178	B	0.99997	But it was like in chapter two, it was like let's see.
2078830	2088250	179	A	0.88	The general thing to me is how can we, among other things, prevent question, self censorship and filtering?
2090190	2092494	180	A	0.45245	We know that question isn't just like this one.
2092612	2094202	181	A	0.99796	Genius meets genius.
2094346	2109780	182	A	0.56516	Perfectly framed specific answer that will be understood in one sentence but that question is like a broader space of prompts that don't necessarily have any prior on whether it has to do with an application or it could be a technical question.
2112470	2113330	183	A	0.8	Yeah, good.
2113480	2114242	184	B	0.99987	It was early.
2114296	2117862	185	B	0.99998	It was like in chapter two and chapter three and there were a lot of questions.
2117996	2119606	186	B	0.66035	I'm trying to look at the specific.
2119708	2123160	187	B	0.99994	I'll have to look at my own coda instead of watching you beautiful people.
2126490	2129518	188	B	0.89415	It just happened early in those meetings.
2129714	2132714	189	B	0.83	And it's not that there wasn't time like that.
2132752	2134442	190	B	1.0	We didn't address the questions in order.
2134496	2137398	191	B	0.99992	It was like let's skip this because it's technical, let's skip this because it's technical.
2137494	2138902	192	B	0.99858	Let's skip this because it's technical.
2138966	2142430	193	B	0.99999	So I just stopped putting my questions in because I feel like they're technical.
2142930	2145438	194	B	1.0	What does this little squiggly symbol mean?
2145524	2157198	195	B	0.6	And that's why for me the translation of equations into natural language was the most useful thing because I feel like all of my questions are technical, like related to the math.
2157374	2161310	196	B	0.99762	So I stopped entering them into the coda because they were just skipped over.
2161480	2162278	197	A	1.0	Okay, thanks.
2162364	2164680	198	A	0.99937	Well, yeah, I appreciate it.
2165530	2204820	199	A	0.99981	Again, I personally hope that we can have structures that uncouple the perceived importance of real time speech from the contributions that people make so that we can be really clear about which questions we're going to be addressing in conversation and use conversation for what it can bring many things and then have 200 questions in chapter two with many upvoters or with whatever mechanism that brings different questions to the fore.
2206950	2210446	200	A	0.99976	So there isn't even like the plausibility of being skipped.
2210478	2234300	201	A	0.96246	It's just a question of like what will we raise up and focus on individually and as a group from the many, many questions of different kinds that support a beginner with fundamentals and a pre beginner with background and somebody who's asking research questions as well.
2244030	2257920	202	D	0.97888	So I think one simple thing is if you go back to the questions table like you have an interest column here.
2261010	2261854	203	D	0.99991	Interesting.
2262052	2280770	204	D	0.9984	Yes, even better, maybe there is what we will address in the next coming live stream or session kind of table that is taken from the questions table.
2282330	2295900	205	D	0.99486	But the questions table has no such projection of what is interesting or not, especially in some one dimensional kind of like yes or no thing.
2298110	2334840	206	D	0.87747	It's just a separation of random things, prompts questions and then there is some process to get it to what will be addressed in the live stream that again, there's ways to try to do things like randomization or trying to like ensure that, you know, we don't continuously ask focus from one person and or things like that.
2335210	2338120	207	D	0.99	The popularity doesn't kind of win the day.
2341130	2355418	208	D	0.9786	There's more complex ways to do this that are kind of almost like decision making processes like ephemeral group processes and things like that.
2355504	2361674	209	D	0.86547	But yeah, I think just separating them it would be helpful.
2361722	2371566	210	D	0.5695	There at least another thing might be like zoom, you could do breakout rooms.
2371678	2373518	211	D	0.99996	Maybe that's not the format.
2373694	2379934	212	D	0.99994	But again, just that's kind of an Ephemeral group processing.
2379982	2385320	213	D	0.62675	Like perhaps everyone doesn't want to focus on the same questions.
2386170	2395530	214	D	0.99997	Should there be a temporary split of verging of attention for some short period of time and then recombine?
2396430	2405610	215	D	0.99901	Don't know what that means for a live stream or recording precisely but that's possible solution.
2407410	2408640	216	A	0.94	Yeah, thanks.
2409730	2415934	217	A	0.97809	Gather is awesome for these things but it does require clarity around how it's going to be done.
2416132	2430770	218	A	0.99963	Like mass one on one breakouts, mass smaller breakouts and rearranging people using their spatial location to express different things and assemble into different Ephemeral teams.
2445310	2451210	219	A	0.98	Okay, let's look at some project ideas.
2452270	2457120	220	A	0.98	Okay, so for those who are here or not, I hope I'm not misrepresenting anything.
2458690	2467230	221	A	0.6002	Mike brought up some token economies that's something that we've been actively going towards in Active Blockprints.
2473570	2495410	222	A	0.99705	So I'll just add just a note column in Active Block, for instance, as well as as mentioned earlier, working with Noah on some more some related topics.
2496870	2497620	223	A	1.0	Okay.
2498870	2503490	224	A	0.9942	Audiobook recording of a textbook just as we go through these projects.
2504390	2510550	225	A	0.99946	I've recorded the first chapter and the preface type materials.
2512570	2520090	226	A	1.0	Do people think that an audio recording has utility?
2524570	2543322	227	A	0.99	And if so, is anyone interested to pursue this avenue with blue and eye because it's very defined and it involves primarily the equations, having natural descriptions and then just reading and it can go many other directions too.
2543376	2560750	228	A	0.87247	But this is like kind of a clear accessibility affordance for different participants that might be interesting as well as just get out there on YouTube and other channels as having that artifact blue.
2561170	2569520	229	B	1.0	I do think it's useful obviously, if I've elected to I didn't realize I signed up to be the participant lead but I'm so happy to do it.
2570730	2571480	230	C	0.59452	Is.
2574730	2581240	231	B	0.99592	But I do think it's useful as someone who drives a considerable amount of time every day.
2582410	2588582	232	B	0.63652	If it's not like I'm not a very good auditory learner, but it does help to reinforce the concepts.
2588726	2600974	233	B	1.0	And I just wanted to mention even if you're not comfortable perhaps doing the math or reading the textbook, Daniel thinks he can read it until it's perfect.
2601172	2613006	234	B	1.0	I would prefer to do some video or audio editing so that's also an option is to do audio editing occasionally.
2613198	2622886	235	B	0.68859	Daniel does it very infrequently but I think there's the occasional tripping over a word or saying a word twice like when you lose your place or something like that.
2622988	2626866	236	B	0.98752	So video or audio editing, I do it with Windows video editor.
2626898	2638694	237	B	1.0	But audio editing is also another possible affordance there and it would involve reading along with the textbook to make sure that it's accurate that no sentences are skipped and then to just splice out any mishaps.
2638742	2646620	238	B	1.0	Or just ask him to rerecord the Markov blanket for precision just so you can splice it over the trip up if needed.
2647550	2648318	239	A	1.0	Yeah, thanks.
2648404	2650640	240	A	0.99993	Definitely we would do a multi part.
2651650	2653466	241	A	1.0	I just did one pass on the first chapter?
2653498	2654682	242	A	1.0	No equations, et cetera.
2654746	2656014	243	A	0.8964	Draft, but okay.
2656132	2663858	244	A	0.77824	Anyways, just so people who are interested here or rewatching can know about this.
2663944	2664578	245	A	0.99	Okay.
2664744	2670654	246	A	0.9697	Resources for conducting research or developing active inference agents, ways to facilitate the starting of that work for participants.
2670702	2672120	247	A	0.99999	Just a seed idea.
2673690	2685180	248	A	0.57	A lot of this is going to be explored in part two because it's a recipe for designing the models, and we'll have a lot of infrastructure around that as well.
2686590	2702960	249	A	0.99935	So I hope whoever wrote this continues in that interest and builds that starting point for conducting research or developing agents based around what they learn and see in part two.
2703490	2704240	250	A	0.99	Okay.
2710010	2710760	251	A	0.68	Okay.
2712570	2721900	252	A	0.99341	Also, typing just directly in the code is a little better than comments, because sometimes it's hard to understand what the comments are like referring to.
2723730	2724142	253	A	0.99	Okay.
2724196	2730590	254	A	0.99956	Complete mathematical overview of active inference, derivations of key results, maps of equations.
2731570	2732320	255	A	0.91269	Yes.
2733090	2733950	256	A	0.8	All awesome.
2734020	2736340	257	A	0.90249	Thank you, Jakub, for suggesting this.
2738230	2757910	258	A	0.63	I think the closest related works are in the active phontology and in knowledge engineering and other areas too, and I hope that we're on this path.
2759210	2762460	259	A	0.75683	So however Jacob or anyone else wants to connect on that.
2762830	2763674	260	A	0.98	Okay.
2763872	2765210	261	A	0.87179	Active foundations.
2766190	2784360	262	A	0.68898	So here we added this page if Brock or anyone else wants to add any comments or describe how some of these comments can be integrated with textbook group.
2791780	2795088	263	D	0.81387	Um, short answers.
2795104	2815272	264	D	0.57935	I'm not entirely sure the precise way to integrate it with the textbook group, but there are just perhaps this is related to questions, making questions, removing the stigma or whatever.
2815406	2833072	265	D	0.55584	Like, it's just helpful, I think, to have some affordance or regime of attention or whatever thing that says, hey, if you don't understand this thing about active inference, that's a foundational thing.
2833206	2846070	266	D	0.97206	Like, okay, I get entropy and I get energy, like the basic concepts of them, but when you're subtracting them, what the hell are we talking about?
2847400	2858280	267	D	1.0	And then maybe there's some follow on questions about mathematically what entropy is mathematically, what is energy?
2858350	2861044	268	D	0.62	Or what is Shannon entropy specifically?
2861092	2862250	269	D	0.99998	What is the difference?
2862620	2864090	270	D	0.77357	These sorts of things.
2868640	2879970	271	D	0.67	A, it's that an, affordance for that, but B, it's also just acknowledging, like, there's a wealth of knowledge already here.
2880660	2902180	272	D	0.99966	It's not a complete mystery what those background foundational things are or what learners might want to get out of some relatively short course to get up to speed and feel real confident reading the textbook.
2903580	2929970	273	D	0.9	And so there's a kind of top down affordance there too, I think, that needs to be made for people that can say, hey, there's a bunch of equations over or examples over here that are these are the most helpful ones I found for understanding what Bayesian inference really is, how that really works.
2932100	2936224	274	D	0.7749	So I guess it would be those two things.
2936342	2954630	275	D	0.99995	But if you look into the project notes there on that project idea thing, there's a little more detail of just a couple of bullet points there of just.
2955740	2961544	276	D	0.98331	It's really hard for people, I think, to get into a new thing if there's not a model.
2961742	2965572	277	D	0.99999	If you do chemistry without Bohr's model, good luck.
2965716	2984992	278	D	0.99927	If you have to jump, especially to something like electron probability clouds or something, it's just like why would you do that when you have a perfectly good periodic table and simple discrete and it's enough even to do basic physics like Newtonian stuff.
2985046	2985650	279	D	0.99909	Right.
2987460	2988690	280	D	0.95	You need a model.
2989140	2992784	281	D	1.0	I think a lot of people history is helpful.
2992832	2996516	282	D	0.99997	There very minimal amount, but just this is where this came from.
2996538	2997780	283	D	0.99981	This is why it's relevant.
2998920	3007000	284	D	0.77101	It's really hard for people, I think, to blindly calculate without that sort of simple context.
3008860	3027070	285	D	0.84821	So I just kind of made a very rudimentary still kind of scaffolding it, coda it's already linked in that project row, but I'll put it in that sub page there too.
3027760	3030000	286	D	0.99978	Super work in progress.
3034420	3040000	287	D	0.97	The idea is just these questions are going to be asked over and over and over again.
3040150	3047472	288	D	0.99999	There will be people coming from a more mathematical, more physics, more neuroscience from different backgrounds.
3047616	3054472	289	D	0.87	And so why pretend like that's not happening or reinvent the wheel every time somebody asks a question?
3054526	3075500	290	D	0.99059	Like just having a central resource where people can get a lot of value, but also maybe ask a question that's a little more they might not want to ask and seem like it's too simple or it's too whatever in the live stream.
3078580	3080130	291	A	1.0	Okay, thank you.
3082980	3084976	292	A	0.99995	Any other comments or thoughts on this?
3084998	3087410	293	A	0.99979	Otherwise we'll just continue on for the final minutes.
3089460	3090210	294	A	0.85	Okay.
3091880	3093380	295	A	0.99838	Textbook enrichment.
3093960	3094372	296	A	0.99974	Yes.
3094426	3106280	297	A	1.0	I hope everyone continues to annotate, figure out also things on their own and explore and like we're building something really powerful with annotation.
3106940	3116510	298	A	0.61417	So I hope that people can continue to be enriching with the structures that we're building.
3118000	3129756	299	A	0.99991	But yes, so much of what this group has been about has been about textbook enrichment and improvement robot modeling.
3129788	3137090	300	A	0.98933	Unless anyone has other comments, I think learning from JF and staying in part two will help.
3138100	3141910	301	A	0.89	And yeah, Jessica and then anyone else?
3146030	3147626	302	C	0.99124	Sorry, I think I didn't raise my.
3147648	3148860	303	A	0.99631	Hand from no worries.
3152590	3153194	304	A	0.99992	Yes.
3153312	3158400	305	A	0.9999	Well, any general comments that people want to provide on the textbook group?
3171850	3180780	306	D	1.0	I think the live streams are super important for the lab and the whole space for maybe obvious reason.
3181230	3184700	307	D	1.0	The textbook group is equally important.
3186190	3192910	308	D	0.9467	These are like the two most important things that can add value to the space and the lab participants.
