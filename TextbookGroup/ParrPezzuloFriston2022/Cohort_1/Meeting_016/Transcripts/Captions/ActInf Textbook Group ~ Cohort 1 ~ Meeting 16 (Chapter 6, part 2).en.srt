1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,860
okay hello it's September 16th

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,600
we're in

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,080
cohort one of the active textbook group

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,540
it's uh meeting 15.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,780
or I guess uh yes no 16.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,619
on um let me just update the title

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,359
meaning 16 we're in our second

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,300
discussion on chapter six so

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,340
are there any

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,140
overall comments that people would like

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,400
to

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,260
address about chapter six

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,780
or any other questions or points to add

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,120
or just areas of chapter six that they

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,140
found to be interesting

16
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
distinction between the interceptive X

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,460
receptive uh

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,080
modalities

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,960
which have been mentioned in box 6.1

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,000
and

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,140
first I think Kristen with my Michael

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,080
Allen if I'm not mistaken uh has

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,740
published a recent paper just today uh

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,340
exactly on that topic in which they've

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,320
somehow tried to provide a computational

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,479
model for the first time for the

27
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,759
unification of the intercepted the next

28
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,500
receptive modalities so since this

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,920
chapter is also that

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,700
the modeling of those agents I think

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,280
this paper from

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,960
in the body's eye the computational

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
anatomy of interceptive inference might

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,419
be relevant for anyone who wants to

35
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,080
model these modalities

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,340
for the aid of active inference

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,860
framework

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,500
thank you very nice thanks for sharing

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,300
it um

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,000
let's look at box six one

41
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,099
as people see it what distinguishes

42
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,360
exteroceptive proprioceptive and

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,739
interoceptive modalities

44
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,500
for example why are proprioceptive and

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,120
interceptive separated

46
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,159
and because

47
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,800
uh I couldn't hear you I don't know if

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,140
it's on my side or oh connection was

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,959
unstable from your side sorry

50
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,819
let me try something I'll be gone for a

51
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,879
second

52
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,879
am I back

53
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,459
okay so yeah what uh yeah Brock I do

54
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,500
need the starlink

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,739
why are proprioception and terraception

56
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,080
separated

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,620
and why are these three categories

58
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,540
modeled as different why have they been

59
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,140
framed as different

60
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,100
biological and neurological mechanisms

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,180
and neural mechanisms that

62
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,000
somehow can

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,259
control those

64
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,860
different kind of perceptions because uh

65
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,479
for the extraceptive perception

66
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,180
the organism would necessarily meet

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,340
would necessarily need a kind of

68
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,280
sensory

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,699
I mean the sensation it gets from the

70
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,940
environment is just

71
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,360
um on the level of its uh

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,500
of the imminent stimuli that it gets

73
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,979
from the external environment but for

74
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,539
the interceptive uh modality uh the

75
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,960
sensation is just the internal uh

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,860
Sensations and so on and for the

77
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,860
proprioceptive it's related to motor

78
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,539
control uh feedback loop so I guess

79
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,979
because of their different

80
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,660
mechanisms it

81
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,820
might be helpful to talk in different

82
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,759
terms about each of them but I'm not

83
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,080
totally sure about that

84
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,259
I agree I think one aspect even in a

85
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,020
pre-blanket or non-blanket modality is

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,820
like they're about external things

87
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,280
versus about internal things and then

88
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,800
between proprioception and interception

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,780
you're absolutely right that

90
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,720
they have different neural mechanisms

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,639
and physiological mechanisms

92
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,880
um

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,199
with some blurry space perhaps for

94
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
example like interception about blood

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,259
pressure

96
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,539
is somewhere in between like a muscular

97
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,860
reflex and uh in organ reflex but the

98
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,860
tissues being addressed are different

99
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,800
let's look at this paper

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,900
again we'll we'll return to the book but

101
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
we're going to be thinking today and

102
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
then especially going forward with like

103
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,819
how do you

104
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,360
identify

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,100
the

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,539
um

107
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,000
let's go to this question which we we

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,280
just just to look at it

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,400
which system are we modeling

110
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,020
what is the appropriate form for the

111
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,400
generative model

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,620
how do we set up a generative model

113
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,080
how do we set up a generative process

114
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
so let's see if we can determine some of

115
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,699
those aspects

116
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,319
in this paper

117
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,780
#figure four three

118
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,979
it is the very same

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
okay this is just a general pointing to

120
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,319
a partially observable Markov decision

121
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,460
process

122
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,259
with a slight

123
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,380
um plus computational biology graphical

124
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,020
veneer to match the color scheme

125
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,180
probably not but but it kind of looks

126
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,479
like it

127
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,819
here

128
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,319
is where we see this schematic

129
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,560
of the form of the generative model

130
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,099
variables are used

131
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,380
to reflect that those variables can be

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,139
fit from empirical data or just a priori

133
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,780
set and simulate it but this is the form

134
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,400
of the model

135
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,740
these are the shapes of the matrices and

136
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,180
tensors

137
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,680
that

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,479
go from

139
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,660
that are going to address

140
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,580
what their model is about

141
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,500
um does anybody want to like

142
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,839
describe what they see in this

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,799
what do you think they were trying to

144
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,039
explain

145
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,540
and what do you think they were trying

146
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,120
to model what is their system of

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Interest based upon what you see here

148
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,459
uh actually one interesting term that

149
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,440
came up with

150
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,360
I mean used in this paper is uh

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,000
cardiac active inference the term that

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,279
they've been they've used in this paper

153
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,540
to describe uh the kind of

154
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,580
interrelationship between the heart

155
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,019
rhythm and uh the I mean the

156
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,279
interception so this generative model uh

157
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
I believe is uh just about

158
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
modeling that relationship between the

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,700
heart rhythm and the interception so

160
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,940
uh we can see as usual the B matrices c

161
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,760
and a matrices that we've seen before

162
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,240
and but in this case uh they've applied

163
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,399
uh to the

164
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,480
uh variation in the heart rhythm and how

165
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,080
it relates to the interception and so

166
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,399
yes

167
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,959
so

168
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,560
again using the variables that we know

169
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
from figure four three in the book and

170
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
their figure one here

171
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,480
the hidden states that are not directly

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
observed

173
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,300
are on the interceptive side relating to

174
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,459
the state of the heart

175
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,459
on the exteriorceptive side whether

176
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,979
there is a flower or a spider

177
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,120
the outcomes that are observed are the

178
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
visual exteroception of a flower or a

179
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,140
spider

180
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,360
and the heart rate

181
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,940
probably a low and a high heart rate

182
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,459
the piece that links these two

183
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,240
is the sensory attenuation

184
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,959
between the high heart rate states

185
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,660
and the mapping of exteroception

186
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,360
in the B Matrix you can just see that

187
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,300
even the the allocation of the symbols

188
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,399
is different

189
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,880
like when you're aroused

190
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,700
when you're in this this is like heart

191
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,519
open and then heart contract

192
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,100
so when you're in the aroused

193
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,860
situation B is how the hidden States

194
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
change their time

195
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,720
you're always going to go from here

196
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,260
to here

197
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,620
whereas in the relaxed situation

198
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,720
sometimes you go to the from this state

199
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,980
to this one

200
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,839
other times you're relaxed and so you

201
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,959
actually you dwell within that state

202
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,920
so here it's like pump rest pump rest

203
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,540
pump rest

204
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,920
here

205
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,740
it's 50 slower just it depends on the

206
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,320
parameters but it's 50 slower because

207
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,360
sometimes

208
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,760
you're going to go from one but it looks

209
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,380
like as it's here that it's actually

210
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,320
like or it's twice as slow

211
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,220
rest rest beat rest rest beat

212
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,740
so these are the two interceptive states

213
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,140
one has a preference

214
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,800
for having relaxed Hearts when flowers

215
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
are around

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,940
and having contracted heart when spiders

217
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,240
are around

218
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,820
the a matrix maps on these two sensory

219
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,440
modalities

220
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,000
between

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
hidden States and outcome States

222
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,360
just like any a matrix would do in any

223
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,459
pumdp

224
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,019
and then there's also a transition

225
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,700
Matrix

226
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,240
of the generative process

227
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,279
so it's a very simple generative process

228
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,459
where either flowers or flowers

229
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,779
or spiders or spiders

230
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,060
as they would say you can use standard

231
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,200
routines

232
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,180
to simulate these techniques I hope that

233
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,940
that the code are available

234
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,160
you can plot

235
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,440
parameter sweeps

236
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,500
as you explore the beta and the alpha

237
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,680
yeah so here's like the beta parameter

238
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,260
and Alpha parameter

239
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,660
so you can do parameter sweeps with this

240
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,779
grid search or other approaches

241
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,839
and then do statistics on those outputs

242
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,720
is this quote active inference well it's

243
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,240
the output of a parameter sweep on an

244
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
active inference model

245
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
there's various other kinds of methods

246
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,200
so not to spend too too much time on the

247
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,579
paper but

248
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,079
um

249
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,820
does anyone have any thoughts on like

250
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,320
that

251
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,839
case

252
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,720
or how they see it applying to chapter

253
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,620
six's content

254
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
I think it speaks to a um

255
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,860
fulfillment cycle in active inference

256
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,279
research

257
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,220
oh

258
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,440
this work example helps a lot

259
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,480
I mean if anyone wants to uh

260
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,779
especially because uh describing this

261
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,519
kind of cardiac active inference as

262
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,980
a kind of

263
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,980
system that has a definite Mark of

264
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,820
blanket uh it was a really interesting

265
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,880
question at the first place and uh I

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,440
think they've done

267
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,839
uh really

268
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,360
um great job obviously in that regard

269
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,199
and thinking really creatively and out

270
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,240
of the box

271
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,480
uh about how we can describe that whole

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,899
system uh with Native

273
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,740
using markup blankets to describe its

274
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,839
internal and external environment and so

275
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,019
on

276
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
it also

277
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,279
um relates to this earlier question

278
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,260
so how does the figure four three

279
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,160
paradigm

280
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,139
discrete and continuous State spaces

281
00:15:58,139 --> 00:15:59,699
with all the

282
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,220
attending complexities do you hear me

283
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,519
Ellie

284
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,199
okay yeah

285
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,880
okay okay how does this representation

286
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,339
connect to

287
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,100
um can you hear Daniel because yeah

288
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,339
it's a story for another day some of the

289
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,899
incredible

290
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,480
the truly incredible internet

291
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm gonna try one thing so I think that

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,779
or Holly

293
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,540
I'll try something

294
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,720
foreign

295
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,319
here's what's interesting with the Wi-Fi

296
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,179
and then we'll continue because it's not

297
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,880
it's not a Wi-Fi learning group but with

298
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,199
the hot spot

299
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,319
there are a set of people who I cannot

300
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,240
interact with

301
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
but with Wi-Fi I am able to interact

302
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,780
with those people

303
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,740
just a note

304
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,199
so

305
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,980
we see the pomdp representation

306
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,059
now

307
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,040
what is not in this paper

308
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,520
here is a graphical layout

309
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,960
of the pomdp

310
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,380
okay

311
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,179
what is not in this paper

312
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,100
a figure six one

313
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,140
or indeed a figure one one

314
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,140
representation

315
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,320
so why is that

316
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,120
uh I'm not sure I've understood your

317
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,280
question quite clearly but

318
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,080
uh could you please elaborate on that a

319
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,900
little bit yes yes sure so when we look

320
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,760
at papers like vassal at all

321
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,220
communication is active inference social

322
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,919
and active active inference loops loops

323
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,080
loops you know Falcon at all remote

324
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,900
teams loops loops loops

325
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,419
Markov blanket interface

326
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,820
Loops entities things

327
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,080
yet in the application

328
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,919
what is specified is not the loopy

329
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,480
situation

330
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,760
what needs to be specified is chapter

331
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
six

332
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,679
not chapter one

333
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,960
so I find that very interesting

334
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,020
because so much of the focus attention

335
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,980
discourse

336
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,200
has been around abstractions around

337
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,780
Markov blankets

338
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,700
and their interpretations from various

339
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,820
stances and about boundaries physical

340
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,100
boundaries and conceptual boundaries

341
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,879
but it's a non-controversy

342
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,780
when it's written this way

343
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,000
and there are Markov blankets between

344
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,799
many of these variables

345
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,780
because it's a Bayesian graph that's not

346
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,460
fully connected so every Bayesian graph

347
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,960
that's not fully connected has Markov

348
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,320
blankets trivially

349
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,120
but this paper doesn't

350
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,918
need to describe

351
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,900
what is this is enough to say what's

352
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,480
inside and outside the organismal Markov

353
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,100
blanket if you want to even think about

354
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,820
it is like here in this line kind of not

355
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,100
not on the base graph

356
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,720
but it's between

357
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,419
The Spider and the flower outside

358
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,700
and the vision of The Spider and the

359
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,260
flower

360
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,600
but that's like

361
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,179
taken care of

362
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,539
with the a matrix of the exteroceptive

363
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,080
modality

364
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,000
which is I think why this

365
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,539
recipe

366
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,160
does not

367
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,900
Focus

368
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,860
on which thing are we modeling

369
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,559
but rather which system are we modeling

370
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,179
and yes we're going to pursue the

371
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,740
generative model before the generative

372
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,960
process even though they may have

373
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,140
symmetry or they may be very similar

374
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,039
um

375
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,320
but I just find it very interesting open

376
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,879
to hearing what people think like why

377
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,179
the cybernetic Loop action perception

378
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,340
Loop

379
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,559
is used

380
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,760
so much

381
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,400
in contrast with the form

382
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,919
of the model that's actually implemented

383
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,539
which is a it's a different topology in

384
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,379
a different discussion

385
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
I know that they're integrated and

386
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,940
compatible

387
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,260
uh just one comment on that is you see

388
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,200
at least to my understanding uh markup

389
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,700
blanket is a kind of

390
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,179
uh the kind of think modeling tool or a

391
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,860
kind of uh a way of thinking about the

392
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,400
basically the ontology of I mean the

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,799
Anthology in the sense of philosophy

394
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,380
it's philosophical use the ontology of

395
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,120
the system that we're about to model so

396
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,559
uh it's not necessarily uh the

397
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,780
relationships among the different

398
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,539
components of the markup blanket is

399
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,500
there's something not necessarily

400
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,280
physical or tangible relationships in

401
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,960
that system so it might be uh kind of

402
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,980
just informational

403
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,880
as as we've just

404
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,100
we saw in I think chapter five if I'm

405
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,799
not mistaken uh the information passing

406
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,780
among the different components and so on

407
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,700
so uh at least I think the reason for

408
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,960
not using uh the schematic model of

409
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,380
markup I mean the cybernetic model of a

410
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,679
markup blanket instead of uh using just

411
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,679
the schematic form uh probably it's

412
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,140
because of this uh kind of uh non let's

413
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,039
say non-physical or non-tangible

414
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,120
relationship among the different

415
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,500
components by non-tangible and

416
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,440
non-physical I mean something that can't

417
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,720
be

418
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,580
explained in terms of its uh ontological

419
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,860
existence if

420
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,820
I don't know if I would I could

421
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,700
express myself in that regard or not but

422
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,740
thank you ali um Brock and anyone else

423
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,379
um I was just going to

424
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,860
I don't know um I I feel like personally

425
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,178
I'm just kind of at my

426
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,440
um the affordances that I have to

427
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,159
um

428
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,620
get pragmatic and epistemic value here

429
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,720
without like doing some modeling of some

430
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,340
kind

431
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,399
um

432
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,900
yeah I don't know that's just good

433
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,480
thanks I mean this is the the second

434
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,460
discussion on chapter six

435
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,900
and then

436
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,120
this is setting us up to actually pursue

437
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,820
a model so we should be providing these

438
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,520
things yes I'm just yeah I'm just saying

439
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,940
it it's definitely ripe for that

440
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,340
I I mean yes uh Rohan

441
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,580
uh yeah so uh actually just to get some

442
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,900
clarification

443
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,480
you're asking why

444
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,200
the form of the model is as mentioned in

445
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Japanese given in chapter six which is

446
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,260
chapter one

447
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,400
yes I mean they're they're compatible

448
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,340
topologies that actually are describing

449
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,960
an overlapping set of notes

450
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,980
I was just calling attention to the the

451
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,159
um amount of discourse and focus

452
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,100
on the potentially more familiar

453
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,200
more schematic

454
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,140
action perception Loop

455
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,240
and the way that that draws so much

456
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,460
attention to the organism environment

457
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,320
interface

458
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,960
whereas when it comes to the empirical

459
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,240
modeling

460
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,779
that interface never had to be specified

461
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,240
as like a first class

462
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,580
type

463
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,400
it just was included by the by

464
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,960
we just said there are spiders and

465
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,740
flowers out there hidden States s and

466
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,840
then there's observations of and and

467
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,459
there I there's no error

468
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,740
there's no errors

469
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,720
there would be no error in the

470
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,120
generative process itself the model

471
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,918
might have better right so

472
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,799
um so there would be the I mean that

473
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,140
comes from some measurement issue right

474
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,960
so so when you measure it and

475
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,919
you confuse say spider for flower or

476
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,380
flower for spider then you would get

477
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,720
some error and then maybe that's where I

478
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,400
guess you can talk about the Marco

479
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,720
blanket

480
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,900
uh with specifying or misobserving

481
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,580
something

482
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,220
so I I'm not sure

483
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,600
what what exactly is thinking yeah

484
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,380
I mean they're compatible right so

485
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,480
in this case there's no error but if

486
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,700
there was error obviously there would be

487
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,960
something wrong

488
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
empty

489
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,539
let me actually just correct this I

490
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,900
believe be I mean I I didn't mean to say

491
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,880
this is the visual error this is saying

492
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
that they're unchanging the flowers so

493
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,480
it's either they're either one or the

494
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,419
other here parametrically it's possible

495
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,340
to introduce visual error in the a

496
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,720
matrix

497
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,679
but I'm I'm just pointing to the the

498
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,059
architecture of the model

499
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:23,480
doesn't require even engaging with this

500
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,500
it's totally compatible

501
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,299
and the observations are the set States

502
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,679
and the actions are the active States

503
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,539
and so on

504
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,860
but

505
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,600
as presented

506
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,720
and as constructed

507
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,000
we if we're going to use a pomdp

508
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,380
architecture

509
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,600
we don't necessarily even need a

510
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,559
representation like this

511
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,260
yeah

512
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,679
Jessica

513
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,750
okay that's interesting

514
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,970
[Music]

515
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,900
hi yes I

516
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,500
for me the reason why

517
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,299
like it's like two part like the reason

518
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,080
why they they send um crap is so popular

519
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,700
and I think maybe it's also the reason

520
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,380
why it was

521
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,860
used and this is the Simplicity to show

522
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,200
the concept and the relationship

523
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,059
so like the new one

524
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,340
it it's great for I guess for the paper

525
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,860
that it was created but it doesn't show

526
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,620
the relationship as clear as the other

527
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,299
ones it's very simple

528
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,539
so I think that's why it was used maybe

529
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,000
like we move a lot of extra information

530
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,240
that the second paper illustrate like

531
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,220
study in it

532
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,980
but the Simplicity of that graph is why

533
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,919
like it really encapsible the concept

534
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,720
and it's also the reason why it's so

535
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,700
popular because it's so simple

536
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,919
so I think that's you know with a

537
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,840
relationship I think

538
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,340
I don't know how I see it

539
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,740
yep totally makes sense thank you

540
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,860
um and once we see that there is a

541
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,880
mapping

542
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,240
from the schematic cybernetic View

543
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,120
then we can probably fill in a lot of

544
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,220
the parts of the pmdp but just to look

545
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,380
One More Level here I mean the code I

546
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,080
posted the code below

547
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,659
so it's in Matlab

548
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,100
which people may or may not have access

549
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
to

550
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,460
oh sorry okay um Ali and then Ron

551
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,120
no I just wanted to point out one thing

552
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,679
that I forgot to mention before uh one

553
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,840
thing that might be helpful to keep in

554
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,539
mind is that actually in this generative

555
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,740
model there is a kind of unification or

556
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,940
kind of integration of interceptive and

557
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,159
extraceptive modalities because uh as

558
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,940
they pointed out in the paper uh this

559
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,779
agent this agent that they're modeling

560
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,919
uh adopt two modes of Engagement with

561
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,380
the world uh one of which is the relaxed

562
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,799
and the other one is uh the arouse

563
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,559
aroused mode of Engagement and because

564
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,260
of that there are two sorts of hidden

565
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,419
States related to each intercept of an

566
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,919
extraceptive one uh so I guess uh if

567
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,360
they wanted to put that kind of uh into

568
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,000
relationships between uh these kind of

569
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,380
modalities in that uh simplified

570
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,960
schematic model it wouldn't necessarily

571
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,600
clarify these kind of integration

572
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,080
between the the modalities so one reason

573
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,039
might be related to that I mean peculiar

574
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,059
a case of a particular situation of this

575
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:53,220
particular case here

576
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,820
thanks it also speaks to the step in the

577
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,820
model of the form of a generative model

578
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,740
and then I think when people get married

579
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,880
to

580
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,980
um the cybernetic scheme

581
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,720
you can imagine well then there's two

582
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,340
nodes inside of the internal States

583
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,559
there's two modes you can go between but

584
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,480
now you're like mixing and matching what

585
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,240
arrows mean where some of the arrows are

586
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,220
reflecting causal influence and some of

587
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,020
them are reflecting transitions between

588
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,179
mutually exclusive States

589
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,399
and so then we end up back into the

590
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,620
wireframe nightmare

591
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,559
where it's like a schematic

592
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,899
where some edges are tactile connections

593
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,700
and some are causal links and some are

594
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,260
mutually exclusive transfers of

595
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,059
information and all these other ways

596
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,340
that people visualize models

597
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,039
and this representation reminds us that

598
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,679
we're dealing with variables and states

599
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,899
and their connections Jessica

600
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,360
so I think that was from before okay but

601
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,500
yeah but I guess yes I think it's like

602
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,539
the visual

603
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,760
it has to do with what are you trying to

604
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,520
convey in that moment and you know how

605
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,640
much depth of information do you need I

606
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,200
think like at least say like for this

607
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,120
one you need extra information so that

608
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,740
all the model wouldn't work

609
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,179
well

610
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,000
just share like with the idea of what

611
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,460
the model is maybe this

612
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,120
um

613
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,100
version with the extra information might

614
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,200
be too complex for the other ones

615
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,120
there's a better purpose but it's like

616
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,860
what is the purpose he's trying to you

617
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,020
know

618
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,340
accomplish and what do you want to

619
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,419
communicate and depending on that then

620
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,679
models with more information and less

621
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,279
information are more successful

622
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,159
yep thank you totally agree I mean they

623
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,039
didn't do any of the loop at all they

624
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,020
just went straight to the pmdp

625
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,779
representation and also this isn't the

626
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,200
only form of an enteroceptive

627
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,880
extrareceptive integration model

628
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,820
one could brainstorm a whole host and

629
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,159
again that's what the recipe is for well

630
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,840
we could have a mutually exclusive

631
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,159
transfer

632
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,440
between these two states defined by

633
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,899
these two B matrices

634
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,659
which entails a policy variable

635
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,519
switching between the two

636
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,440
or we could have a continuous variable

637
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,100
called arousal and arousal is engaged in

638
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,960
some sort of attenuation relationship

639
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,980
here

640
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,980
so this isn't even the only form but it

641
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,320
shows us a form

642
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,439
um

643
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,080
okay

644
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,500
soon

645
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,240
in 20 minutes

646
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,039
we're going to be heading into chapter

647
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,779
7.

648
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,820
so let's preview it

649
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,159
so that when

650
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,519
we're working on this in the next week

651
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,559
preparing our questions starting to

652
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,140
think about what we want to be modeling

653
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,519
we'll kind of know what's going to

654
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,840
happen

655
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,539
all right chapter seven is active

656
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,980
inference in discrete time people can

657
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,039
still hear me okay I think so all right

658
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,659
so

659
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,399
here is where

660
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,860
we crossed the Rubicon

661
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,940
with modeling

662
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,220
this is abstract up till now

663
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,659
you cut out there for a second oh okay

664
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,899
okay I'm it's all good now

665
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,239
uh yeah just okay let's start from the

666
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,399
review thank you chapter seven we're

667
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,379
Crossing the Rubicon

668
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:29,760
together

669
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,800
and um it's been abstract up till now

670
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,320
first what is addressed

671
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,300
is perceptual processing

672
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,560
you'll find a lot of resonance between

673
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,480
this chapter 7.

674
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,580
and

675
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,418
step by step

676
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,399
which is model stream one

677
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,659
maybe it's step hyphen

678
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,280
yeah this paper step-by-step tutorial

679
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,000
is going to do a certain walk through

680
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,180
of adding incremental complexity into

681
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,640
the model in terms of model parameter

682
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,400
depth okay it's model stream one there's

683
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,380
four streams that Ryan and Chris White

684
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,820
did

685
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,920
static perception

686
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,260
Dynamic perception

687
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,720
Dynamic perception with preferences and

688
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
free energy minimization

689
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,740
Dynamic perception with free energy

690
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,440
minimization and flexible policy

691
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,859
selection through uncertainty modulation

692
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,660
we're going to do something similar in

693
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,339
chapter 7.

694
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,680
they

695
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,599
don't do that upper left corner of Step

696
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,000
by Step they go straight to Hidden

697
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,680
Markov models

698
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,079
for dynamic perception

699
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,440
this is analogous to a common filter or

700
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,180
any other number of General Bayesian

701
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,480
filtering schemes we have a prior d

702
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,700
hidden States s

703
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,680
and a sequence of observables through a

704
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
Time T that are mapped to Hidden States

705
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,180
a b describes how hidden States change

706
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,380
their time

707
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,660
so we have the temperature is a hidden

708
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,740
variable

709
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,140
and then we're getting observations from

710
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,640
the thermometer

711
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,140
that are mapped to the real temperature

712
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,119
by a Maybe it's a good thermometer maybe

713
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,740
it's biased or whatever

714
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,820
and then there's the temperature

715
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,599
changing Through Time

716
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,619
then there's a very um ali-centric

717
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,420
discussion of listening to music

718
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,820
this has to be one of the most glaring

719
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,440
errors in the textbook

720
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,020
it's very Warhol like though so maybe it

721
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,200
has a certain aesthetic to it

722
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,180
um but the example that's going to be

723
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,220
provided is like a musical listening

724
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,420
example

725
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,520
so

726
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,200
um the

727
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,760
a matrix is emitting notes

728
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,579
based upon the hidden state which is the

729
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,660
score of the music

730
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,240
the B Matrix is and seven they have 70

731
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,420
accuracy so this one-tenth distributes

732
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,160
through the Matrix

733
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,740
so it's just to use like integers here

734
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,859
but really this is like

735
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,300
0.7.1.1.1 because it has to add up to

736
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,200
one

737
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,200
but when this person when the hidden

738
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,060
state of the score is

739
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,700
in the first note they play it seventy

740
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,900
percent of the time and then the other

741
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,640
three notes they make an error ten

742
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,740
percent of the time each time

743
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,180
um seventy percent of the time the

744
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,619
musician hits their note

745
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,480
the B Matrix is how things change

746
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,040
through time the hidden state so this is

747
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,800
the transitions in the score

748
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,339
and here there's a 97 probability again

749
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,320
it's distributed throughout with this

750
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
one over a hundred just to represent it

751
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,740
with integers

752
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,740
and there's a prior with no uncertainty

753
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,079
or ambiguity of just it begins in the

754
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,440
first position

755
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,359
and so this we can even see like

756
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,740
you know I I don't want to use ABCD but

757
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,380
it would be like b c d a

758
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,760
in the musical ontology so here's b c d

759
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,980
a like that but then there is an error

760
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,260
in this one simulation run it'd be

761
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,700
probabilistic but they're showing for

762
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,000
didactic reasons a run where the third

763
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,020
what point in the third observation

764
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,760
there is an error

765
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,760
however it's heard as the correct value

766
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,440
that's a pure inference example this is

767
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,119
not active inference

768
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,820
this is just Bayesian models of

769
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,420
perception

770
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,640
this kind of sessile creature is rather

771
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,920
uninteresting

772
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,480
okay

773
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,420
Now we move from a hidden Markov model

774
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,820
Crouching Tiger Hidden Markov

775
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,000
into a partially observable Markov

776
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,280
decision process

777
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,740
a hidden Markov model is a partially

778
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,020
observable Markov model

779
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,880
because some parts of it are hidden some

780
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,220
are not but the key piece here is the

781
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,380
introduction of the decision

782
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,200
we know that we model that with policy

783
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,240
that influences how States change

784
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,380
Through Time

785
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,680
and that policy selection is governed by

786
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,420
G

787
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,180
figure four three

788
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,339
people can still hear because I see all

789
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,299
these like Frozen for me

790
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,859
okay okay all right okay thank you yeah

791
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,720
it's just strange stuff

792
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,980
um here's four three again

793
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,540
here

794
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,339
when we're talking about policy

795
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:54,480
selection

796
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,820
we're talking about states that haven't

797
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,800
happened yet observations and hidden

798
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,660
states that haven't happened yet

799
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,780
we see a restatement of equation 2.6

800
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,240
with expected free energy

801
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,000
here broken into epistemic and pragmatic

802
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,119
value

803
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,839
now to flesh out

804
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,900
this pomdp

805
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,140
we turn to a classic par and friston

806
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,760
example

807
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,680
which is the teamace

808
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,359
we're not going to go through every

809
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,900
single part of this teammate right now

810
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,839
but it'll be a key area for us to unpack

811
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,579
why do the matrices have the dimensions

812
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:44,160
that they have

813
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,140
where are the where are the four

814
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,780
locations that the mouse can be

815
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,579
you know here

816
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,520
down at the bottom to the left or to the

817
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,420
right

818
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,040
so this is not like a mouse moving in

819
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,839
continuous space it's like there are

820
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,579
four locations that can be in those are

821
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,560
the columns

822
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,720
there's five

823
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,220
hidden states of location

824
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,500
which we can see are Ike based upon

825
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,280
whether when it goes down to the bottom

826
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,859
to get a q

827
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,839
whether the hidden state is going to

828
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,200
reveal the Q or not

829
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,240
and then figure seven four and seven

830
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,740
five

831
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,780
you'll see differ first off one of them

832
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,520
is bolded this one is bolded this one's

833
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,900
unbolded

834
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,140
but here we see a one in the L column

835
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,140
because the black is on the L

836
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,660
and here we see a one in the r column

837
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,880
because the block is on the r

838
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,180
so understanding why that is

839
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,180
is going to be the Crux of understanding

840
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,060
how to construct

841
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,540
an epistemic informative cue

842
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,720
as a hidden environmental variable

843
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,240
in a generative model

844
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,820
here are the B matrices

845
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,640
transition probabilities

846
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,160
here's the preference vector

847
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,339
we'll talk about what C1 and C2 are

848
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,320
here are the priors

849
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,740
we'll talk about what D1 and D2 are

850
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,700
now there's more unpacking

851
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,760
of the epistemic value itself

852
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,119
so in the equation above there was a

853
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,820
restatement of equation 2.6 which

854
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,980
partitions the expected free energy into

855
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,900
the negative epistemic value and the

856
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,339
pragmatic value

857
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:38,040
now we're going to follow up

858
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,540
on the epistemic value

859
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,380
I of Pi the epistemic value of a policy

860
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,980
and break that down

861
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,560
into these representations

862
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,119
here are simulations

863
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,099
simulated epistemic and pragmatic

864
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,720
behavior of a rat foraging in a

865
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,579
teammates

866
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,920
so we'll try to model what these runs

867
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,880
are

868
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,740
I think it might be one small note about

869
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,660
the book that especially if they knew

870
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,819
that it was going to be black and white

871
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:22,400
which it seems like that was known

872
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,680
this is not Ultra helpful

873
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,260
perhaps people disagree

874
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,400
but another one this is what

875
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,480
said another Warhol

876
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,220
yeah this one this one you can even see

877
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,579
the Campbell Soup

878
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,260
but this I I think if someone was

879
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,359
familiar with reading these traces

880
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,740
they would still want to understand what

881
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,319
these different lines were

882
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,500
and like what the dashed one is

883
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,359
but if people are unfamiliar reading

884
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,578
these kinds of error residual traces

885
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,780
I don't know what is being shown here

886
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,060
um

887
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,240
figure 7.7

888
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,060
that was the simulation of the Rat

889
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,220
getting the epistemic cue and going to

890
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,119
the left

891
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,020
so instead of just taking a 50 50 shot

892
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,819
on where the food was

893
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:28,260
the rat

894
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,540
navigates this explore exploit dilemma

895
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,300
it engages in an epistemically oriented

896
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,240
action or an action driven by epistemic

897
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,200
value

898
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,560
to to reduce uncertainty get the cue

899
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,119
and then it secures the food

900
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,460
in this box 7-1

901
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,460
we see a discussion about

902
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,920
parameterization of uncertainty

903
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,560
and how Precision is the inverse of

904
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,760
variance

905
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,520
and this Omega

906
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,640
is the Precision variable here

907
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,359
just like Mark salms uses but others use

908
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,579
different ones

909
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,680
um

910
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,740
the lower this value is

911
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,400
the more even things are

912
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,400
and so this this has come up in the ice

913
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,040
cream example with the folk psychology

914
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,720
live stream

915
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,930
like if your C Vector is

916
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,260
[Music]

917
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,260
um

918
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,940
0 6 negative six

919
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,980
versus zero 500 negative 500 that's like

920
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,839
a sharper preference

921
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,819
distribution

922
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:49,200
so it's the quantitative values in the C

923
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,480
for example that's specified not just

924
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,400
the direction but also the intensity of

925
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,099
preference and then analogously

926
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,339
Precision can be specified in a

927
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,380
continuous form

928
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,260
here is a reference to a earlier par and

929
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,780
friston work on vision

930
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,720
that has to do with ocular motor

931
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,940
foraging which is heavily epistemically

932
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,079
driven

933
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,579
but then

934
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:15,839
they

935
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,000
um are using this example

936
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,020
to explore how precision

937
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,880
the viewer shows a version to the upper

938
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,920
left Square when it is specified with a

939
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,420
less precise

940
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,500
more ambiguous likelihood mapping

941
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,359
the lower left square is epistemically

942
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,380
attractive when the transition

943
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,300
probabilities are specified as more

944
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,720
uncertain

945
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:45,119
we'll try to understand these examples

946
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,619
learning a novelty 7.5

947
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,700
here we take that pomdp

948
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,859
and like we push it back in the

949
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,359
genealogy

950
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,099
now

951
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:02,339
we have a priors on the hidden states

952
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,619
which are themselves equipped with prior

953
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:05,640
beliefs

954
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,880
these are dear shlay conjugate priors

955
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,520
but they can be of other forms but

956
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,740
they're just shown as dirichlet here

957
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,480
because it's like a convenient

958
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,880
statistical distribution family

959
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,800
four variational inference which we

960
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,980
explored in several chapters ago

961
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,200
um these can be considered as hyper

962
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,460
priors

963
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,579
because they they but in the end just

964
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,579
variables on a graph and it's not like

965
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,319
they're tagged with being a hyper prior

966
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,540
and you can imagine priors that Nest on

967
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,060
them

968
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,040
exploring these potentially open-ended

969
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,380
Bayesian graph structures is why it's so

970
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,420
important to have structure learning

971
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,480
like Carl has pointed out for years and

972
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,180
why we want to have parameter sweeps

973
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,359
across cognitive model structures in

974
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,599
active block prints Because Why Stop why

975
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,020
not have another prior on this one

976
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,000
so we should have the notation and the

977
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,079
capacity to sweep that

978
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,520
here is a discussion on conjugate priors

979
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,260
a conjugate prior

980
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,359
means that when used to perform Bayesian

981
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,040
inference the posterior belief will be

982
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,839
the same type of distribution

983
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,520
so previously we talked about how like

984
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,140
the hidden State could be a continuous

985
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,240
variable and then the internal State

986
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,819
could be like a discrete variable you

987
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:28,440
know the temperature is continuous

988
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,380
outside and then inside is it hot or is

989
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,660
it cold is like what I'm caring about

990
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,200
so the families don't have to match

991
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,579
but when we use conjugate priors

992
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:45,359
it makes it so that

993
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,540
where you can design it to play nice it

994
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,280
does play nice

995
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,980
but we'll work through that

996
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,660
also with anybody who wants to go into

997
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,819
more detail on the math and because

998
00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:00,119
these are just like Bayesian statistics

999
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,720
points

1000
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,940
here Theta is used to just describe

1001
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,800
parameters it's a very common notation

1002
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,859
but not 100 pervasive to use Theta for

1003
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,560
parameters just generally

1004
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,160
um

1005
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,220
here there's more unpacking of the

1006
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,960
update rules this is probably of

1007
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
secondary consideration for just

1008
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,720
constructing a model

1009
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:31,140
here we return to expected free energy

1010
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,300
and several more representations Beyond

1011
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,859
What was seen above and beyond what was

1012
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:38,180
seen in equation 2.6

1013
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,500
here the learning model that was

1014
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,140
presented above the um pomdp with

1015
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,780
another generation of genealogy

1016
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,119
is described which is drawn from these

1017
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,780
two papers

1018
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,300
then structured learning is introduced

1019
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,400
we'll see how deep this one goes but

1020
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,440
these papers are quite

1021
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,300
interesting and connected to Bayesian

1022
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,900
model reduction

1023
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,599
here a hierarchical model is presented

1024
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,000
here's figure four three in the dashed

1025
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,440
box

1026
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,960
now there's a figure four three you know

1027
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,000
yo dog I heard you liked figure four

1028
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,240
three

1029
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,960
then there's another hierarchical model

1030
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,599
simulation from the above

1031
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,579
showing belief updating again with these

1032
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:29,720
Trace diagrams

1033
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,160
and then

1034
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,680
There's a summary

1035
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,060
so it's a somewhat long

1036
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,859
chapter

1037
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:44,160
it contains like the music example the

1038
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,210
rat example

1039
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:46,619
[Music]

1040
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:47,400
um

1041
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,240
the maze example the eye example

1042
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,640
so we're seeing like data points in

1043
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,540
model space

1044
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:55,800
[Music]

1045
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,800
um

1046
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,520
in the last three minutes does anyone

1047
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,260
have any thoughts or questions how are

1048
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,020
they going to tackle chapter seven

1049
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,660
and as they start to construct their

1050
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,859
model if they want to

1051
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,040
I am just a

1052
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,839
um

1053
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:28,079
every direction click that I can because

1054
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,940
it is

1055
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,460
quite dense still and kind of

1056
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,339
unapproachable I think for me anyways it

1057
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,859
just is quite difficult to like get a

1058
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:40,500
grasp on it from

1059
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,260
the textbook specifically

1060
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,099
um

1061
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:45,839
at this point like the degenerative

1062
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,180
model like what does that mean in code

1063
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,160
and where does that correlate to this

1064
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,660
particular function or that particular

1065
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,900
time step or whatever

1066
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,700
um it's you know I don't know it's just

1067
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,780
a lot

1068
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,940
and so I'm just trying to

1069
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,839
from yeah I don't know from just

1070
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,640
um

1071
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,099
generally building up simulations which

1072
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,859
are just things that you can you know

1073
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:16,260
put together in a browser like with

1074
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,020
simple JavaScript to like

1075
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,020
CAD Cad and active block rents and you

1076
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,240
know these sorts of things and

1077
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,160
trying to

1078
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,859
grasp at some real world situation so

1079
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:31,319
maybe that that rat you know teammates

1080
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:32,400
is a

1081
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,819
really good place to focus on

1082
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,040
um for me like a good intersection

1083
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,920
between the book and something that

1084
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,260
isn't like the frog jumping or is it not

1085
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,000
jumping is

1086
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,859
you know so contrived it's really

1087
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,319
difficult to think about modeling that

1088
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:52,140
and in a way that would help explain

1089
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,180
what's going it's like yes I knew the

1090
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,640
Frog was jumping or not jumping so that

1091
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,440
doesn't really help right

1092
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,640
um whereas

1093
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,000
the rat maybe coming up with some left

1094
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,880
or right hidden State based on the queue

1095
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,339
that's partially it's there's

1096
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:10,859
some explanatory power there that maybe

1097
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,380
realized I think so um

1098
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,380
I'm just yeah I don't know it's

1099
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,440
I'm trying to bridge jump over the Grand

1100
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,000
Canyon of the philosophical conceptual

1101
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,119
okay got it but the math there's a okay

1102
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,300
but there's a gap there for me so I'm

1103
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,140
trying to pull them together and it's

1104
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,720
uh yeah I have a question related to

1105
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,119
calibration of those priors and among

1106
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,200
other things

1107
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,119
uh is that ever explained as to how to

1108
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,520
go about doing that for

1109
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,319
any of these models

1110
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:50,640
yes

1111
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,960
so

1112
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,099
um

1113
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,680
model based data analysis

1114
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,780
is going to describe okay so it's it's

1115
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,240
okay it's in the future all right yeah

1116
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,640
I'll be for that chapter seven describes

1117
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,839
just in our last minute chapter 7

1118
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,760
describes the discrete State models

1119
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,859
chapter 8 describes continuous time

1120
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:10,920
models chapter 9 describes using

1121
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,319
empirical data for model driven data

1122
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,140
analysis chapter 10 is a summary

1123
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,220
the textbook is you know

1124
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,319
yeah we're excited towards the Grand

1125
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,420
Canyon but I think again we have several

1126
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,760
months to unpack this together so I hope

1127
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,280
that we can go quite far with this so

1128
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,800
um please stay engaged and add your

1129
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,500
questions and start building from both

1130
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,059
sides play with the code examples

1131
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,760
provided break them and then start from

1132
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,319
the other side with a recipe on a

1133
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,700
situation that you care about and then

1134
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,540
they're going to meet in the middle

1135
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,780
okay

1136
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,180
thank you everyone

1137
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,839
farewell

1138
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,280
bye
