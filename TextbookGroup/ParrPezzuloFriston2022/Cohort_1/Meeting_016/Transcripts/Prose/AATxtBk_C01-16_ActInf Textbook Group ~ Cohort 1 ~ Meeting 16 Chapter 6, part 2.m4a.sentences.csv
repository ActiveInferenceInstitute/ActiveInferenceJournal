170	1550	1	A	0.15427	You're okay.
1700	2398	2	A	0.79	Hello.
2564	4430	3	A	0.83461	It's September 16.
4850	9760	4	A	0.98279	We're in Cohort, one of the active textbook group.
10130	20522	5	A	0.99658	It's meeting 15, or I guess yes, no, 16 on let me just update the title meeting 16.
20586	23102	6	A	0.99301	We're in our second discussion on chapter six.
23236	40140	7	A	0.99614	So are there any any overall comments that people would like to address about chapter six or any other questions or points to add or just areas of chapter six that they found to be interesting.
64610	76740	8	B	0.93177	Distinction between the interceptive extraceptive modalities which have been mentioned in box 6.1.
78230	106170	9	B	0.7	And I think Kristen with Michael Allen, if I'm not mistaken, has published a recent paper just today, exactly on that topic, in which they've somehow tried to provide a computational model for the first time for the unification of the interceptive and extraceptive modalities.
106590	135190	10	B	0.99399	So since this chapter is also the modeling of those agents, I think this paper, from in the Body's Eye the computational anatomy of interceptive inference might be relevant for anyone who wants to model these modalities with the aid of active inference framework.
136890	137590	11	A	0.99968	Thank you.
137660	138326	12	A	0.99989	Very nice.
138428	139960	13	A	0.75989	Thanks for sharing it.
141370	144360	14	A	0.9825	Let's look at box 61.
169330	175970	15	A	0.8405	As people see it, what distinguishes exteriorceptive proprioceptive and interoceptive modalities?
179260	183480	16	A	0.9999	For example, why are proprioceptive and interceptive separated?
204760	207924	17	B	0.99826	Because I couldn't hear you.
207962	212292	18	B	1.0	I don't know if it's on my side or connection was unstable from your side.
212346	212950	19	B	1.0	Sorry.
213960	214916	20	A	1.0	Let me try something.
214938	216250	21	A	0.99294	I'll be on for a second.
228480	229630	22	A	0.85	Am I back?
230880	231388	23	A	1.0	Okay.
231474	231964	24	A	0.54408	So, yeah.
232002	232396	25	A	0.5414	What?
232498	234620	26	A	0.92	Yeah, brock, I do need a starlink.
236180	239760	27	A	0.9823	Why are proprioception and terraception separated?
241060	245408	28	A	0.51	And why are these three categories modeled as different?
245574	247490	29	A	0.99993	Why have they been framed as different.
271300	285312	30	B	0.88428	Biological and neurological mechanisms, neural mechanisms that somehow control those different kind of perceptions?
285376	318844	31	B	0.99999	Because for the extraceptive perception, the organism would necessarily need a kind of sensory I mean, the sensation it gets from the environment is just on the level of the imminent stimuli that it gets from the external environment.
318972	329556	32	B	0.99998	But for the interceptive modality, the sensation is just the internal sensations and so on.
329658	337552	33	B	0.75	And for the preceptive, it's related to motor control feedback loop.
337696	352104	34	B	0.79219	So I guess because of their different mechanisms it might be helpful to talk in different terms about each of them.
352222	355470	35	B	0.99999	But I'm not totally sure about that.
361280	361932	36	A	1.0	I agree.
361986	370560	37	A	0.72	I think one aspect, even in a pre blanket or non blanket modality is like they're about external things versus about internal things.
370710	390720	38	A	1.0	And then between proprioception and interoception, you're absolutely right that they have different neural mechanisms and physiological mechanisms with some blurry space, perhaps.
390880	402730	39	A	0.99999	For example, like interoception about blood pressure is somewhere in between, like a muscular reflex and an organ reflex, but the tissues being addressed are different.
403500	407348	40	A	0.99909	Let's look at this paper again.
407454	424530	41	A	0.90535	We'll return to the book, but we're going to be thinking today and then especially going forward with like, how do you identify the let's go to this question, which we just look at it.
425300	427200	42	A	0.99363	Which system are we modeling?
428420	430930	43	A	0.99999	What is the appropriate form for the generative model.
431300	433428	44	A	0.9744	How do we set up a generative model?
433594	435590	45	A	1.0	How do we set up a generative process?
436040	440340	46	A	0.9998	So let's see if we can determine some of those aspects.
440760	452200	47	A	1.0	In this paper, hashtag figure 43, it is the very same.
454810	469286	48	A	0.99	Okay, this is just a general pointing to a partially observable Markov decision process with a slight plus computational biology graphical veneer to match the color scheme.
469398	471920	49	A	1.0	Probably not, but it kind of looks like it.
475730	484820	50	A	1.0	Here is where we see the schematic of the form of the generative model.
488070	497490	51	A	0.79075	Variables are used to reflect that those variables can be fit from empirical data or just a priori set and simulated.
497650	500040	52	A	0.99998	But this is the form of the model.
500410	512860	53	A	0.99995	These are the shapes of the matrices and tensors that go from that are going to address what their model is about.
515230	520060	54	A	0.99997	Does anybody want to describe what they see in this?
522190	529870	55	A	0.5694	What do you think they were trying to explain and what do you think they were trying to model?
530020	533280	56	A	0.99984	What is their system of interest based upon what you see here?
538790	550626	57	B	0.99915	Actually, one interesting term that I came up with used in this paper is cardiac active inference.
550818	565990	58	B	0.92	The term that they've used in this paper to describe the kind of interrelationship between the heart rhythm and the interception.
566150	579530	59	B	0.99874	So this generative model, I believe, is just about modeling that relationship between the heart rhythm and the interception.
579610	599750	60	B	0.99654	So we can see, as usual, the B matrices C and A matrices that we've seen before, but in this case, they've been applied to the variation in the heart rhythm and how it relates to the interception.
601210	601960	61	A	1.0	Yes.
602330	622400	62	A	0.66995	So again, using the variables that we know from figure four three in the book and their figure one here, the hidden states that are not directly observed are on the interceptive side relating to the state of the heart.
623410	629470	63	A	0.85611	On the exteriorceptive side, whether there is a flower or a spider.
632130	645300	64	A	1.0	The outcomes that are observed are the visual exterocception of a flower or a spider and the heart rate probably a low and a high heart rate.
647610	665174	65	A	0.76	The piece that links these two is the sensory attenuation between the high heart rate state and the mapping of exterocception in the B matrix.
665302	670140	66	A	1.0	You can just see that even the allocation of the symbols is different.
671410	679470	67	A	0.99994	Like when you're aroused, when you're in, this is like heart open and then heart contract.
680450	686980	68	A	0.99992	So when you're in the aroused situation, b is how the hidden states change their time.
687670	704360	69	A	0.99917	You're always going to go from here to here, whereas in the relaxed situation, sometimes you go from this state to this one.
706650	711340	70	A	0.99997	Other times you're relaxed and so you dwell within that state.
711870	717180	71	A	0.99872	So here it's like pump rest, pump rest, pump rest.
717630	720630	72	A	1.0	Here it's 50% slower.
720710	732750	73	A	0.7005	Just it depends on the parameters, but it's 50% slower because sometimes you're going to go from one, but it looks like as it's here that it's actually like or it's twice as slow.
733430	735086	74	A	0.89183	Rest, rest, beat.
735198	736770	75	A	0.99644	Rest, rest, beat.
737110	740020	76	A	0.99991	So these are the two interoceptive states.
742950	753640	77	A	1.0	One has a preference for having relaxed hearts when flowers are around and having contracted heart when spiders are around.
755290	769610	78	A	1.0	The A matrix maps on these two sensory modalities between hidden states and outcome states, just like any A matrix would do in any POMDP.
770430	776080	79	A	1.0	And then there's also a transition matrix of the generative process.
777170	788274	80	A	0.9995	So it's a very simple generative process where either flowers are flowers or spiders are spiders, as they would say.
788312	791646	81	A	1.0	You can use standard routines to simulate these techniques.
791678	793540	82	A	0.92	I hope that the code are available.
795030	802050	83	A	1.0	You can plot parameter sweeps as you explore the beta and alpha.
803370	807030	84	A	0.99984	So here's, like the beta parameter and alpha parameter.
808170	816726	85	A	0.99992	So you can do parameter sweeps with this grid search or other approaches and then do statistics on those outputs.
816918	819174	86	A	0.99999	Is this quote active inference?
819302	823600	87	A	0.9929	Well, it's the output of a parameter sweep on an active inference model.
824850	826586	88	A	0.92212	There's various other kinds of methods.
826618	841780	89	A	0.99936	So, not to spend too much time on the paper, but does anyone have any thoughts on that case or how they see it applying to chapter six as content?
850980	857570	90	A	0.97	I think it speaks to a fulfillment cycle in active inference research.
859540	860290	91	A	0.77	Oh.
886900	889890	92	B	1.0	This worked example helps a lot.
891860	916344	93	B	0.62	I mean, if anyone wants to, especially because describing this kind of cardiac active inference as a kind of system that has a definite Markov blanket, it was really interesting question at the first place.
916462	943330	94	B	1.0	And I think they've done really great job, obviously, in that regard and thinking really creatively and out of the box about how we can describe that whole system with the aid of using markup blankets to describe its internal and external environment and so on.
945140	949750	95	A	0.99945	It also relates to this earlier question.
950200	961348	96	A	0.90297	So how does the figure 43 paradigm discrete and continuous state spaces with all the attending complexities?
961524	962920	97	A	0.95928	Do you hear me, Ollie?
964860	973050	98	A	0.7	Okay, how does this representation connect to.
974460	976512	99	B	0.99997	Can you hear, Daniel?
976676	978110	100	A	0.68	Yeah, I can.
980640	982492	101	A	0.99978	It's a story for another day.
982626	986960	102	A	0.97925	Some of the incredible, the truly incredible Internet.
987380	988544	103	A	0.76046	I'm going to try one thing.
988582	990928	104	A	0.74644	So I think that or Holly, can.
990934	991376	105	B	1.0	You hear me now?
991398	992130	106	B	0.95	Or no.
995680	996910	107	A	0.88596	I'll try something.
1020430	1024422	108	A	0.73288	It here's what's interesting with the Wi Fi.
1024486	1039200	109	A	0.98	And then we'll continue, because it's not a Wi Fi learning group, but with the Hotspot, there are a set of people who I cannot interact with, but with WiFi, I am able to interact with those people.
1041190	1042450	110	A	0.99986	Just a note.
1042790	1047970	111	A	0.99564	So we see the POMDP representation.
1049030	1063280	112	A	1.0	Now, what is not in this paper here is a graphical layout of the POMDP.
1065220	1065970	113	A	0.99	Okay?
1066340	1067856	114	A	0.99998	What is not in this paper?
1068038	1073780	115	A	0.98	A figure six one, or indeed a figure eleven representation.
1077370	1083750	116	A	0.99787	So why is that's?
1089710	1099902	117	B	0.66851	I'm not sure I've understood your question quite clearly, but could you please elaborate on that a little bit more?
1100036	1100814	118	A	0.98	Yes, sure.
1100932	1111838	119	A	0.99959	So when we look at papers like Vassal at all, communication is active inference social, inactive, active inference, loops, loops, loops, viotkin at all remote teams.
1111934	1119140	120	A	0.87544	Loops, loops, loops, Markov blanket interface loops, entities, things.
1121610	1130600	121	A	0.89007	Yet in the application, what is specified is not the loopy situation.
1131450	1137260	122	A	1.0	What needs to be specified is chapter six, not chapter one.
1138590	1160450	123	A	0.99986	So I find that very interesting because so much of the focus attention, discourse has been around abstractions, around Markov blankets and their interpretations from various stances and about boundaries, physical boundaries and conceptual boundaries.
1162710	1169540	124	A	0.99523	But it's a non controversy when it's written this way.
1170710	1177426	125	A	0.86	And there are Markov blankets between many of these variables because it's a Bayesian graph that's not fully connected.
1177458	1180754	126	A	0.99999	So every Bayesian graph that's not fully connected has Markov blankets.
1180882	1181750	127	A	0.56464	Trivially.
1183310	1193260	128	A	0.77818	But this paper doesn't need to describe what is.
1193630	1197078	129	A	1.0	This is enough to say what's inside and outside the organismal.
1197094	1212290	130	A	0.99265	Markov blanket, if we want to even think about it, is like here in this line, kind of not on the Bayes graph, but it's between the spider and the flower outside and the vision of the spider and the flower.
1213270	1240342	131	A	0.99992	But that's like taken care of with the a matrix of the exterocceptive modality, which is, I think, why this recipe does not focus on which thing are we modeling, but rather which system are we modeling.
1240486	1247680	132	A	1.0	And yes, we're going to pursue the generative model before the generative process, even though they may have symmetry or they may be very similar.
1250050	1279670	133	A	1.0	But I just find it very interesting, open to hearing what people think, like why the Cybernetic loop action perception loop is used so much in contrast with the form of the model that's actually implemented, which is a different topology in a different discussion.
1281930	1284310	134	A	1.0	I know that they're integrated and compatible.
1295060	1327340	135	B	0.99738	Just one comment on that is, you see, at least to my understanding, markup blanket is a kind of modeling tool or a way of thinking about basically the ontology of I mean ontology in the sense of its philosophical use, the ontology of the system that we're about to model.
1327490	1346736	136	B	0.78516	So it's not necessarily the relationships among the different components of the markup blanket is something not necessarily physical or tangible relationships in that system.
1346838	1365848	137	B	0.77092	So it might be kind of just informational, as we saw in, I think, chapter five, if I'm not mistaken, the information passing among the different components and so on.
1365934	1396240	138	B	0.77481	So at least I think the reason for not using the Schematic model of markup I mean the Cybernetic model of Markup blanket instead of using just the Schematic form, probably it's because of this kind of, let's say nonphysical or nontangible relationship among the different components.
1396660	1409780	139	B	0.99992	By nontangible and nonphysical I mean something that can't be explained in terms of its ontological existence.
1412120	1418650	140	B	1.0	I don't know if I could express myself in that regard or not.
1421100	1424090	141	A	0.99969	Thank you, Elite, Brock and anyone else.
1427680	1450130	142	C	0.98	I was just going to I don't know, I feel like personally, I'm just kind of at the affordances that I have to get pragmatic and epistemic value here without doing some modeling of some kind.
1454200	1455670	143	C	0.98	Yeah, I don't know.
1456680	1457430	144	A	1.0	Good.
1458920	1459572	145	A	0.98804	Thanks.
1459706	1467656	146	A	0.93	I mean, this is the second discussion on chapter six, and then this is setting us up to actually pursue a model.
1467758	1470090	147	A	0.99999	So we should be preparing these.
1470940	1471592	148	C	0.71	Yeah.
1471726	1475370	149	C	0.99436	I'm just saying it's definitely ripe for that.
1477740	1478536	150	A	0.95	Yes.
1478718	1479800	151	A	0.82957	Rohan.
1481740	1495710	152	D	0.98	Yeah, actually, just to get some clarification, you're asking why the form of the model is as mentioned in chapter six of the project given in chapter six, which is chapter one.
1499360	1500084	153	A	1.0	Yes.
1500242	1502432	154	A	0.99	I mean, they're compatible.
1502496	1508260	155	A	0.98888	Topologies that actually are describing an overlapping set of notes.
1510040	1530540	156	A	1.0	I was just calling attention to the amount of discourse and focus on the potentially more familiar, more schematic action perception loop and the way that that draws so much attention to the organism environment interface.
1531440	1543090	157	A	0.99994	Whereas when it comes to the empirical modeling, that interface never had to be specified as like a first class type.
1544580	1546850	158	A	0.74911	It just was included by the buy.
1547300	1556740	159	A	0.99997	We just said there are spiders and flowers out there, hidden states, s, and then there's observations of and there's no error.
1558920	1559824	160	A	0.86689	There's no error.
1559872	1560180	161	D	0.77	Right.
1560250	1565128	162	D	0.9636	But there would be no error in the generative process itself.
1565214	1575772	163	D	0.95	The model might have error that comes from some measurement issue.
1575826	1576524	164	D	0.43	Right?
1576722	1585736	165	D	0.93918	So when you measure it and you confuse, say, spider for flower or flower for spider, then you would get some error.
1585768	1594530	166	D	0.95	And there may be that's where I guess you can talk about the markup blanket misspecifying or misobserving something.
1595460	1599664	167	D	0.7093	So I'm not sure what exactly is.
1599702	1600290	168	B	0.7	The.
1602420	1604530	169	D	0.58	I mean, they're compatible, right?
1605800	1607600	170	D	1.0	In this case, there's no error.
1607760	1612790	171	D	0.99998	But if there was error, obviously there would be something wrong with the.
1614700	1617112	172	A	1.0	Let me actually just correct this.
1617166	1622132	173	A	1.0	I believe be I didn't mean to say this is the visual error.
1622196	1626940	174	A	1.0	This is saying that they're unchanging flowers, so they're either one or the other.
1627090	1627788	175	A	0.58	Here.
1627954	1632220	176	A	0.99949	Parametrically it's possible to introduce visual error in the A matrix.
1632640	1641730	177	A	0.99996	But I'm just pointing to the architecture of the model doesn't require even engaging with this.
1643460	1645212	178	A	0.66989	It's totally compatible.
1645356	1664010	179	A	0.52	And the observations are the sense states and the actions are the active states and so on, but as presented and as constructed, if we're going to use a POMDP architecture, we don't necessarily even need a representation like this.
1668780	1669530	180	D	1.0	Yeah.
1671260	1674010	181	D	0.77782	Jessica okay, that's interesting.
1678480	1678940	182	E	0.57396	Hi.
1679010	1679630	183	E	0.95	Yes.
1680960	1694096	184	E	0.99995	For me, the reason why it's like two parts, the reason why the craft is so popular, and I think maybe it's also the reason why it was used.
1694198	1700944	185	E	0.6	And this is the simplicity to show the concept and the relationship like the new one.
1701142	1708852	186	E	0.77671	It's great for, I guess, for the paper that it was created, but it doesn't show the relationship as clear as the other ones.
1708906	1710084	187	E	0.53938	It's very simple.
1710282	1713140	188	E	0.99906	So I think that's why it was used.
1713210	1720730	189	E	0.99994	Maybe like, remove a lot of extra information that the second paper illustrates in it.
1721180	1726740	190	E	0.99119	But the simplicity of that graph is why it really encapsulates the concept.
1726900	1730524	191	E	1.0	And it's also the reason why it's so popular, because it's so simple.
1730722	1736750	192	E	0.59	I think that's the relationship, I think, from how I see it.
1738880	1740412	193	A	0.92	Yes, totally makes sense.
1740466	1741330	194	A	0.99999	Thank you.
1742260	1753288	195	A	1.0	And once we see that there is a mapping from the Schematic cybernetic view, then we can probably fill in a lot of the parts of the PMDP.
1753324	1763830	196	A	0.99877	But just to look one more level here, I posted the code below, so it's in MATLAB which people may or may not have access to.
1764200	1764612	197	A	0.91	Sorry.
1764666	1765076	198	A	1.0	Okay.
1765178	1766840	199	A	0.98596	Ali and then Ron.
1770140	1775290	200	B	0.86	No, I just wanted to point out one thing that I forgot to mention before.
1777100	1791548	201	B	1.0	One thing that might be helpful to keep in mind is that actually, in this generative model, there is a kind of unification, or kind of integration of interceptive and extraceptive modalities.
1791644	1812544	202	B	0.99999	Because, as they pointed out in the paper, this agent that they're modeling adopts two modes of engagement with the world, one of which is the relaxed and the other one is the aroused mode of engagement.
1812672	1819784	203	B	1.0	And because of that, there are two sorts of hidden states related to each interceptive and extraceptive one.
1819982	1841732	204	B	0.9996	So I guess if they wanted to put that kind of interrelationships between these kind of modalities in that simplified schematic model, it wouldn't necessarily clarify these kind of integration between the modalities.
1841816	1852290	205	B	0.99991	So one reason might be related to that peculiar situation of this particular case here.
1853300	1854096	206	A	0.99978	Thanks.
1854278	1859668	207	A	0.99998	It also speaks to the step in the model of the form of a generative model.
1859834	1868372	208	A	0.74	And then I think when people get married to the cybernetic scheme, you can imagine, well, then there's two nodes inside of the internal states.
1868426	1870040	209	A	0.9993	There's two modes you can go between.
1870190	1880750	210	A	0.99999	But now you're like, mixing and matching what arrows mean, where some of the arrows are reflecting causal influence and some of them are reflecting transitions between mutually exclusive states.
1881120	1898188	211	A	1.0	And so then we end up back into the wireframe nightmare, where it's like a schematic, where some edges are tactile connections and some are causal links and some are mutually exclusive transfers of information and all these other ways that people visualize models.
1898364	1905472	212	A	1.0	And this representation reminds us that we're dealing with variables and states and their connections.
1905616	1906580	213	A	0.90885	Jessica.
1911020	1912648	214	E	1.0	I think that was from before.
1912814	1913530	215	E	0.67	Okay.
1916780	1928124	216	E	0.74	I think the visual has to do with what are you trying to convey in that moment and how much depth of information do you need?
1928322	1933616	217	E	0.78	I think, like, at least for this one, you need an extra information so that all the model wouldn't work.
1933798	1938816	218	E	0.63853	Well, just share with the idea of what the model is.
1938918	1945072	219	E	1.0	Maybe this version with the extra information might be too complex for the other one.
1945126	1946560	220	E	0.95564	There's a better purpose.
1947000	1952960	221	E	0.99998	What is the purpose you're trying to accomplish, and what do you want to communicate?
1953120	1959720	222	E	1.0	And depending on that, then models with more information or less information are more successful.
1961260	1961912	223	A	0.95	Yes.
1962046	1962728	224	A	0.99998	Thank you.
1962814	1963512	225	A	0.60805	Totally agree.
1963566	1966792	226	A	0.98	I mean, they didn't do any of the loop at all.
1966846	1970040	227	A	1.0	They just went straight to the PMDP representation.
1970200	1976510	228	A	1.0	And also, this isn't the only form of an interoceptive exterocceptive integration model.
1976880	1979432	229	A	0.51	One could brainstorm a whole host.
1979496	1981632	230	A	1.0	And again, that's what the recipe is for.
1981766	1994070	231	A	0.99647	Well, we could have a mutually exclusive transfer between these two states defined by these two B matrices, which entails a policy variable switching between the two.
1994520	1998160	232	A	1.0	Or we could have a continuous variable called arousal.
1998320	2002756	233	A	1.0	And arousal is engaged in some sort of attenuation relationship here.
2002938	2007450	234	A	0.99989	So this isn't even the only form, but it shows us a form.
2010700	2018910	235	A	0.99	Okay, soon, in 20 minutes, we're going to be heading into chapter seven.
2019680	2034130	236	A	0.93799	So let's preview it so that when we're working on this in the next week, preparing our questions, starting to think about what we want to be modeling, we'll kind of know what's going to happen.
2034820	2038624	237	A	0.7	All right, chapter seven is active inference in discrete time.
2038662	2039904	238	A	0.99998	People can still hear me okay.
2039942	2040560	239	A	0.84	I think so.
2040630	2049220	240	A	0.53	All right, so here is where we cross the rubicon with modeling.
2052250	2054520	241	A	1.0	This is abstract up till now.
2056590	2058170	242	C	0.52	You cut out there for a second.
2058320	2059020	243	A	0.99	Okay.
2059630	2060940	244	A	0.94769	It's all good now.
2062110	2062522	245	C	0.76	Yeah.
2062576	2064442	246	C	0.93479	Just start from the review.
2064496	2065002	247	A	0.56954	Thank you.
2065056	2073280	248	A	0.56593	Chapter seven, we're crossing the rubicon together, and it's been abstract up till now.
2074850	2079178	249	A	1.0	First, what is addressed is perceptual processing.
2079354	2092980	250	A	0.88812	You'll find a lot of resonance between this chapter seven and Step by Step, which is model stream one.
2093350	2095090	251	A	0.99991	Maybe it's Stephen.
2098730	2112118	252	A	1.0	This paper step by step tutorial is going to do a certain walkthrough of adding incremental complexity into the model in terms of model parameter depth.
2112214	2112810	253	A	0.85	Okay.
2112960	2114106	254	A	0.9762	It's model stream one.
2114128	2117100	255	A	0.53926	There's four streams that Ryan and Chris White did.
2117790	2126030	256	A	0.99995	Static perception, dynamic perception, dynamic perception with preferences and free energy minimization.
2126930	2133730	257	A	0.99795	Dynamic perception with free energy minimization and flexible policy selection through uncertainty modulation.
2134790	2137780	258	A	0.99786	We're going to do something similar in chapter seven.
2138470	2142962	259	A	0.99996	They don't do that upper left corner of step by step.
2143016	2148710	260	A	0.91203	They go straight to hidden Markov models for dynamic perception.
2149130	2155314	261	A	1.0	This is analogous to a Coleman filter or any other number of General Bayesian filtering schemes.
2155442	2163690	262	A	0.99736	We have a prior D hidden states S and a sequence of observables through time T that are mapped to hidden states.
2163760	2167034	263	A	1.0	A B describes how hidden states change through time.
2167232	2170486	264	A	0.99989	So we have the temperature is a hidden variable.
2170678	2176782	265	A	1.0	And then we're getting observations from the thermometer that are mapped to the real temperature by A.
2176836	2179518	266	A	1.0	Maybe it's a good thermometer, maybe it's biased or whatever.
2179684	2182000	267	A	1.0	And then there's the temperature changing through time.
2184370	2189940	268	A	0.99997	Then there's a very Ollie Centric discussion of listening to music.
2190870	2194870	269	A	1.0	This has to be one of the most glaring errors in the textbook.
2196810	2202440	270	A	0.90592	It's very warhol like, though, so maybe it has a certain aesthetic to it.
2203530	2207900	271	A	0.99999	But the example that's going to be provided is like a musical listening example.
2208510	2220960	272	A	0.95552	So the A matrix is emitting notes based upon the hidden state, which is the score of the music.
2222770	2227466	273	A	1.0	The B matrix is and they have 70% accuracy.
2227578	2230590	274	A	0.99996	So this one 10th distributes through the matrix.
2231010	2233566	275	A	0.97128	So it's just to use, like, integers here.
2233748	2238946	276	A	1.0	But really this is like zero 7.1.1 .1, because it has to add up to one.
2239128	2247154	277	A	0.99995	But when this person, when the hidden state of the score is in the first note, they play it 70% of the time.
2247192	2250054	278	A	1.0	And then the other three notes, they make an error 10% of the time.
2250092	2254402	279	A	1.0	Each time, 70% of the time, the musician hits their note.
2254546	2257654	280	A	0.74	The B matrix is how things change through time, the hidden state.
2257692	2260250	281	A	0.52106	So this is the transitions in the score.
2260670	2263990	282	A	0.74	And here there's a 97% probability.
2264070	2269370	283	A	0.85871	Again, it's distributed throughout with this one over 100 just to represent it with integers.
2269810	2275840	284	A	1.0	And there's a prior with no uncertainty or ambiguity of just it begins in the first position.
2277650	2289646	285	A	1.0	And so this we can even see, like do do you know, I don't want to use ABCD, but it would be like BCDA in the musical ontology.
2289838	2293538	286	A	0.99994	So here's BCCDA like that.
2293704	2298822	287	A	1.0	But then there is an error in this one simulation run.
2298876	2309130	288	A	0.64598	It'd be probabilistic, but they're showing for didactic reasons, a run where the third point in the third observation, there is an error.
2309790	2312940	289	A	0.99921	However, it's heard as the correct value.
2317230	2319402	290	A	0.97354	That's a pure inference example.
2319536	2321930	291	A	1.0	This is not active inference.
2322290	2325790	292	A	1.0	This is just Bayesian models of perception.
2331010	2334910	293	A	0.85	This kind of sessile creature is rather uninteresting.
2335990	2347700	294	A	0.95	Okay, now we move from a hidden Markov model crotching tiger, hidden Markov, into a partially observable Markov decision process.
2348230	2355446	295	A	1.0	A hidden Markov model is a partially observable Markov model because some parts of it are hidden, some are not.
2355548	2358710	296	A	1.0	But the key piece here is the introduction of the decision.
2359390	2369340	297	A	1.0	We know that we model that with policy that influences how states change their time, and that policy selection is governed by g.
2370350	2376640	298	A	0.99799	Figure four three people can still hear because I see all these, like, frozen for me.
2378530	2379838	299	A	0.99	Okay, all right.
2379924	2380606	300	A	0.56	Okay, thank you.
2380628	2400280	301	A	1.0	Yeah, it's just strange stuff here's four three again, here when we're talking about policy selection, we're talking about states that haven't happened yet, observations, and hidden states that haven't happened yet.
2400650	2409480	302	A	1.0	We see a restatement of equation 2.6 with expected free energy here, broken into epistemic and pragmatic value.
2413180	2426040	303	A	1.0	Now, to flesh out this POMDP, we turn to a classic par and Friston example, which is the teammase.
2428800	2438000	304	A	0.9998	We're not going to go through every single part of this teammase right now, but it'll be a key area for us to unpack.
2439060	2442530	305	A	1.0	Why do the matrices have the dimensions that they have?
2445220	2454116	306	A	0.99993	Where are the four locations that the mouse can be here, down at the bottom, to the left or to the right?
2454298	2456900	307	A	0.9985	So this is not like a mouse moving in continuous space.
2456970	2459204	308	A	0.9965	It's like there are four locations it can be in.
2459242	2460580	309	A	0.99998	Those are the columns.
2461580	2480750	310	A	0.99833	There's five hidden states of location which we can see are like, based upon whether when it goes down to the bottom to get a queue, whether the hidden state is going to reveal the queue or not.
2482160	2486828	311	A	1.0	And then figure seven, four and 75 you'll see differ.
2486914	2490480	312	A	1.0	First off, one of them is bolded, this one is bolded, this one's unbolded.
2490900	2496848	313	A	0.82535	But here we see a one in the L column because the black is on the L.
2497014	2501716	314	A	0.67	And here we see a one in the R column because the black is on the R.
2501898	2519210	315	A	0.99993	So understanding why that is is going to be the crux of understanding how to construct an epistemic informative q as a hidden environmental variable in a generative model.
2520220	2524620	316	A	1.0	Here are the B matrices transition probabilities.
2525600	2527740	317	A	0.99854	Here's the preference vector.
2528160	2531084	318	A	0.99974	We'll talk about what C one and C two are.
2531282	2535790	319	A	1.0	Here are the priors we'll talk about what D one and D two are.
2536820	2543010	320	A	0.99	Now there's more unpacking of the epistemic value itself.
2543780	2555030	321	A	0.99994	So in the equation above there was a restatement of equation 2.6 which partitions the expected free energy into the negative epistemic value and the pragmatic value.
2555400	2575880	322	A	1.0	Now we're going to follow up on the epistemic value I of pi the epistemic value of a policy and break that down into these representations.
2580330	2587430	323	A	0.58	Here are simulations, simulated epistemic and pragmatic behavior of a rat foraging in a teammates.
2588490	2591590	324	A	0.87372	So we'll try to model what these runs are.
2591740	2607010	325	A	0.76	I think it might be one small note about the book that especially if they knew that it was going to be black and white, which it seems like that was known, this is not ultra helpful.
2608630	2610370	326	A	0.99974	Perhaps people disagree.
2611270	2612914	327	A	0.88422	But another war.
2613112	2616950	328	C	0.75293	What said another warhol?
2618490	2622550	329	A	0.74	Yeah, this one you can even see the Campbell soup.
2624090	2637420	330	A	0.99499	But I think if someone were familiar with reading these traces, they would still want to understand what these different lines were and like what the dashed one is.
2638350	2654820	331	A	0.89553	But if people are unfamiliar reading these kinds of error residual traces, I don't know what is being shown here figure 7.7.
2655270	2660898	332	A	0.99995	That was the simulation of the rat getting the epistemic queue and going to the left.
2661064	2670754	333	A	0.5457	So instead of just taking a 50 50 shot on where the food was, the rat navigates this explore exploit dilemma.
2670882	2682460	334	A	0.99795	It engages in an epistemically oriented action or an action driven by epistemic value to reduce uncertainty, get the queue and then it secures the food.
2684990	2696270	335	A	1.0	In this box 71 we see a discussion about parameterization of uncertainty and how precision is the inverse of variance.
2696770	2707540	336	A	1.0	And this omega is the precision variable here, just like Mark Solms uses, but others use different ones.
2710710	2716520	337	A	1.0	The lower this value is, the more even things are.
2717370	2724390	338	A	1.0	And so this has come up in the ice cream example with the folk psychology live stream.
2724810	2743930	339	A	0.9079	Like if your c vector is zero six negative six versus zero 500 negative 500, that's like a sharper preference distribution.
2744750	2754114	340	A	0.99995	So it's the quantitative values in the C, for example, that specified not just the direction but also the intensity of preference.
2754262	2760320	341	A	0.81	And then analogously precision can be specified in a continuous form.
2761410	2772878	342	A	1.0	Here is a reference to an earlier par and Friston work on vision that has to do with ocular motor foraging, which is heavily epistemically driven.
2773054	2788994	343	A	0.57247	But then they are using this example to explore how precision the viewer shows a version to the upper left square when it is specified with a less precise, more ambiguous likelihood.
2789042	2797210	344	A	0.99659	Mapping the lower left square is epistemically attractive when the transition probabilities are specified as more uncertain.
2801770	2804310	345	A	0.96418	We'll try to understand these examples.
2805130	2816970	346	A	0.99991	Learning a Novelty 7.5 here we take that POMDP and we push it back in the genealogy.
2817470	2825418	347	A	1.0	Now we have priors on the hidden states which are themselves equipped with prior beliefs.
2825594	2831050	348	A	1.0	These are dear Schlee conjugate priors, but they can be of other forms.
2831130	2842020	349	A	0.99995	But they're just shown as dear Schlee here because it's like a convenient statistical distribution family for variational inference which we explored in several chapters ago.
2843510	2850898	350	A	0.99754	These can be considered as hyper priors, but in the end just variables on the graph.
2851074	2857000	351	A	1.0	And it's not like they're tagged with being a hyper prior and you can imagine priors that nest on them.
2858190	2875546	352	A	0.4927	Exploring these potentially open ended Bayesian graph structures is why it's so important to have structure learning, like Karl has pointed out for years, and why we want to have parameter sweeps across cognitive model structures in active block prints.
2875658	2876878	353	A	0.99995	Because why stop?
2877044	2880080	354	A	0.92589	Why not have another prior on this one?
2880930	2884500	355	A	0.98811	So we should have the notation and the capacity to sweep that.
2886550	2889970	356	A	0.65	Here is a discussion on conjugate priors.
2891430	2898578	357	A	1.0	A conjugate prior means that when used to perform Bayesian inference, the posterior belief will be the same type of distribution.
2898754	2906470	358	A	0.99997	So previously we talked about how like the hidden state could be a continuous variable and then the internal state could be like a discrete variable.
2906970	2911814	359	A	0.51	The temperature is continuous outside and then inside is it hot or is it cold?
2911862	2913434	360	A	0.90749	Is like what I'm caring about.
2913632	2916780	361	A	0.99976	So the families don't have to match.
2917310	2927902	362	A	0.99999	But when we use conjugate priors it makes it so that where you can design it to play nice.
2928036	2940820	363	A	0.99993	It does play nice, but we'll work through that also with anybody who wants to go into more detail on the math because these are just like Bayesian statistics points.
2943510	2946498	364	A	1.0	Here theta is used to just describe parameters.
2946594	2957814	365	A	0.9999	It's a very common notation, but not 100% pervasive to use theta for parameters, just generally here there's more unpacking of the update rules.
2957862	2962060	366	A	1.0	This is probably of secondary consideration for just constructing a model.
2966470	2976520	367	A	0.77	Here we return to expected free energy and several more representations beyond what was seen above and beyond what was seen in equation 2.6.
2978730	2989130	368	A	1.0	Here the learning model that was presented above the POMDP with another generation of genealogy is described which is drawn from these two papers.
2991150	2993930	369	A	0.65905	Then structured learning is introduced.
2994270	2996134	370	A	0.99982	We'll see how deep this one goes.
2996192	3001310	371	A	0.9947	But these papers are quite interesting and connected to Bayesian model reduction.
3003330	3009600	372	A	1.0	Here a hierarchical model is presented here's figure 43 in the dashed box.
3010450	3013762	373	A	1.0	Now there's a figure 43 yo dog.
3013816	3015620	374	A	1.0	I heard you liked figure four, three.
3018230	3028070	375	A	1.0	Then there's another hierarchical model simulation from the above showing belief updating again with these trace diagrams.
3030330	3033430	376	A	0.55	And then there's a summary.
3034670	3040170	377	A	0.95047	So it's a somewhat long chapter.
3040910	3050000	378	A	0.99988	It contains like, the music example, the rat example, the maze example, the eye example.
3051170	3061794	379	A	0.99875	So we're seeing like, data points in model space, um, in the last three minutes.
3061912	3063810	380	A	0.99978	Does anyone have any thoughts or questions?
3063880	3066100	381	A	0.99992	How are they going to tackle chapter seven?
3067110	3071380	382	A	0.99	And as they start to construct their model, if they want to?
3079940	3108072	383	C	0.91	I am just every direction that I can because it is quite dense still and kind of unapproachable, I think, for me anyways, it just is quite difficult to get a grasp on it from the textbook specifically at this point, like the generative model, like, what does that mean in code?
3108126	3113550	384	C	0.54	And where does that correlate to this particular function or that particular time step or whatever?
3115520	3116076	385	C	0.54	I don't know.
3116098	3117310	386	C	0.89635	It's just a lot.
3117760	3119950	387	C	1.0	And so I'm just trying to.
3122900	3123650	388	B	0.9981	From.
3124100	3148296	389	C	0.93	Yeah, I don't know, from just generally building up simulations, which are just things that you can put together in a browser, like with simple JavaScript to Cadcad and active block prints and these sorts of things and trying to grasp at some real world situation.
3148398	3166344	390	C	0.88912	So maybe that rat Tmaze is a really good place to focus on for me, like a good intersection between the book and something that isn't like the frog jumping or is it not jumping is so contrived.
3166392	3177328	391	C	0.94052	It's really difficult to think about modeling that and in a way that would help explain what's going it's like, yes, I knew the frog was jumping or not jumping, so that doesn't really help.
3177414	3178096	392	C	0.98	Right.
3178278	3192150	393	C	0.89659	Whereas the rat maybe coming up with some left or right hidden state based on the queue that's partially there's some explanatory power there that may be realized, I think.
3194200	3195190	394	C	0.99	I don't know.
3196440	3204680	395	C	0.50926	I'm trying to bridge jump over the Grand Canyon of the philosophical conceptual okay, got it.
3204750	3206708	396	C	0.98884	But the math there's.
3206804	3207160	397	C	0.99	Okay.
3207230	3211630	398	C	0.79425	But there's a gap there for me, so I'm trying to pull them together.
3214160	3214572	399	D	0.99	Yeah.
3214626	3229120	400	D	1.0	I have a question related to calibration of those priors and among other things, is that ever explained as to how to go about doing that for any of these models?
3229460	3230210	401	A	1.0	Yes.
3230660	3243376	402	A	0.79785	So model based data analysis is going to describe all right, chapter seven describes just in our last minute.
3243408	3246064	403	A	0.99998	Chapter seven describes the discrete state models.
3246192	3248692	404	A	0.99998	Chapter eight describes continuous time models.
3248836	3254004	405	A	0.99989	Chapter nine describes using empirical data for model driven data analysis.
3254132	3255720	406	A	0.93194	Chapter ten is a summary.
3256060	3257610	407	A	1.0	The textbook is.
3259740	3261832	408	D	0.77	Yeah, we're excited towards.
3261886	3265960	409	A	1.0	The Grand Canyon, but I think, again, we have several months to unpack this together.
3266030	3268424	410	A	0.50897	So I hope that we can go quite far with this.
3268462	3274924	411	A	0.98554	So please stay engaged and add your questions and start building from both sides.
3274972	3282930	412	A	0.99995	Play with the code examples provided, break them and then start from the other side with a recipe on a situation that you care about, and then they're going to meet in the middle.
3284740	3286850	413	A	1.0	Okay, thank you, everyone.
3288180	3289040	414	A	0.89716	Farewell.
3292500	3293344	415	D	0.78985	Bye, everyone.
3293462	3293740	416	A	0.98999	Bye.
