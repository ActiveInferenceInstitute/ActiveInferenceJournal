00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,430
You're okay. Hello. It's September 16.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,094
We're in Cohort, one of the

3
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,920
active textbook group. It's meeting 15,

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,686
or I guess yes, no, 16 on

5
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:20,026
let me just update the title meeting

6
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,174
16. We're in our second discussion on

7
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:25,640
chapter six. So are there any any

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,166
overall comments that people would like

9
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:34,502
to address about chapter six or

10
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,934
any other questions or points to add or

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:38,986
just areas of chapter six that they

12
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:40,140
found to be interesting.

13
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,514
Distinction between the interceptive

14
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:11,570
extraceptive modalities

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,740
which have been mentioned in box 6.1.

16
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,194
And I think

17
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,826
Kristen with Michael Allen,

18
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:28,678
if I'm not mistaken, has published a

19
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:30,280
recent paper just today,

20
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,206
exactly on that topic, in which they've

21
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:38,266
somehow tried to provide a

22
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:41,626
computational model for the first time

23
00:01:41,808 --> 00:01:44,294
for the unification of the interceptive

24
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:48,794
and extraceptive modalities. So since

25
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:52,734
this chapter is also the

26
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:56,558
modeling of those agents, I think this

27
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:00,086
paper, from in the Body's Eye

28
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,906
the computational anatomy of

29
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:05,730
interceptive inference might be relevant

30
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,418
for anyone who wants to model these

31
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:13,746
modalities with the aid of active

32
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:17,590
inference framework. Thank you.

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,960
Very nice. Thanks for sharing it.

34
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,360
Let's look at box 61.

35
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,930
As people see it, what distinguishes

36
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,254
exteriorceptive proprioceptive and

37
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,970
interoceptive modalities?

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,464
For example, why are proprioceptive and

39
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,480
interceptive separated?

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,288
Because I couldn't hear you. I don't

41
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:30,704
know if it's on my side or connection

42
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,276
was unstable from your side. Sorry. Let

43
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,688
me try something. I'll be on for a

44
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:36,250
second.

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,724
Am I back? Okay. So,

46
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:53,708
yeah. What? Yeah, brock, I do need a

47
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:57,756
starlink. Why are proprioception

48
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,760
and terraception separated?

49
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,600
And why are these three categories

50
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,416
modeled as different? Why have they been

51
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,490
framed as different.

52
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,372
Biological and neurological mechanisms,

53
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:40,180
neural mechanisms that somehow

54
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,484
control those different kind of

55
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:47,524
perceptions? Because for the

56
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,380
extraceptive perception,

57
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,936
the organism would

58
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:00,360
necessarily need a kind of sensory

59
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,956
I mean, the sensation it gets

60
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:09,436
from the environment is just on

61
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,532
the level of the

62
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,344
imminent stimuli that it gets from the

63
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,384
external environment. But for the

64
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,200
interceptive modality,

65
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,440
the sensation is just the internal

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,708
sensations and so on. And for the

67
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:34,816
preceptive, it's related to motor

68
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:39,156
control feedback loop. So I

69
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:42,090
guess because of their different

70
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,264
mechanisms it might be

71
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:50,536
helpful to talk in different terms

72
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:54,264
about each of them. But I'm not totally

73
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,470
sure about that.

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,236
I agree. I think one aspect, even in a

75
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:07,084
pre blanket or non blanket modality is

76
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:08,844
like they're about external things

77
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,456
versus about internal things. And then

78
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,760
between proprioception and

79
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,616
interoception, you're absolutely right

80
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,780
that they have different neural

81
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,020
mechanisms and physiological mechanisms

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,636
with some blurry space,

83
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:32,576
perhaps. For example, like interoception

84
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,496
about blood pressure is somewhere in

85
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:38,984
between, like a muscular reflex and an

86
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,464
organ reflex, but the tissues being

87
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,712
addressed are different. Let's look at

88
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:48,348
this paper again. We'll return to the

89
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,124
book, but we're going to be thinking

90
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,428
today and then especially going forward

91
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:56,860
with like, how do you identify

92
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,136
the let's go

93
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:03,936
to this question, which we just look at

94
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,200
it. Which system are we modeling?

95
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,968
What is the appropriate form for the

96
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:12,428
generative model. How do we set up a

97
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:14,548
generative model? How do we set up a

98
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:17,588
generative process? So let's see if we

99
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:20,340
can determine some of those aspects.

100
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,630
In this paper,

101
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,574
hashtag figure 43, it is the very

102
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:32,200
same.

103
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,766
Okay, this is just a general pointing to

104
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,294
a partially observable Markov decision

105
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:43,754
process with a slight plus

106
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:47,494
computational biology graphical veneer

107
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,994
to match the color scheme. Probably not,

108
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,920
but it kind of looks like it.

109
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,550
Here is where we see the schematic

110
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,820
of the form of the generative model.

111
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,774
Variables are used to reflect

112
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,826
that those variables can be fit from

113
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:16,646
empirical data or just a priori set and

114
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:19,414
simulated. But this is the form of the

115
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,926
model. These are the shapes of the

116
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:26,262
matrices and tensors that go

117
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,900
from that are going to address

118
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,860
what their model is about.

119
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,650
Does anybody want to describe what they

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,060
see in this?

121
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,774
What do you think they were trying to

122
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:47,406
explain and what do

123
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,870
you think they were trying to model?

124
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,694
What is their system of interest based

125
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,280
upon what you see here?

126
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,114
Actually, one interesting term that I

127
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:05,554
came up with used in this

128
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:09,234
paper is cardiac

129
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,186
active inference. The term that they've

130
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:16,630
used in this paper to describe the

131
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,090
kind of interrelationship between the

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,874
heart rhythm and the

133
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:28,022
interception. So this generative

134
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:31,454
model, I believe, is just

135
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:35,726
about modeling that relationship between

136
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,530
the heart rhythm and the interception.

137
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,114
So we can see, as usual,

138
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,034
the B matrices C and A matrices that

139
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:49,874
we've seen before, but in this case,

140
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:54,766
they've been applied to the variation

141
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:58,082
in the heart rhythm and how it relates

142
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:01,960
to the interception. Yes.

143
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,742
So again, using the variables that

144
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:09,238
we know from figure four three in the

145
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:11,866
book and their figure one here, the

146
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:14,730
hidden states that are not directly

147
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,794
observed are on the

148
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:21,614
interceptive side relating to the state

149
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:25,194
of the heart. On the exteriorceptive

150
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:28,766
side, whether there is a flower or a

151
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:29,470
spider.

152
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,050
The outcomes that are observed are the

153
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,058
visual exterocception of a flower or a

154
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:42,946
spider and the heart rate probably

155
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,300
a low and a high heart rate.

156
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,046
The piece that links these two is the

157
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,886
sensory attenuation between

158
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,454
the high heart rate state and the

159
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:03,946
mapping of exterocception in

160
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,938
the B matrix. You can just see that even

161
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:09,546
the allocation of the symbols is

162
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,630
different. Like when you're aroused,

163
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,078
when you're in, this is like heart open

164
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:21,326
and then heart contract. So when

165
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,026
you're in the aroused situation, b is

166
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,980
how the hidden states change their time.

167
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,042
You're always going to go from here to

168
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:31,700
here,

169
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,680
whereas in the relaxed situation,

170
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,270
sometimes you go from

171
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,360
this state to this one.

172
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,354
Other times you're relaxed and so you

173
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:53,206
dwell within that state. So here it's

174
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:57,180
like pump rest, pump rest, pump rest.

175
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,478
Here it's 50% slower. Just it depends

176
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,930
on the parameters, but it's 50% slower

177
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,422
because sometimes you're going to go

178
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,678
from one, but it looks like as it's here

179
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:12,046
that it's actually like or it's twice as

180
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:15,086
slow. Rest, rest, beat.

181
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,386
Rest, rest, beat. So these are the two

182
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,020
interoceptive states.

183
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,334
One has a preference for having

184
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:29,720
relaxed hearts when flowers are around

185
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,946
and having contracted heart when spiders

186
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,594
are around. The A matrix

187
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,770
maps on these two sensory modalities

188
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,814
between hidden states and outcome

189
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:47,514
states, just like any A matrix would

190
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:50,966
do in any POMDP. And then

191
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:54,926
there's also a transition matrix of the

192
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:58,206
generative process. So it's a very

193
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:00,302
simple generative process where either

194
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:03,326
flowers are flowers or spiders are

195
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:04,270
spiders,

196
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,010
as they would say. You can use standard

197
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,646
routines to simulate these techniques.

198
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,540
I hope that the code are available.

199
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,610
You can plot parameter sweeps

200
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,050
as you explore the beta and alpha.

201
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,814
So here's, like the beta parameter and

202
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:29,414
alpha parameter. So you can do parameter

203
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:32,074
sweeps with this grid search or other

204
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:35,546
approaches and then do statistics on

205
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,358
those outputs. Is this quote active

206
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:41,066
inference? Well, it's the output of a

207
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,954
parameter sweep on an active inference

208
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:46,206
model. There's various other kinds of

209
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,926
methods. So, not to spend too much time

210
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:52,366
on the paper, but does

211
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:56,180
anyone have any thoughts on that case

212
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,686
or how they see it applying to chapter

213
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:01,780
six as content?

214
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,388
I think it speaks to a fulfillment cycle

215
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,570
in active inference research.

216
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,290
Oh.

217
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,890
This worked example helps a lot.

218
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,770
I mean, if anyone wants to,

219
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,272
especially because describing

220
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,630
this kind of cardiac active inference as

221
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,816
a kind of system that has

222
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:13,400
a definite Markov blanket, it was

223
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,800
really interesting question at the first

224
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,970
place. And I think they've done really

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,324
great job, obviously, in that regard and

226
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,268
thinking really creatively and out of

227
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,484
the box about how we

228
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:35,472
can describe that whole system with

229
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:39,504
the aid of using markup blankets to

230
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,644
describe its internal and external

231
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,330
environment and so on.

232
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,104
It also relates to this earlier

233
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:52,436
question. So how does the figure 43

234
00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:56,324
paradigm discrete and

235
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:59,350
continuous state spaces with all the

236
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,216
attending complexities? Do you hear me,

237
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:05,610
Ollie? Okay,

238
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,360
how does this representation connect

239
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,560
to. Can you hear,

240
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,110
Daniel? Yeah, I can.

241
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,116
It's a story for another day. Some of

242
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:26,124
the incredible, the truly incredible

243
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,544
Internet. I'm going to try one thing.

244
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:31,136
So I think that or Holly, can. You hear

245
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,130
me now? Or no.

246
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,910
I'll try something.

247
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,038
It here's what's interesting with the Wi

248
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,994
Fi. And then we'll continue, because

249
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,390
it's not a Wi Fi learning group, but

250
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,486
with the Hotspot, there are a set of

251
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,640
people who I cannot interact with,

252
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,106
but with WiFi, I am able to interact

253
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,698
with those people. Just a

254
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:25,554
note. So we

255
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,970
see the POMDP representation.

256
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,420
Now, what is not in this paper

257
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,904
here is a graphical layout of

258
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:43,280
the POMDP.

259
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,336
Okay? What is not in this paper? A

260
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,348
figure six one, or indeed a figure

261
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:53,780
eleven representation.

262
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:03,750
So why is that's?

263
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,298
I'm not sure I've understood your

264
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:17,294
question quite clearly, but could

265
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:19,054
you please elaborate on that a little

266
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:22,014
bit more? Yes, sure. So when we look at

267
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,742
papers like Vassal at all,

268
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,594
communication is active inference

269
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:27,818
social, inactive, active inference,

270
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:30,802
loops, loops, loops, viotkin at all

271
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,570
remote teams. Loops, loops, loops,

272
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,550
Markov blanket interface loops,

273
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,140
entities, things.

274
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,080
Yet in the application,

275
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,350
what is specified is not the loopy

276
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,298
situation. What needs to be specified is

277
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:57,260
chapter six, not chapter one.

278
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,530
So I find that very interesting because

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,330
so much of the focus attention,

280
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,994
discourse has been around abstractions,

281
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:13,294
around Markov blankets and their

282
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:16,174
interpretations from various stances and

283
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:18,574
about boundaries, physical boundaries

284
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,450
and conceptual boundaries.

285
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,114
But it's a non controversy when

286
00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:31,838
it's written this way. And there

287
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:33,398
are Markov blankets between many of

288
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:35,986
these variables because it's a Bayesian

289
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,654
graph that's not fully connected. So

290
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,026
every Bayesian graph that's not fully

291
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,754
connected has Markov blankets.

292
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:44,938
Trivially. But this

293
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:49,146
paper doesn't need to

294
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:52,634
describe what

295
00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:55,194
is. This is enough to say what's inside

296
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,526
and outside the organismal. Markov

297
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,134
blanket, if we want to even think about

298
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:02,542
it, is like here in this line, kind of

299
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:06,160
not on the Bayes graph, but it's between

300
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,762
the spider and the flower outside and

301
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:12,290
the vision of the spider and the flower.

302
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,060
But that's like taken care of

303
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,586
with the a matrix of the exterocceptive

304
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:25,254
modality, which is,

305
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:30,774
I think, why this recipe does

306
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,938
not focus on which

307
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:38,842
thing are we modeling, but rather which

308
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:41,206
system are we modeling. And yes, we're

309
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:42,810
going to pursue the generative model

310
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,114
before the generative process, even

311
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:46,606
though they may have symmetry or they

312
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,680
may be very similar.

313
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,838
But I just find it very interesting,

314
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,240
open to hearing what people think, like

315
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,294
why the Cybernetic

316
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:02,850
loop action perception loop is

317
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,674
used so much in

318
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:12,182
contrast with the form of the model

319
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,230
that's actually implemented,

320
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,518
which is a different topology in a

321
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:19,670
different discussion.

322
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,446
I know that they're integrated and

323
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,310
compatible.

324
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,690
Just one comment on that is, you see,

325
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,184
at least to my understanding, markup

326
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:48,356
blanket is a

327
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:52,516
kind of modeling tool or a

328
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:55,770
way of thinking about basically

329
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,276
the ontology of I mean ontology

330
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:03,016
in the sense of its philosophical use,

331
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:06,120
the ontology of the system that we're

332
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,976
about to model. So it's

333
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:13,292
not necessarily the

334
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,708
relationships among the different

335
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,544
components of the markup blanket is

336
00:22:18,662 --> 00:22:22,588
something not necessarily physical

337
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:26,272
or tangible relationships in that

338
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:30,516
system. So it might be kind

339
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:33,220
of just informational,

340
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,516
as we

341
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:40,848
saw in, I think, chapter five, if I'm

342
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:43,636
not mistaken, the information passing

343
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:45,464
among the different components and so

344
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:48,712
on. So at least

345
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:53,130
I think the reason for not using the

346
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,396
Schematic model of markup I mean the

347
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,384
Cybernetic model of Markup blanket

348
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:02,392
instead of using just the Schematic

349
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:06,268
form, probably it's because of this

350
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:10,352
kind of, let's say

351
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:13,888
nonphysical or nontangible relationship

352
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:17,072
among the different components. By

353
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:20,450
nontangible and nonphysical I mean

354
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,820
something that can't be explained

355
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,640
in terms of its ontological

356
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,548
existence. I don't

357
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:36,616
know if I could express myself in

358
00:23:36,638 --> 00:23:38,650
that regard or not.

359
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,090
Thank you, Elite, Brock and anyone else.

360
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,996
I was just going to I

361
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:55,160
don't know, I feel like personally,

362
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,456
I'm just kind of at the

363
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:05,552
affordances that I have to get

364
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:07,552
pragmatic and epistemic value here

365
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,536
without doing some modeling of some

366
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:10,130
kind.

367
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,430
Yeah, I don't know. Good.

368
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,412
Thanks. I mean, this is the second

369
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:25,256
discussion on chapter six, and then this

370
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,256
is setting us up to actually pursue a

371
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,090
model. So we should be preparing these.

372
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah. I'm just saying it's definitely

373
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,370
ripe for that.

374
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,800
Yes. Rohan.

375
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,444
Yeah, actually, just to get some

376
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:48,844
clarification, you're asking why the

377
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:52,300
form of the model is as mentioned in

378
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,916
chapter six of the project given in

379
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,710
chapter six, which is chapter one.

380
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,432
Yes. I mean, they're compatible.

381
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:05,504
Topologies that actually are describing

382
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:08,260
an overlapping set of notes.

383
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,290
I was just calling attention to the

384
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,704
amount of discourse and focus on the

385
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,552
potentially more familiar, more

386
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:25,484
schematic action perception loop and

387
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,244
the way that that draws so much

388
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:29,512
attention to the organism environment

389
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:33,164
interface. Whereas when it comes

390
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:34,940
to the empirical modeling,

391
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,116
that interface never had to be specified

392
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:43,090
as like a first class type.

393
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,776
It just was included by the buy. We just

394
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,456
said there are spiders and flowers out

395
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:52,804
there, hidden states, s, and then

396
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,972
there's observations of and there's no

397
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:59,524
error. There's no

398
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:02,464
error. Right. But there would be no

399
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,128
error in the generative process itself.

400
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:13,656
The model might have error that

401
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:15,772
comes from some measurement issue.

402
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:19,420
Right? So when you measure it and you

403
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,764
confuse, say, spider for flower or

404
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:25,164
flower for spider, then you would get

405
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:27,096
some error. And there may be that's

406
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,956
where I guess you can talk about the

407
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:32,436
markup blanket misspecifying

408
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:34,530
or misobserving something.

409
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,024
So I'm not sure what

410
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:42,976
exactly is. The. I mean,

411
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:46,484
they're compatible, right? In this case,

412
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,644
there's no error. But if there was

413
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:50,516
error, obviously there would be

414
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,790
something wrong with the.

415
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,336
Let me actually just correct this. I

416
00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:00,904
believe be I didn't mean to say

417
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:02,744
this is the visual error. This is saying

418
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:05,332
that they're unchanging flowers, so

419
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,788
they're either one or the other. Here.

420
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,564
Parametrically it's possible to

421
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:12,220
introduce visual error in the A matrix.

422
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,740
But I'm just pointing to the

423
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,764
architecture of the model doesn't

424
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:21,730
require even engaging with this.

425
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,856
It's totally compatible. And the

426
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,408
observations are the sense states and

427
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,216
the actions are the active states and so

428
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:33,408
on, but as presented

429
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,380
and as constructed,

430
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,976
if we're going to use a POMDP

431
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:42,164
architecture, we don't necessarily even

432
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,010
need a representation like this.

433
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,032
Yeah. Jessica okay,

434
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:54,010
that's interesting.

435
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,612
Hi. Yes. For me,

436
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:05,176
the reason why it's

437
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,584
like two parts, the reason why the craft

438
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:11,116
is so popular, and I think maybe it's

439
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:14,096
also the reason why it was used.

440
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:16,976
And this is the simplicity to show the

441
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:19,936
concept and the relationship like the

442
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:23,008
new one. It's great for, I guess, for

443
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:25,284
the paper that it was created, but it

444
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:27,908
doesn't show the relationship as clear

445
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:30,596
as the other ones. It's very simple. So

446
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:33,444
I think that's why it was used. Maybe

447
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:36,056
like, remove a lot of extra information

448
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:40,136
that the second paper illustrates in

449
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:43,480
it. But the simplicity of that graph is

450
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,740
why it really encapsulates the concept.

451
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,636
And it's also the reason why it's so

452
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:51,324
popular, because it's so simple. I think

453
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,030
that's the relationship, I think,

454
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,750
from how I see it.

455
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,330
Yes, totally makes sense. Thank you.

456
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,520
And once we see that there is a mapping

457
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,290
from the Schematic cybernetic view,

458
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,016
then we can probably fill in a lot of

459
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,164
the parts of the PMDP. But just to look

460
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:17,124
one more level here, I posted the code

461
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:21,220
below, so it's in MATLAB

462
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,172
which people may or may not have access

463
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:26,840
to. Sorry. Okay. Ali and then Ron.

464
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,064
No, I just wanted to point out one thing

465
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:35,290
that I forgot to mention before.

466
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,644
One thing that might be helpful to keep

467
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:42,044
in mind is that actually, in this

468
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,908
generative model, there is a kind of

469
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:48,732
unification, or kind of integration of

470
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,836
interceptive and extraceptive

471
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:53,824
modalities. Because, as they pointed out

472
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:54,770
in the paper,

473
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,428
this agent that they're modeling adopts

474
00:30:02,604 --> 00:30:05,604
two modes of engagement with the world,

475
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,588
one of which is the relaxed and the

476
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:11,072
other one is the aroused

477
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:13,972
mode of engagement. And because of that,

478
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,616
there are two sorts of hidden states

479
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:18,376
related to each interceptive and

480
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,776
extraceptive one. So I guess if

481
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:26,490
they wanted to put that kind of

482
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,964
interrelationships between these kind of

483
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:33,288
modalities in that simplified

484
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,888
schematic model, it wouldn't necessarily

485
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:39,672
clarify these kind of integration

486
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:43,072
between the modalities. So one reason

487
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:48,876
might be related to that peculiar

488
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:52,290
situation of this particular case here.

489
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,356
Thanks. It also speaks to the step in

490
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,992
the model of the form of a generative

491
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,396
model. And then I think when people get

492
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,848
married to the cybernetic scheme,

493
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:06,676
you can imagine, well, then there's two

494
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,372
nodes inside of the internal states.

495
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:10,040
There's two modes you can go between.

496
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,164
But now you're like, mixing and matching

497
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:14,568
what arrows mean, where some of the

498
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:16,644
arrows are reflecting causal influence

499
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,176
and some of them are reflecting

500
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,104
transitions between mutually exclusive

501
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:22,924
states. And so then we end up back into

502
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:26,604
the wireframe nightmare, where it's like

503
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:29,756
a schematic, where some edges are

504
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:31,756
tactile connections and some are causal

505
00:31:31,788 --> 00:31:33,484
links and some are mutually exclusive

506
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:35,216
transfers of information and all these

507
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:38,188
other ways that people visualize models.

508
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:41,056
And this representation reminds us that

509
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,892
we're dealing with variables and states

510
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:46,580
and their connections. Jessica.

511
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,530
I think that was from before. Okay.

512
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,084
I think the visual has

513
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:03,016
to do with what are you trying to convey

514
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,376
in that moment and how much depth

515
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:08,844
of information do you need? I think,

516
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:10,828
like, at least for this one, you need an

517
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,512
extra information so that all the model

518
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,530
wouldn't work. Well,

519
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,016
just share with the idea of what the

520
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:21,968
model is. Maybe this version with

521
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,376
the extra information might be too

522
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:25,568
complex for the other one. There's a

523
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:27,856
better purpose. What is the purpose

524
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:30,896
you're trying to accomplish,

525
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:32,960
and what do you want to communicate?

526
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,296
And depending on that, then models with

527
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:38,504
more information or less information are

528
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,912
more successful. Yes.

529
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:44,072
Thank you. Totally agree. I mean, they

530
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:47,016
didn't do any of the loop at all. They

531
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,064
just went straight to the PMDP

532
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:51,724
representation. And also, this isn't the

533
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,184
only form of an interoceptive

534
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:57,292
exterocceptive integration model. One

535
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:59,676
could brainstorm a whole host. And

536
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:01,632
again, that's what the recipe is for.

537
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:03,804
Well, we could have a mutually exclusive

538
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:06,528
transfer between these two states

539
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:08,960
defined by these two B matrices,

540
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,664
which entails a policy variable

541
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:15,316
switching between the two. Or we could

542
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:17,076
have a continuous variable called

543
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,324
arousal. And arousal is engaged in some

544
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:22,756
sort of attenuation relationship here.

545
00:33:22,938 --> 00:33:26,056
So this isn't even the only form, but it

546
00:33:26,078 --> 00:33:27,450
shows us a form.

547
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,450
Okay,

548
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,936
soon, in 20 minutes, we're going to be

549
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,504
heading into chapter seven. So let's

550
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:44,808
preview it so that when we're

551
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:46,750
working on this in the next week,

552
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,516
preparing our questions, starting to

553
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:51,980
think about what we want to be modeling,

554
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,536
we'll kind of know what's going to

555
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:56,880
happen. All right, chapter seven is

556
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,624
active inference in discrete time.

557
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,256
People can still hear me okay. I think

558
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:04,052
so. All right, so here

559
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:07,460
is where we cross the rubicon

560
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,220
with modeling.

561
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,520
This is abstract up till now.

562
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,020
You cut out there for a second. Okay.

563
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,522
It's all good now. Yeah.

564
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:25,002
Just start from the review. Thank you.

565
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:26,778
Chapter seven, we're crossing the

566
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:29,100
rubicon together,

567
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,280
and it's been abstract up till now.

568
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,154
First, what is addressed is perceptual

569
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,734
processing. You'll find a lot of

570
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:44,174
resonance between this chapter

571
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:47,954
seven and Step

572
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:48,740
by Step,

573
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,918
which is model stream one. Maybe it's

574
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,090
Stephen.

575
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,694
This paper step by step tutorial is

576
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:06,802
going to do a certain walkthrough of

577
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:09,338
adding incremental complexity into the

578
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:12,118
model in terms of model parameter depth.

579
00:35:12,214 --> 00:35:14,406
Okay. It's model stream one. There's

580
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:16,442
four streams that Ryan and Chris White

581
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:19,290
did. Static perception,

582
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,434
dynamic perception, dynamic perception

583
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:25,182
with preferences and free energy

584
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:28,334
minimization. Dynamic perception with

585
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:30,922
free energy minimization and flexible

586
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:32,766
policy selection through uncertainty

587
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,842
modulation. We're going to do something

588
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,780
similar in chapter seven.

589
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,762
They don't do that upper left

590
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,774
corner of step by step. They go straight

591
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:47,794
to hidden Markov models for dynamic

592
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:50,566
perception. This is analogous to a

593
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:53,286
Coleman filter or any other number of

594
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:55,686
General Bayesian filtering schemes. We

595
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:59,946
have a prior D hidden states S and

596
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:02,202
a sequence of observables through time T

597
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:04,762
that are mapped to hidden states. A B

598
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,154
describes how hidden states change

599
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:08,774
through time. So we have the temperature

600
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,686
is a hidden variable. And then we're

601
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,166
getting observations from the

602
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:15,854
thermometer that are mapped to the real

603
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:17,358
temperature by A. Maybe it's a good

604
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:18,926
thermometer, maybe it's biased or

605
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:20,478
whatever. And then there's the

606
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,000
temperature changing through time.

607
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,678
Then there's a very Ollie Centric

608
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:31,234
discussion of listening to music. This

609
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,598
has to be one of the most glaring errors

610
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:34,870
in the textbook.

611
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,734
It's very warhol like, though, so maybe

612
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:42,440
it has a certain aesthetic to it.

613
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,254
But the example that's going to be

614
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:47,254
provided is like a musical listening

615
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:51,820
example. So the

616
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,250
A matrix is emitting notes

617
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,406
based upon the hidden state, which is

618
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:04,170
the score of the music. The B matrix

619
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,014
is and they have 70% accuracy. So this

620
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,590
one 10th distributes through the matrix.

621
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,906
So it's just to use, like, integers

622
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:15,410
here. But really this is like zero 7.1.1

623
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,946
.1, because it has to add up to one.

624
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:22,046
But when this person, when the hidden

625
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:25,406
state of the score is in the first note,

626
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:27,506
they play it 70% of the time. And then

627
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:29,046
the other three notes, they make an

628
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:32,518
error 10% of the time. Each time, 70% of

629
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:34,402
the time, the musician hits their note.

630
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,502
The B matrix is how things change

631
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:37,970
through time, the hidden state. So this

632
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,082
is the transitions in the score. And

633
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:44,314
here there's a 97% probability. Again,

634
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:46,266
it's distributed throughout with this

635
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:48,346
one over 100 just to represent it with

636
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:52,062
integers. And there's a prior with no

637
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,254
uncertainty or ambiguity of just it

638
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:58,366
begins in the first position. And so

639
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:03,006
this we can even see, like do do you

640
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,818
know, I don't want to use ABCD, but it

641
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,526
would be like BCDA in the musical

642
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:12,914
ontology. So here's BCCDA like

643
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:16,310
that. But then there is an error

644
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,206
in this one simulation run. It'd be

645
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:20,726
probabilistic, but they're showing for

646
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:24,326
didactic reasons, a run where the third

647
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:28,154
point in the third observation, there is

648
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:31,754
an error. However, it's heard as

649
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:32,940
the correct value.

650
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,202
That's a pure inference example. This is

651
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:43,278
not active inference. This is just

652
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,790
Bayesian models of perception.

653
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,598
This kind of sessile creature is rather

654
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:56,740
uninteresting. Okay,

655
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,114
now we move from a hidden Markov model

656
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:04,386
crotching tiger, hidden Markov, into a

657
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,894
partially observable Markov decision

658
00:39:07,022 --> 00:39:10,246
process. A hidden Markov model is a

659
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:12,520
partially observable Markov model

660
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,674
because some parts of it are hidden,

661
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,966
some are not. But the key piece here is

662
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,754
the introduction of the decision. We

663
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,842
know that we model that with policy that

664
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:25,178
influences how states change their time,

665
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:28,682
and that policy selection is governed by

666
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:33,582
g. Figure four three people

667
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,374
can still hear because I see all these,

668
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:36,640
like, frozen for me.

669
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,766
Okay, all right. Okay, thank you. Yeah,

670
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:43,534
it's just strange stuff here's four

671
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:44,400
three again,

672
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,218
here when we're talking about policy

673
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:56,322
selection, we're talking about states

674
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,638
that haven't happened yet,

675
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:59,126
observations, and hidden states that

676
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,494
haven't happened yet. We see a

677
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,694
restatement of equation 2.6 with

678
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:07,462
expected free energy here, broken into

679
00:40:07,516 --> 00:40:09,480
epistemic and pragmatic value.

680
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,560
Now, to flesh out this POMDP,

681
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,132
we turn to a classic par and Friston

682
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:26,040
example, which is the teammase.

683
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,332
We're not going to go through every

684
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,310
single part of this teammase right now,

685
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,104
but it'll be a key area for us to

686
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:40,896
unpack. Why do the matrices have

687
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:42,530
the dimensions that they have?

688
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,120
Where are the four locations that the

689
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,810
mouse can be here,

690
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,364
down at the bottom, to the left or to

691
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:55,584
the right? So this is not like a mouse

692
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:57,364
moving in continuous space. It's like

693
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,204
there are four locations it can be in.

694
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:02,810
Those are the columns. There's five

695
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,184
hidden states of location which

696
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,288
we can see are like, based upon whether

697
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:14,696
when it goes down to the bottom to get

698
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:18,004
a queue, whether the hidden

699
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:20,156
state is going to reveal the queue or

700
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:23,564
not. And then figure seven,

701
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:26,828
four and 75 you'll see differ.

702
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:28,496
First off, one of them is bolded, this

703
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:31,360
one is bolded, this one's unbolded. But

704
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,492
here we see a one in the L column

705
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:37,584
because the black is on the L. And here

706
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:40,356
we see a one in the R column because the

707
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:43,924
black is on the R. So understanding why

708
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:47,412
that is is going to be the crux of

709
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:51,384
understanding how to construct an

710
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:54,952
epistemic informative q as

711
00:41:55,006 --> 00:41:58,136
a hidden environmental variable in a

712
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:01,096
generative model. Here are the B

713
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,620
matrices transition probabilities.

714
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,716
Here's the preference vector. We'll talk

715
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:11,756
about what C one and C two are. Here are

716
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,556
the priors we'll talk about what D one

717
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:19,056
and D two are. Now there's more

718
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:22,288
unpacking of the epistemic value

719
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,484
itself. So in the equation

720
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,796
above there was a restatement of

721
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:30,596
equation 2.6 which partitions the

722
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:32,624
expected free energy into the negative

723
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:35,030
epistemic value and the pragmatic value.

724
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,676
Now we're going to follow up on the

725
00:42:38,698 --> 00:42:42,808
epistemic value I

726
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,410
of pi the epistemic value of a policy

727
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,568
and break that down into these

728
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:55,880
representations.

729
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,830
Here are simulations,

730
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,994
simulated epistemic and pragmatic

731
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,646
behavior of a rat foraging in a

732
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,766
teammates. So we'll try

733
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,298
to model what these runs are. I think it

734
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:14,122
might be one small note about the book

735
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,026
that especially if they knew that it was

736
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:18,474
going to be black and white, which it

737
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,730
seems like that was known,

738
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,010
this is not ultra helpful.

739
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,162
Perhaps people disagree. But another

740
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:35,734
war. What said

741
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:39,240
another warhol? Yeah,

742
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,746
this one you can even see the Campbell

743
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:45,686
soup. But I think

744
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,582
if someone were familiar with reading

745
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,626
these traces, they would still want

746
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,494
to understand what these different lines

747
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:57,420
were and like what the dashed one is.

748
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,306
But if people are unfamiliar reading

749
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:02,750
these kinds of error residual traces,

750
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,200
I don't know what is being shown here

751
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,958
figure 7.7. That was the simulation

752
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,726
of the rat getting the epistemic queue

753
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,226
and going to the left. So instead of

754
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:25,686
just taking a 50 50 shot on where the

755
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:29,254
food was, the rat navigates this

756
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,846
explore exploit dilemma. It engages in

757
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:34,566
an epistemically oriented action or an

758
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,638
action driven by epistemic value to

759
00:44:37,724 --> 00:44:40,826
reduce uncertainty, get the queue and

760
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,460
then it secures the food.

761
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,074
In this box 71 we see

762
00:44:48,112 --> 00:44:51,118
a discussion about parameterization of

763
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:54,798
uncertainty and how precision is

764
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:58,670
the inverse of variance. And this omega

765
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,080
is the precision variable here,

766
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,050
just like Mark Solms uses, but others

767
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,540
use different ones.

768
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,220
The lower this value is,

769
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,520
the more even things are.

770
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,754
And so this has come up in the ice cream

771
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,494
example with the folk psychology live

772
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:26,850
stream. Like if your c vector

773
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:33,206
is zero

774
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:36,930
six negative six versus

775
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,886
zero 500 negative 500, that's like

776
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:43,930
a sharper preference distribution.

777
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,706
So it's the quantitative values in the

778
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:51,306
C, for example, that specified not

779
00:45:51,328 --> 00:45:52,666
just the direction but also the

780
00:45:52,688 --> 00:45:54,766
intensity of preference. And then

781
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:58,458
analogously precision can be specified

782
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:02,382
in a continuous form. Here is

783
00:46:02,436 --> 00:46:04,158
a reference to an earlier par and

784
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:07,506
Friston work on vision that has to

785
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:10,690
do with ocular motor foraging, which is

786
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,020
heavily epistemically driven. But then

787
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,402
they are using this example to

788
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:22,306
explore how precision the

789
00:46:22,328 --> 00:46:24,102
viewer shows a version to the upper left

790
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,150
square when it is specified with a less

791
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,994
precise, more ambiguous likelihood.

792
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:32,522
Mapping the lower left square

793
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:33,978
is epistemically attractive when the

794
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:35,782
transition probabilities are specified

795
00:46:35,846 --> 00:46:37,210
as more uncertain.

796
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,310
We'll try to understand these examples.

797
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:51,194
Learning a Novelty 7.5 here

798
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:54,806
we take that POMDP and we push

799
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,566
it back in the genealogy. Now we

800
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:03,006
have priors on the hidden states which

801
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,554
are themselves equipped with prior

802
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:07,274
beliefs. These are dear Schlee conjugate

803
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:11,050
priors, but they can be of other forms.

804
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,926
But they're just shown as dear Schlee

805
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,550
here because it's like a convenient

806
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,242
statistical distribution family for

807
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:20,334
variational inference which we explored

808
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,020
in several chapters ago.

809
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,990
These can be considered as hyper priors,

810
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,246
but in the end just variables on the

811
00:47:30,268 --> 00:47:33,026
graph. And it's not like they're tagged

812
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,646
with being a hyper prior and you can

813
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,000
imagine priors that nest on them.

814
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,062
Exploring these potentially open ended

815
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:43,226
Bayesian graph structures is why it's so

816
00:47:43,248 --> 00:47:45,020
important to have structure learning,

817
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,850
like Karl has pointed out for years,

818
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,082
and why we want to have parameter sweeps

819
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:54,254
across cognitive model structures in

820
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,878
active block prints. Because why stop?

821
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:00,080
Why not have another prior on this one?

822
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,866
So we should have the notation and the

823
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:04,500
capacity to sweep that.

824
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,246
Here is a discussion on conjugate

825
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:13,762
priors. A conjugate prior means

826
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:15,326
that when used to perform Bayesian

827
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:16,978
inference, the posterior belief will be

828
00:48:16,984 --> 00:48:19,094
the same type of distribution. So

829
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:20,806
previously we talked about how like the

830
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:22,274
hidden state could be a continuous

831
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:24,438
variable and then the internal state

832
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:27,382
could be like a discrete variable. The

833
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:29,626
temperature is continuous outside and

834
00:48:29,648 --> 00:48:32,026
then inside is it hot or is it cold? Is

835
00:48:32,048 --> 00:48:34,906
like what I'm caring about. So the

836
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:38,570
families don't have to match. But when

837
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,334
we use conjugate priors it

838
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:46,046
makes it so that where you

839
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:48,974
can design it to play nice. It does play

840
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:53,362
nice, but we'll work through that also

841
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:54,914
with anybody who wants to go into more

842
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:57,266
detail on the math because these are

843
00:48:57,288 --> 00:49:00,820
just like Bayesian statistics points.

844
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,842
Here theta is used to just describe

845
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:07,842
parameters. It's a very common notation,

846
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:10,806
but not 100% pervasive to use theta for

847
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:14,918
parameters, just generally here

848
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:17,446
there's more unpacking of the update

849
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:19,414
rules. This is probably of secondary

850
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:21,466
consideration for just constructing a

851
00:49:21,488 --> 00:49:22,060
model.

852
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,540
Here we return to expected free energy

853
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,314
and several more representations beyond

854
00:49:33,362 --> 00:49:34,806
what was seen above and beyond what was

855
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:36,520
seen in equation 2.6.

856
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,486
Here the learning model that was

857
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:43,490
presented above the POMDP with another

858
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,806
generation of genealogy is described

859
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:49,130
which is drawn from these two papers.

860
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,930
Then structured learning is introduced.

861
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,414
We'll see how deep this one goes. But

862
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,374
these papers are quite interesting and

863
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:01,310
connected to Bayesian model reduction.

864
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,950
Here a hierarchical model is presented

865
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,600
here's figure 43 in the dashed box.

866
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,146
Now there's a figure 43 yo dog. I heard

867
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:15,620
you liked figure four, three.

868
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,602
Then there's another hierarchical

869
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,978
model simulation from the above showing

870
00:50:24,994 --> 00:50:26,930
belief updating again with these trace

871
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,070
diagrams.

872
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,430
And then there's a summary.

873
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:40,170
So it's a somewhat long chapter.

874
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,578
It contains like, the music example,

875
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:45,180
the rat example,

876
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,000
the maze example, the eye example.

877
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,534
So we're seeing like, data points in

878
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:55,950
model space, um,

879
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,402
in the last three minutes. Does anyone

880
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:04,226
have any thoughts or questions? How are

881
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:06,100
they going to tackle chapter seven?

882
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,666
And as they start to construct their

883
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:11,380
model, if they want to?

884
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:25,420
I am just every

885
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,030
direction that I can because it is

886
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,356
quite dense still and kind of

887
00:51:32,378 --> 00:51:35,024
unapproachable, I think, for me anyways,

888
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:37,808
it just is quite difficult to get a

889
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:41,476
grasp on it from the textbook

890
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:44,872
specifically at this point,

891
00:51:44,926 --> 00:51:46,456
like the generative model, like, what

892
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,616
does that mean in code? And where does

893
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,420
that correlate to this particular

894
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,828
function or that particular time step or

895
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:56,076
whatever? I don't know.

896
00:51:56,098 --> 00:51:59,228
It's just a lot. And so I'm just trying

897
00:51:59,314 --> 00:51:59,950
to.

898
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,130
From. Yeah, I don't know, from just

899
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,748
generally building up simulations,

900
00:52:10,844 --> 00:52:14,144
which are just things that you can put

901
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:16,932
together in a browser, like with simple

902
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:20,608
JavaScript to Cadcad and active

903
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:22,996
block prints and these sorts of things

904
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,736
and trying to grasp

905
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,272
at some real world situation. So maybe

906
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:33,384
that rat Tmaze is a really good

907
00:52:33,502 --> 00:52:37,384
place to focus on for me, like a good

908
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:39,384
intersection between the book and

909
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:42,184
something that isn't like the frog

910
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:45,804
jumping or is it not jumping is so

911
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:47,884
contrived. It's really difficult to

912
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:50,364
think about modeling that and in a way

913
00:52:50,402 --> 00:52:52,716
that would help explain what's going

914
00:52:52,738 --> 00:52:54,496
it's like, yes, I knew the frog was

915
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,716
jumping or not jumping, so that doesn't

916
00:52:56,748 --> 00:53:00,348
really help. Right. Whereas the rat

917
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:03,360
maybe coming up with some left or right

918
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,256
hidden state based on the queue that's

919
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:10,164
partially there's some explanatory power

920
00:53:10,202 --> 00:53:12,150
there that may be realized, I think.

921
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,888
I don't know. I'm trying to

922
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:21,224
bridge jump over the Grand Canyon of the

923
00:53:21,342 --> 00:53:24,680
philosophical conceptual okay, got it.

924
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,956
But the math there's. Okay. But there's

925
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:30,716
a gap there for me, so I'm trying to

926
00:53:30,738 --> 00:53:31,630
pull them together.

927
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,604
Yeah. I have a question related to

928
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:38,936
calibration of those priors and among

929
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:43,092
other things, is that ever explained

930
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:46,770
as to how to go about doing that for

931
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,210
any of these models? Yes.

932
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,160
So model based data

933
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:59,808
analysis is going to describe all

934
00:53:59,814 --> 00:54:02,836
right, chapter seven describes just in

935
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:04,448
our last minute. Chapter seven describes

936
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:06,804
the discrete state models. Chapter eight

937
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:08,692
describes continuous time models.

938
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:11,412
Chapter nine describes using empirical

939
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:14,004
data for model driven data analysis.

940
00:54:14,132 --> 00:54:16,900
Chapter ten is a summary. The textbook

941
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,396
is. Yeah, we're excited

942
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,304
towards. The Grand Canyon, but I think,

943
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:25,364
again, we have several months to unpack

944
00:54:25,412 --> 00:54:27,480
this together. So I hope that we can go

945
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,552
quite far with this. So please stay

946
00:54:30,686 --> 00:54:33,664
engaged and add your questions and start

947
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:35,408
building from both sides. Play with the

948
00:54:35,414 --> 00:54:38,016
code examples provided, break them and

949
00:54:38,038 --> 00:54:39,456
then start from the other side with a

950
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:41,104
recipe on a situation that you care

951
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:42,288
about, and then they're going to meet in

952
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:45,536
the middle. Okay,

953
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:49,040
thank you, everyone. Farewell.

954
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,344
Bye, everyone.
