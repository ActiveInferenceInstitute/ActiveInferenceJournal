5850	168080	00:05	This module explores the concept of active inference and its relevance to social norms and human decision making. This framework has significant implications for understanding social behavior. It can help explain how individuals conform to social norm and make decisions based on the expectations of others. Together, these insights will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between active inference, social norms, and human decisions making.	This module explores the concept of active inference and its relevance to social norms	
168710	478050	02:48	Inactivism is a philosophical stance that extends beyond traditional theories of cognition. It argues that cognition is a dynamic, real time, fluid, and contextual social action. The field of inactivism and social cognition is ripe for exploration.	Inactivism provides a complementary lens to understand dynamic and contextual nature of social cognition	Inactivism and Social Cognition
480570	658750	08:00	How does agency emerge? How do things self organize through their interaction with the environment? Why are they not fully determined? These diverse interpretations serve as intellectual bridges connecting the domains of philosophy, psychology, and computational neuroscience.	Agency is a complex construct that has been explored through a multitude of frameworks	The issue of Inactivism in agency
661670	1482450	11:01	Deep temporal models provide a computational framework that can model the complex time dependent patterns of behavior and cognition. They can be interpreted and integrated into deep reinforcement learning algorithms to develop socially aware navigation policies. This way, we can have a more comprehensive models that explains how individuals exercise agency in complex social landscapes.	Deep temporal models offer insights into how agency is exercised in dynamic social contexts	Deep temporal models and social cognition
1485390	2338474	24:45	Social norms and shared Bayesian expectations link our individual and collective decision making processes to the broader understanding of selfhood. These scripts, optimized through extended active inference, not only guide our social interaction, but also contribute to the shaping of that self.	Active inference allows us to model how we derive the sense of self	Social Scripts and the Cognitive Self
2338522	2565350	38:58	The ecological approach to active inference is a framework that understands the complexities of human communication across different scales. It explores how individuals contribute to the collective intelligence of a group or society by fostering a collaborative approach. Context, as we saw earlier, plays a crucial role in the activation of predictive inferences.

2567610	2782590	42:47	Deep temporal models enable us to explore the sequential dynamics of language processing. They can help us understand neural mechanisms like language comprehension. Computational models give us a multidimensional view of social cognition and agency.

2784530	2837260	46:24	So, for next class, I offer you an opportunity. You should pick a text from this session from the references that will be made available. Try to explain how it ties to the concepts that we explored today. If you have any questions, we can potentially take them now.

2838510	3126830	47:18	Identity is literally how you craft yourselfhood relative to the narratives that you're given. Ideology corresponds to a looser, let's say, weak script that allows you to shift the valence of certain values across certain norms. How does that have an impact on affordances?	Ideology can shift valence of certain values across certain norms	Where does ideology and identity fit?
3126900	3599828	52:06	Would you be open to attempting to map a social or personal narrative rather than another element in the literature? The hero's journey or another archetypal attractor. What is the social?	Michael wrote, would you be open to attempting to map social or personal narrative	Mapping the Hero's Journey
3599994	3827470	59:59	How should marginalized communities fortify themselves against the more skillful extractive cultures? You need to have a strong narrative that supports your capacity to increase your fitness landscape. Develop allyships with individuals from the larger group that adopt your message.

3831440	4055162	1:03:51	The notion of internal and external is only useful in relation to the measurement of a joint probability. These are illusory boundaries. Because they're not real, we can sort of issue essentialism. If a boundary can always be redrawn relative to some kind of observer, then everything is always observer relative.	Sometimes there's a connection between phenomenology and active inference	Interaction between internal and external phenomenology
4055216	4709740	1:07:35	For structuralist definitions to apply, you need a lot more than shared values. You need a clergy that maintains and diffuses the specific discourse underlying the ideology. If consciousness is the substrate, then everything is some degree of conscious. That's what the recent work helps clarify.	Donald Hoffman: You have a diversity of definitions of ideology	Ideology and the Political Left
4710690	4796582	1:18:30	There's no direct control in the active, generative models of action observations. Only indirectly can observations be changed. It brings so much and just so much, like, on the personal thought side. It's a pretty cool lecture.

4796636	4850370	1:19:56	The field of social sciences is ripe for this. There's so much that can be done right now. We can get towards a confluent time in research and science. Really looking forward to the discussion and hoping that people engage in this affordance.
