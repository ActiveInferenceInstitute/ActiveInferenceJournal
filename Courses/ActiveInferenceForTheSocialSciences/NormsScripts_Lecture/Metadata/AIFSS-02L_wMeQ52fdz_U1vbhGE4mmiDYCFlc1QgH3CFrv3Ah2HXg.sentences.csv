5850	6400	1	A	0.67517	You.
8450	9598	2	B	0.75905	Hello and welcome.
9684	12590	3	B	0.98593	It's September 20, 2023.
12740	25706	4	B	0.99815	We're at the Active Inference Institute in the course, active Inference for the social Sciences, and here with Mao Aberrassen, who will be presenting today on norm scripts and linguistics under active inference.
25738	27840	5	B	0.99948	So thank you, Mao, to you.
29090	29598	6	A	0.99975	Awesome.
29684	30406	7	A	0.99941	So, hi, everyone.
30468	38594	8	A	0.51962	In as last time, there was a presentation on semiotics and semantics.
38642	43820	9	A	1.0	I won't dig too far into linguistics, but I'll touch on it at the end of the course.
44750	48950	10	A	0.99522	So what are we going to do in this module?
49030	55798	11	A	0.99868	We're going to explore the concept of active inference and its relevance to social norms and human decision making.
55984	70034	12	A	0.6588	As you will have seen in the previous classes, active inference is a theoretical framework that seeks to explain how organisms, including humans, engage with their environment to minimize uncertainty and maintain their internal states.
70152	78014	13	A	0.84424	We're not going to dig into these concepts too, too much, because I assume they have been previously explained.
78062	82786	14	A	1.0	At length, however, I will explain how they connect to social phenomena.
82978	95340	15	A	0.99992	So this framework has significant implications for understanding social behavior, as it can help explain how individuals conform to social norms and make decisions based on the expectations of others.
95870	110880	16	A	0.59862	We'll delve into the role of active inference in human societies, emphasizing how humans and other organisms constantly seek to minimize their uncertainty about the world by updating their beliefs and taking actions to maintain a stable internal state.
112050	114762	17	A	0.99998	This is a crucial process for survival.
114826	117926	18	A	0.99996	It allows individuals to predict and adapt to their environment.
118058	132850	19	A	0.90628	In the context of human societies, active inference plays a critical role in explaining how individuals navigate complex social situations, conform to social expectations, and make decisions that align with their beliefs and values.
133590	144730	20	A	0.96926	Furthermore, we'll explore the concept of deontic value within active inference, which refers to the value attributed to actions based on their adherence to social norms and expectations.
147390	158190	21	A	0.99998	By adhering to social norms, individuals can minimize the uncertainty associated with their actions and maintain a sense of predictability and stability in their social environment.
158530	168080	22	A	0.99983	So, together, all these insights will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between active inference, social norms, and human decision making.
168710	170274	23	A	0.98601	So let's dive in.
170472	173310	24	A	0.9643	We'll start by introducing a philosophical framework.
173470	182642	25	A	0.9999	Building on the framework of active inference in activism offers us a complementary lens to understand the dynamic and contextual nature of social cognition.
182786	193342	26	A	0.9999	So, while active inference provides the computational underpinnings for understanding social norms and decision making, we still need to anchor ourselves within a larger theoretical framework.
193506	201050	27	A	0.68118	Inactivism enriches this perspective by emphasizing the practical and developmental aspects of social understanding.
202830	207134	28	A	0.99983	So what is inactivism if it hasn't been introduced before?
207332	221490	29	A	0.89867	Inactivism is a philosophical stance that extends beyond traditional theories of cognition, emphasizing the role of interactions and relational dynamics in shaping both individual and social cognition.
223270	232098	30	A	0.99992	It argues that cognition is a dynamic, real time, fluid, and contextual social action.
232274	237880	31	A	0.99999	You can read more about this in Ineshi Bolito's texts and Thomas van S in 2022.
238810	247050	32	A	0.99983	Generative models and Hermeneutics serve as a cognitive structure and framework for interpretation, respectively.
248110	258110	33	A	0.99996	These elements are continuously updated based on social interactions and signals, thereby facilitating effective communication and understanding.
258850	268510	34	A	0.97391	Hermeneutics provides a theoretical framework for interpreting social signals and cues crucial for effective social interactions.
269590	278530	35	A	0.89232	So Hermeneutics allows for a nuanced understanding of contextually constituted meaning.
279110	288630	36	A	0.99114	It goes beyond the conventional notion of Self contained objects to explore the deeper contextual meanings in behavior and cognition.
290250	303050	37	A	0.15088	Yatimer's Hermeneutics offers a way to analyze social action that goes beyond positivist and humanist approaches by fusing the conceptual schemes of the observer and the social actor.
304110	317630	38	A	0.99997	It complements inactivism by providing the interpretive framework that are continuously updated through social interactions, enriching our understanding of cognition as dynamic, real time, and contextual.
319110	337990	39	A	0.99963	In the realm of social cognition, inactivism introduces the concept of generalized synchronization, which allows for a nuanced understanding of how social interactions mutually influence cognitive processes.
339290	348380	40	A	1.0	The relationship between individual beliefs and social expectations is complex, and it's fundamentally shaped by our interactions with the others and the world.
349790	355930	41	A	0.99998	We thus see that meaning is coconstituted by the individual and the environment.
356430	367070	42	A	0.99998	If we adopt an activist and Hermeneutics approach, we find the philosophical foundations that lead into a comprehensive overview of the intersection with social cognition.
367650	374180	43	A	0.99996	If you want more references to read about these topics, you can ask me at the end of the class, and I can send you a few.
375510	384470	44	A	0.99988	So it's essential to note, however, that there are some criticisms that point out the limitations of inactivism in explaining social cognition.
385770	395370	45	A	1.0	One of the key criticism is that current articulations of inactivism are not yet up to the task when it comes to explaining complex social interactions.
397470	406160	46	A	0.6425	Despite these criticisms, inactivism provides a consistent epistemology for a psychology that is intrinsically social.
407810	416090	47	A	0.99938	Looking forward, the field of inactivism and social cognition is ripe for exploration and would benefit from a deeper connection to active inference.
416170	429810	48	A	0.99987	There has been such research, so researchers like Maxwell Ramstead has developed a concept of inactive inference, which offers a promising avenue for integrating inactivism and active inference.
430410	439350	49	A	0.81408	His research aligns with folk psychology and suggests that these frameworks can coexist and enrich our understandings of social cognition.
440490	449734	50	A	0.99942	Future other directions could involve, for instance, integrating inactivism with other cognitive theories and exploring its applicability in real world social scenarios.
449862	454890	51	A	1.0	Through its connection to active inference, we can make accurate and testable predictions.
456450	473182	52	A	0.99977	So while inactivism now provides us with a foundational understanding of cognition and social interaction, the concept of agency further enriches this understanding by introducing more philosophical perspectives that align with or diverge from inactivism.
473246	478050	53	A	0.99829	So we can build on top of inactivism through the notion of agency.
480570	487874	54	A	0.99852	So we will now focus on the key issue of inactivism, which is how does agency emerge?
487922	492674	55	A	1.0	How do things self organize through their interaction with the environment?
492722	494670	56	A	0.54635	Why are they not fully determined?
494850	504410	57	A	1.0	How can we account for agency in a system where effectively self organization is seen as some degree of determined by the materiality of the agent and its environment?
506290	515390	58	A	0.64561	Agency is a complex construct that has been explored through a multitude of philosophical and scientific frameworks.
515890	529250	59	A	1.0	One prominent approach is the inactive affordance based perspective, which underscores the centrality of the I can notion in shaping both cognitive processes and behavioral outcomes.
529830	537750	60	A	0.99951	So Maxwell Ramstead again substantiates this perspective and resonates with the research conducted by Bruenberg in 2018.
538330	548330	61	A	0.99598	It posits, for instance, that agency is far from being a mere passive state rather, it involves active, dynamic engagement with the environment.
550110	566110	62	A	0.99983	Current investigations in this domain are being, for instance, continued by researchers like Riddipitlia, who is working on connecting properly the psychological phenomenon of agency in active inference modeling.
566850	575090	63	A	0.82357	In parallel, Tom Helmholtzian Bayesian models conceptualize active inference as a Bayesian process aimed at minimizing prediction error.
575910	590630	64	A	0.99991	This model finds support in the work of Kalan Kopp and suggests that agency is an active endeavor who aligns sensory inputs with internal predictions, thereby fostering a sense of control and self efficacy.
591930	599370	65	A	1.0	The cybernetic interpretations offers a more mechanistic lens, focusing on control mechanism in homeostasis.
600030	609978	66	A	1.0	In this view, agency is not just about accurate predictions, but also about maintaining a balanced state through dynamic interpretations.
610074	620370	67	A	0.94948	Interactions sorry with the environment Recent studies highlight the significance of performance based inferences in shaping our sense of agency.
622630	632710	68	A	0.99982	That approach suggests that the congruence between our actions and their expected outcomes plays a pivotal role in strengthening or weakening our sense of agency.
633610	643830	69	A	0.9999	So collectively, these diverse interpretations serve as intellectual bridges connecting the domains of philosophy, psychology, and computational neuroscience.
644510	658750	70	A	0.99996	They offer complementary insights that enrich our understanding of agency, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on inactivism and its application in understanding complex cognitive and social phenomena.
661670	665410	71	A	0.99999	So how is agency extended?
666550	669562	72	A	0.99998	Deep temporal models and the concept of agency.
669726	675240	73	A	0.99994	Both focus on the minimization of uncertainty and the optimization of decision making.
676090	692810	74	A	0.99993	Deep temporal models provide a computational framework that can model the complex time dependent patterns of behavior and cognition, offering insights into how agency is exercised in dynamic social contexts.
693630	714210	75	A	0.99999	In the context of our overall goal of understanding scripts through active inference, combining deep temporal models with theories of agency allows us to create more nuanced and predictive models of how individuals navigate social norms and make decisions through goal directed actions across different scales of concern.
715190	730360	76	A	0.60457	In social cognition, deep temporal models help individuals anticipate and adapt to changes in their social environment across timescales that go beyond what would be considered simply reactive, thereby reducing uncertainty and enhancing decision making.
732350	737100	77	A	1.0	An individual can plan and extend agency beyond the current moment.
738510	748430	78	A	0.99998	So, in the realm of planning algorithms, deep temporal models allow us for a theoretical foundation for optimality, especially when resources are limited.
749010	755150	79	A	0.60997	They enable state abstraction and cognitive control, essential elements in hierarchical planning.
755970	764500	80	A	0.52097	Deep temporal models also contributes to various cognitive processes such as action understanding and language processing, which we will discuss later.
764950	773670	81	A	0.60825	They can be interpreted and integrated into deep reinforcement learning algorithms to develop socially aware navigation policies.
774650	784730	82	A	0.99991	Deep temporal models thus serve as a computational again, bridge between the neural mechanisms of action understanding and the cognitive processes that give rise to agency.
786750	798750	83	A	0.99977	So what might be potentially a neural mechanism that allows us to connect deep temporal models to social interactions?
799330	804030	84	A	0.75532	This is where we bring in the insights from mirror neuron systems and active inference.
804450	812290	85	A	0.99999	This way, we can have a more comprehensive models that not only predicts but explains how individuals exercise agency in complex social landscapes.
814390	826760	86	A	0.99997	Here, mirror neurons serve as a neural cornerstone for social cognition, firing not only during the execution of an action, but also during the observation of that same action performed by another.
827610	837260	87	A	0.63375	These specialized neurons are central to the continuous updating of internal models of the environment, including the actions and intentions of others.
838190	850270	88	A	0.99995	They minimize uncertainty and facilitate navigation through complex social landscapes, allowing us for smoother social interactions and more effective communication.
851650	865490	89	A	0.99968	So here, the deep temporal models are hierarchical generative models that offer a computational framework, and these models are adept at handling the complexities of self agency and other agency.
866230	882018	90	A	1.0	In the context of self agency, a deep temporal models affords a high bias or precision to proprioceptive predictions, which gives us a nuanced understanding of one's own actions when observing another.
882124	888570	91	A	0.99996	This bias is adaptively suppressed, enabling the system to be flexible and context sensitive.
890670	897520	92	A	1.0	The interplay between mirror neurons and deep temporal model is thus a compelling area of research.
898210	906910	93	A	0.90565	Mirror neurons contribute to the process of updating internal models, which is a core function of deep temporal models.
907510	923030	94	A	0.96461	This synergistic relationship allows for a more nuanced understanding of action prediction, we can see a deep and significant implication for long term planning in social context.
923190	936110	95	A	1.0	The continuous updating of internal models facilitated by mirror neurons and computationally powered here through the deep temporal models, is crucial for making complex decisions and planning future social interactions.
937890	949730	96	A	0.99981	There's been recent research that indicates that our capacity to understand actions extend beyond the mirror neuron systems, which involves the activation of areas signaling unexpected events.
950550	967110	97	A	1.0	This adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate interplay between the neurons and the models, which suggest that our understanding of action prediction and social cognition is far from complete, but is advancing rapidly thanks to these integrated frameworks.
967530	978890	98	A	0.62664	So, given the ongoing research on mirror neurons, we have to consider how computational models, like deep temporal models can offer a more nuanced framework for studying these neural mechanisms.
981070	988160	99	A	0.99008	So let's try to think about some of the issues with mirror neuron research.
989890	991930	100	A	0.99332	It's not without controversy.
992090	998590	101	A	1.0	Some critical reviews argue that there's no compelling evidence supporting the role of mirror neurons in action understanding.
999090	1006686	102	A	0.9951	Others can suggest that mirror neurons may be involved in lower level processes of action perception, but not in higher level intention understanding.
1006878	1015510	103	A	0.99991	So we need more studies to control for premotor contributions to action perception and provide a clearer definition of what is meant by action understanding.
1016250	1023690	104	A	0.99997	This is particularly important as some research indicates that there may be no proof that mirror neurons lead to action understanding.
1025230	1028006	105	A	0.99997	This doesn't mean that it negates the importance of these systems.
1028038	1033850	106	A	0.99973	It means we need more research to make sure that they are in fact related to action understanding.
1034670	1044880	107	A	0.82	The functional properties of the mirror neuron system indicates that action understanding may primarily be based on the motor cognition that underpins one's own capacity to act.
1045490	1052930	108	A	0.99994	So we will now consider how these neural mechanisms can be integrated into broader frameworks like extended and optimized active inference.
1053430	1065350	109	A	0.99974	So by doing so, we can leverage generative models to provide a more nuanced understanding of action perception, prediction, social cognition, and adapting behaviors to lead us to scripts, gender perspectives, and cultural affordances.
1067290	1069560	110	A	1.0	We have expanded in time.
1070090	1072380	111	A	0.78182	Now let's expand in space.
1073790	1083690	112	A	0.98252	Extended and optimized active inference represents a comprehensive framework that bridges between internal cognitive processes and external environmental interactions.
1084770	1097810	113	A	0.99844	Generative models serve as the cornerstone, extending beyond the confines of an organism's brain and body, to incorporate external cognitive resources such as maps or written language.
1098310	1107890	114	A	0.99999	This extension not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of these models, but also has practical implications in various domains like social interactions and language processing.
1109450	1119910	115	A	0.99981	If we think of a cognitive niche, the framework introduces key dynamics like selective developmental and organism niche coordination.
1120650	1132810	116	A	1.0	The dynamics elucidate the intricate relationship between organisms and their environment, including the reciprocal effects of environmental modifications and selection pressures.
1134050	1139470	117	A	0.86068	In sequential dynamics, generative models facilitate effective communication and understanding.
1140450	1151374	118	A	0.99996	They allow us to see the emergence of behavioral and neurophysiological correlates, such as Theta gamma coupling, which we will discuss later in neural activity, which can be seen as an emergent property of belief.
1151422	1165410	119	A	0.99801	Updating under variational message Passing Building upon the foundational aspects of extending an optimized active inference, it's crucial to delve into its specific applications in social context.
1166730	1181930	120	A	1.0	When we optimize our generative models through social scripts and norms, we can see how extending active inference serves as a practical tool for navigating and modifying complex social landscapes, aligning with the framework's broader goals of cognitive niche construction.
1183870	1190240	121	A	0.99984	So we can see that this integrates both internal and external cognitive resources to optimize the generative model.
1193010	1201166	122	A	0.69929	Scripts serve as a cognitive blueprint that reduce the uncertainty and facilitate successful social interactions.
1201358	1206782	123	A	0.60273	They are continuously updated through adapted, changing social landscapes.
1206926	1210630	124	A	0.9997	They enhance the fluidity and adaptability of social behaviors.
1211930	1223610	125	A	0.99999	Social norms act as a macro level behavioral expectation that shapes the social environment and creates favorable niches for human interactions.
1224510	1232890	126	A	0.99999	These norms are internal representations that help individuals navigate complex social environments effectively.
1235170	1244990	127	A	0.99934	So here, cognitive niche construction involves active modification of the environment to create those favorable contexts.
1246210	1256130	128	A	0.87306	Extended active inference takes this a step further by allowing for the optimization of generative models, creating environments that are not just favorable but also harmonious.
1257270	1268710	129	A	1.0	The comprehensive approach here has implications that span from psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and allows us to potentially set the stage for future research in cognitive science.
1270730	1278010	130	A	0.99981	So here we see that there's an importance to optimizing internal models for effective social interactions.
1278590	1295150	131	A	0.99967	So, while extended active inference focuses on the broader cognitive architecture involving generative models and social norms, here we zero in on the role of deontic value and social conformity, providing a more nuanced understanding of how individuals adapt and shape their social environment.
1296290	1305330	132	A	0.99456	So, the concept of Deontic value refers to the value attributed to actions based on their adherence to social norms and expectations.
1307110	1310310	133	A	0.77539	It allows us to guide individual choices.
1310970	1324250	134	A	0.99983	When faced with a decision, an individual weigh the deontic value of potential actions against other factors like personal preferences, beliefs, to determine the most appropriate course of action.
1324830	1326380	135	A	0.83724	He'll just allow me one.
1330660	1340812	136	A	0.9941	So this ties us very nicely to the notion of agency that we explored before in regimes of expectations by Axel Constance.
1340956	1352200	137	A	0.99995	We elaborate that Deontay cues enable the environment to learn about the behavior of its inhabitants, effectively outsourcing the epistemic and pragmatic values of any behavior.
1355450	1360230	138	A	0.65716	You can see that the expansion of active inference here takes on a whole other meaning.
1362090	1376060	139	A	0.99464	So active inference allows for dynamic adaptation, enables the individual to update their internal models better anticipate and connect to their environment, such that the environment and the individual mutually model each other.
1376990	1382750	140	A	0.61	The deontic value here serves as a common thread between active inference and regimes of expectations.
1385900	1393390	141	A	0.99999	Through these regimes of expectation in active inference, we'll achieve a better understanding of social conformity and decision making.
1397030	1412280	142	A	0.99922	Regimes of expectation centers on the computational construct of deontic value, which we explained before and aligns with the broader research on social conformity, especially the winner takes all model proposed by Frank in 2008.
1414170	1426090	143	A	0.99995	Social expectation here play a significant role in shaping human decisions, and specifically, social conformity act as a learning strategy which is effective in uncertain environments.
1426990	1439920	144	A	0.99876	So now that we build on the foundational role of deontic value and the regimes of expectation, we find that this computational construct also serve as a crucial weighing factor in individual decision making.
1441590	1446180	145	A	0.99766	So we'll see how we can put this effect directly on decision making.
1452360	1452964	146	A	0.79059	Sorry.
1453082	1460040	147	A	0.99505	Regimes of expectations have basically a function of fitness enhancing social conformity.
1460620	1465000	148	A	0.99995	It suggests that conforming to social norms has evolutionary advantages.
1465820	1473020	149	A	0.65354	It leads into a circular causality between shared Bayesian expectations and individual policy selection.
1474080	1482450	150	A	0.99449	It's consistent with findings by Sanfi in 2014, which emphasize the importance of norms and expectations in social decision making.
1485390	1500560	151	A	0.9999	So now that we have how the environment and the individual co construct through these regimes of expectations, we will find how this allows us to construct a sense of self, specifically the social self.
1502210	1511890	152	A	0.56243	Here, social norms and shared Bayesian expectations link our individual and collective decision making processes to the broader understanding of selfhood.
1518170	1522840	153	A	0.99996	So how does active inference allow us to model how we derive the sense of self?
1523790	1530940	154	A	0.9971	Let's start by explaining the three main types of selves, minimal narrative and social.
1532350	1541840	155	A	0.57	The minimal self is the prereflexive experience of being a subject emphasizing the body's role in shaping subjective experience.
1543730	1548630	156	A	1.0	The narrative self is shaped by personal stories and experiences.
1548810	1565140	157	A	0.9997	Highlighting the importance of generative models in organizing these experiences aligns with the active inference, formalism, and psychological desires, providing a coherent narrative that guides our sense of self across time.
1567270	1577450	158	A	0.25	The social self emerges from interactions with others and is influenced by social norms, values, and shared generative models.
1579550	1589150	159	A	0.76121	This concept is supported by the folk concept of intentionality, which includes desires, beliefs, intentions, awareness, and skill.
1590850	1600770	160	A	0.99999	Understanding these facets of the sense of self through the lens of active inference gives us an integrative cognitive process for emotions and social interactions.
1602070	1611330	161	A	0.99812	So now we'll delve more into the intricacies of the social self to show that the generative model and social scripts discussed earlier are integral to its formation.
1611830	1625050	162	A	0.538	These scripts, optimized through extended active inference, not only guide our social interaction, but also contribute to the shaping of that self, creating a seamless interplay between individual cognition and collective social behavior.
1626990	1636730	163	A	0.93983	So, as we said earlier, social scripts are the cognitive blueprints that guide individuals through a myriad of expected actions or events in social contexts.
1637250	1643230	164	A	0.99912	These scripts are essentially generative models that help individuals predict and navigate social interactions.
1644130	1645242	165	A	0.99927	They're indispensable.
1645306	1652340	166	A	0.99999	They allow us to continuously update our internal models to minimize uncertainty and achieve a stable internal state.
1653270	1660690	167	A	0.99148	It's particularly important in a world where social interactions are increasingly complex and laden with unspoken expectations.
1663640	1675220	168	A	0.82309	Its optimization serves as a micro level mechanism that complements the macro level influence of social norms and deontic values, creating a cohesive understanding of social behavior.
1677020	1689224	169	A	0.99988	Social scripts can be enshrined in deontic cues, which enable the environment to learn about the behavior of its inhabitants, effectively outsourcing the epistemic and pragmatic values of any behavior.
1689272	1706400	170	A	1.0	As we saw earlier in cognitive niche construction, the concept of contextual modulation integrates sensory and motor cues to influence our actions and decisions, allowing for dynamic adaptation and refinement of generative models.
1709710	1723790	171	A	1.0	Through this modulation, we can see how social scripts and norms are shaped and adapted over time, which promotes the adaptability in the face of changing environments of individuals embedded in that environment.
1727540	1746760	172	A	0.99814	Now, contextual modulation here is pretty important and the mechanism not only refines our generative model, but also provides the adaptive flexibility required in complex environments, which unites the theoretical underpinnings of active inference with empirical findings on adaptive behavior.
1749580	1761900	173	A	0.98659	So, according to Francesco Donoruma, action perception is an active inferential process that combines motor prediction and hypothesis testing crucial for understanding social scripts.
1762800	1770240	174	A	0.98049	Adaptive social behavior thus results from the dynamic interplay of socioeffective and socio cognitive processes.
1771380	1780980	175	A	0.99994	Research by Berg Merza provides proof of concept that social context may alter perception, enabling more adaptive behavior.
1782200	1793320	176	A	0.79372	It's also supported by studies that reveal how instinctive behavior circuits in the hypothalamus dynamically encode spatial and sensory cues to drive adaptive social behaviors.
1795020	1807416	177	A	0.99969	Contextual modulation and social scripts are integral to adaptive behavior and action perception, which allows us to show how social interactions are crafted through these different scale.
1807528	1813100	178	A	0.99923	These deep temporal models that integrate various kinds of priors at different scales.
1813920	1831140	179	A	0.99976	So here, contextual modulation acts as a linchpin in the integration of social scripts into the generative models we can now appreciate how generative model and social scripts coalesce to form a comprehensive framework for understanding interactions.
1835270	1853030	180	A	0.56647	So active inference is a nuanced lens to explore how power dynamics shape shared generative models, thereby influencing the cultural affordances available to individuals.
1854650	1864250	181	A	1.0	For instance, epistemic communities serves as platforms where power dynamics can significantly shape shared beliefs and actions.
1864990	1885090	182	A	1.0	Through the construction of certain niche, we can see that existing power structure lead to the creation of environments that perpetuate these structures through certain kinds of scripts, certain kinds of norms, and through the valence that we associate to our sense of self relative to these scripts.
1886390	1891406	183	A	0.99989	Cultural affordances here are dynamically influenced by power tinged asymmetries.
1891598	1900790	184	A	0.58247	These asymmetries can affect how individuals perceive and enact social scripts, which further shapes the cultural affordances that they encounter.
1903370	1909210	185	A	1.0	We see how deeply intertwined cultural affordances are with power dynamics.
1910510	1916250	186	A	0.64093	It allows us to understand societal structures in more depth.
1917710	1930590	187	A	0.99742	So when we expand the scope of active inference in cultural affordance negotiation, we can dive into a case study, that of gender norms and gender fluidity to broader cultural contexts.
1931670	1935250	188	A	0.99433	This exemplifies the influence of power dynamics.
1936870	1947000	189	A	0.99997	So just as individuals navigate and adapt to cultural affordances that are deeply shaped by societal power structures, they have to navigate gender related affordances that they also engage with.
1950990	1954970	190	A	0.99995	So through this, we can also understand the concept of gender fluidity.
1955950	1963834	191	A	0.99998	Here, generative model play a specific role, which is to adapt to changing societal norms and gender related affordances.
1963882	1965790	192	A	0.99992	These are cultural affordances.
1967330	1975810	193	A	0.92089	Dynamic for Maniche construction allows individuals to create and adapt environments that reflect their evolving gender identity and expression.
1977990	1982100	194	A	1.0	The concept of affordance negotiation is particularly relevant here.
1982630	1991910	195	A	0.99996	It refers to the process by which individuals adapt their behavior to maximize opportunities and minimize challenges in their environment.
1993530	2000090	196	A	0.99999	In the context of gender fluidity, it involves navigating complex social scripts and norms that shape gender expression.
2002190	2008960	197	A	0.99998	Research suggests that these gender differences in negotiation are contextually bound and can be subject to change.
2010050	2020590	198	A	0.99997	By understanding how individuals navigate these social scripts and norms, we can, for instance, address the limitations or constraints that affect expressions of their gender identity.
2022390	2036114	199	A	0.99993	So here, gender through the lens of active inference as a case study and affordance negotiation gives us a comprehensive view of the social psychology and how it can apply to gender studies, for instance.
2036162	2039350	200	A	0.99348	But this is true for many other kinds of cultural phenomena.
2041210	2047210	201	A	0.99996	So we build now on the understanding of how active inference and power dynamics shape cultural affordances.
2049630	2072542	202	A	1.0	We can see how this allows us to understand potentially puzzling actions which are shaped by social scripts and the dynamics within the epistemic communities they inhabit so we have defined how scripts allow us to interpret different kinds of behaviors and how people navigate their desired outcomes.
2072606	2079730	203	A	0.99992	Given these social scripts, so what happens when we are faced with puzzling actions?
2080550	2084470	204	A	0.99999	People rely on their generative models to update their beliefs and expectations.
2084810	2089910	205	A	0.99992	So do we interpret these behaviors based on inherent traits or situational reasons?
2091290	2099338	206	A	0.99995	Here, traits and motives interact with in predicting behaviors, channeling the behavioral expression through one's life throughout one's life.
2099504	2104838	207	A	1.0	On the other hand, contextual cues significantly influence the interpretation of ambiguous behaviors.
2105014	2119120	208	A	0.68069	Social scripts Guide Our expectation in social situations can either be adapted when confronted with unexpected behavior or allow us to shift from script to script to have a better prior over what we might expect next.
2120850	2126830	209	A	0.99995	So, for instance, this challenge is particularly pronounced for those who diverge from established social norms and script.
2126990	2132850	210	A	0.54885	Their interpretations are influenced by the dynamics of information spread within their epistemic communities.
2134010	2142230	211	A	0.99994	Understanding ambiguous social behaviors is not just about individual cognition, but also about the social and cultural contexts that shape our interpretations.
2144970	2152570	212	A	0.99841	So now we're going to dive from this point into the specific contextual factors that further nuance our understanding.
2153550	2166910	213	A	1.0	Our former discussion emphasized the influence of power and social norms, and now we're going to turn our attention to the impact, say, of social anxiety, behavioral flexibility, and goal oriented perception in shaping our interpretations of social behavior.
2169410	2175250	214	A	0.99999	Understanding social behaviors often requires an approach that goes beyond trade based interpretations.
2176070	2190710	215	A	0.99356	Contextual factors like social anxiety can significantly influence how we interpret an ambiguous social cue, for instance, determining the most likely prior, using the most likely prior, rather than being open to other kinds of interpretations.
2192010	2195480	216	A	0.70664	Behavioral flexibility is another crucial aspect to consider.
2196270	2207770	217	A	0.9991	It allows for adaptability and nuanced understanding of social behaviors across different social contexts, such that a same script can be interpreted different ways through different kinds of behaviors.
2208530	2213258	218	A	0.56	The concept of goals here plays an important role in social perception.
2213434	2228130	219	A	0.99973	They can serve to provide a broad implication or for where we understand an individual to try to be headed, such that while their lower level script may be different from the one we have, their higher level script is still interpretable.
2231660	2238312	220	A	0.99992	So now we're going to try to see what can be the outcomes in real life of all these processes.
2238376	2246780	221	A	0.99992	Together, we're going to focus on cognitive mechanisms that underpin social phenomena like confirmation bias and echo chambers.
2247780	2260900	222	A	0.99973	Building on the concept of active inference, we explore how individuals not only interpret ambiguous social cues, but also actively seek information that confirm their preexisting belief, thereby shaping epistemic communities.
2265370	2271320	223	A	0.93526	Confirmation bias is a cognitive tendency that affects information spread and decision making.
2271770	2279340	224	A	0.99993	It is driven by agents seeking information that confirms their preexisting belief while avoiding challenging information.
2280350	2287450	225	A	0.9999	This is an effective way of using action to minimize free energy rather than updating beliefs in a costly manner.
2288930	2298320	226	A	0.97976	Echo chambers amplify this bias by creating self reinforcing loops where individuals selectively expose themselves to aligned information.
2299410	2307970	227	A	0.99886	So research indicates that network structures contribute to the persistence of echo chambers, thereby affecting policy making and public discourse.
2308630	2314550	228	A	1.0	The minimization of free energy transfers to the network, thereby shaping the environment.
2315370	2322630	229	A	0.90958	We can see here how there is a loop where the environment both shapes the individual, who will in turn continuously shape the environment.
2323690	2338474	230	A	0.99997	Interestingly, some studies have identified a reverse confirmation bias whereby some people actually do seek out information in an explorative manner, which again aligns with this idea of active inference.
2338522	2349662	231	A	0.99856	Epistemic value and here we may try to ponder why certain people are more likely to break out of their echo chambers rather than stay in them.
2349796	2367830	232	A	1.0	This may align, potentially with deep temporal models, whereas we can see value at a later point in time and perhaps focus more on this expected value rather than on the direct value of the confirmation bias.
2370170	2383130	233	A	1.0	To mitigate such biases, we can use strategies such as fostering epistemic change through diverging information and encouraging reflection to break apart echo chambers.
2385390	2389390	234	A	0.99972	Now we've explored a little bit confirmation bias and echo chamber.
2389890	2394590	235	A	1.0	We can see how this extends to human communication.
2395410	2407170	236	A	0.99999	This allows us to explore the principles of active inference, which shape individual cognitive tendencies, and the influence of the broader dynamics of communication and collective intelligence on the environment.
2409190	2418950	237	A	0.9994	So we can link communicative behavior to biological imperative of minimizing free energy, which emphasizes the action oriented nature of communication.
2419690	2427610	238	A	1.0	The framework allows for adaptive behavior even when the models deviate from vertical representations of the environment.
2427950	2440182	239	A	0.9989	So how do we justify that people lie or that people say things which don't seem to align properly with what everybody else seems to believe about the environment?
2440246	2442298	240	A	0.99985	Effectively, this is an action.
2442394	2451090	241	A	0.99931	You're trying to push a belief onto the environment such that there is a potential for the environments to be shaped in a way that evidences your beliefs.
2453270	2461198	242	A	0.99987	So we can think of cognitive control here, whereby active inference has an effective goal, maintenance in working memory.
2461374	2467826	243	A	0.99999	It provides top down guidance for overt behavior, moving beyond stereotyped responses.
2468018	2474630	244	A	0.99999	Our understanding of communication is enriched by introducing neurobiologically plausible computational hypotheses.
2475550	2485590	245	A	1.0	The ecological approach to active inference is a framework that understands the complexities of human communication across different scales.
2485750	2496350	246	A	0.99992	It explores how individuals contribute to the collective intelligence of a group or society by fostering a collaborative approach that leverages diverse skills and knowledge.
2497250	2508020	247	A	0.74759	This is one of the reasons echo chambers are maintained they're efficient in the transmission of information and promote collaboration among agents who overtly share a model.
2510710	2518790	248	A	0.99998	So now we're going to look at a more detailed understanding of ecological dimensions of this discourse.
2520970	2531370	249	A	0.9997	Context, as we saw earlier, plays a crucial role in the activation of predictive inferences, which offers further support for ecological approaches.
2531950	2539840	250	A	0.99964	Active inference models contain terms that encode both the object of desire and the strength of desire at the psychological level.
2540370	2549470	251	A	0.99998	So the context of enactive inference suggests that generative and recognition models are best cast as realizing inference and control under the free energy principle.
2551030	2565350	252	A	0.99952	So in this way, communication through the active inference lens gives us an action oriented nature of cooperative communication, where together we mutually craft our models such that we can achieve a common goal.
2567610	2576330	253	A	0.99351	So now and lastly, let's dive into a very short overview of how this may translate to language processing.
2577710	2581690	254	A	0.99977	So remember, we discussed deep temporal models here.
2581760	2586650	255	A	0.99999	They enable us to explore the sequential dynamics of language processing.
2587230	2594430	256	A	1.0	The models are hierarchical, where inference at higher levels informs the selection of words at lower levels.
2594930	2601330	257	A	1.0	This hierarchical structure allows for the accumulation of evidence over nested timescales.
2601830	2608814	258	A	1.0	One key aspect is the emergence of behavioral and neurophysiological correlates in those sequential dynamics.
2608942	2612410	259	A	0.99822	Like the Theta gamma couplings that we discussed earlier.
2612590	2622630	260	A	0.99672	It's a phenomenon that again was observed and allows us to measure belief updating under variational message passing.
2623930	2627990	261	A	0.99299	Thus, generative models aren't just predictive but also explanatory.
2628070	2632170	262	A	0.99998	They can help us understand neural mechanisms like language comprehension.
2634900	2641270	263	A	0.9176	So in cognitive control, linguistic can be scoused as individual agents contributing to this intelligence of the group.
2642200	2648980	264	A	1.0	And the research shows that generative models are central to the perception and interpretation of the linguistic signals.
2649640	2655800	265	A	1.0	We have a structural understanding of sequences of words and their context sensitivity.
2656620	2665980	266	A	0.99998	This enables the agent to resolve uncertainty about the underlying conceptual, semantic or lexical causes of sensory input.
2667760	2677280	267	A	0.68877	It can incorporate beliefs about narratives, the type of question, the scenic state of the world, a semiotic factor indicating the topic of discussion.
2678340	2683600	268	A	0.9506	These factors generate expectations for the lower level, such as syntax and semantics.
2685140	2692740	269	A	0.61417	Models enable inference through this deep temp structure about the narrative, such as those seen in reading.
2695670	2705270	270	A	0.99998	Here, the neural processes can be understood in terms of simulating the epistemic origin seen in reading and other language related activities.
2707610	2720170	271	A	0.97661	So, to conclude, we have seen comprehensive understanding of active inference, inactivism and their interplay in shaping social cognition behavior.
2721150	2732510	272	A	0.99995	We have explored various philosophical perspectives such as the inactive affordance based perspective, the helmholtzium Beijing model, and highlighted their contribution to understanding our social interactions.
2733010	2741806	273	A	0.99787	We've explored deep temporal models as a potent computational tool for modeling complex time dependent patterns in social cognition, such as in language.
2741838	2753350	274	A	0.84793	As well, we've discussed the role of mirror neurons, emphasizing their potential centrality in continuously updating internal models of the environment and their significance in social cognition.
2755690	2761590	275	A	0.93199	We discussed potential future directions for research if you are interested in these topics.
2763210	2766382	276	A	0.99992	So, here, the interplay between active inference and activism.
2766466	2773290	277	A	0.90495	Computational models, like deep temporal models, give us a multidimensional view of social cognition and agency.
2774190	2782590	278	A	0.99999	It broadens the scope of research, but also brings us closer to our goal of understanding the complex cognitive and social phenomena.
2784530	2789280	279	A	0.99999	So, for next class, I offer you an opportunity.
2790150	2807480	280	A	0.37828	You should pick a text from this session from the references that will be made available, or one that you find yourself in the literature, read it, and try to explain how it ties to the concepts that we explored today.
2808170	2816540	281	A	0.7761	Ideally, you can present it to the group, take five minutes, explain what the text says and how it connects to the contents of the course.
2817310	2821100	282	A	0.99972	If you have any questions, we can potentially take them now.
2827770	2828914	283	B	0.99994	Thank you, Mao.
2829042	2830470	284	B	0.99776	That was epic.
2831290	2835734	285	B	0.96278	All right, well, people can write questions in the chat.
2835782	2837260	286	B	0.85637	I'll just read one.
2838510	2839420	287	B	0.99873	All right.
2839870	2843340	288	B	1.0	Where does identity and ideology fit.
2846530	2850270	289	A	0.99962	In my presentation or in the framework that I'm presenting?
2851090	2853310	290	A	0.99895	So I'm going to assume it's in the framework.
2855250	2857682	291	A	0.99973	Identity fits as a social self, right?
2857736	2864690	292	A	0.58053	Identity is literally how you craft yourselfhood relative to the narratives that you're given.
2864840	2868462	293	A	0.9943	So it's precisely the social self that we discussed.
2868606	2883046	294	A	0.99647	Ideology corresponds to a looser, let's say, weak script that allows you to shift the valence of certain values across certain norms.
2883158	2895130	295	A	0.99918	So, let's assume that you understand values as a higher or lower probability for a type of level behavior.
2895210	2896842	296	A	0.99999	So, I value kindness.
2896986	2914420	297	A	0.90167	There'll be a high prior over kindness, and therefore, the paths, the policies that lead to what I ascribe to as kindness will therefore become more likely to be adopted and will become a norm if more of us value the same thing.
2914870	2929170	298	A	1.0	The key issue here is, how do I associate the semantics of kindness to the actual pragmatic representations and actions that correspond to what I believe to be kindness?
2929250	2931926	299	A	1.0	And this is where the co construction happens, right?
2932028	2936566	300	A	0.99999	We communicate together, and I'm going to say, this is kindness.
2936678	2939126	301	A	0.99806	I'm acting on the world to determine.
2939238	2941574	302	A	0.99997	Now, this is what we will believe to be kindness.
2941622	2947326	303	A	1.0	And I value kindness very highly because that's my ideology, and therefore, this is what we should be doing.
2947428	2951194	304	A	1.0	All these things connect together through the interaction of the environment.
2951322	2956670	305	A	0.95	The symbols encrusted in the environment that I share and co construct through communication.
2959030	2959780	306	B	0.53594	Wow.
2960230	2965054	307	B	1.0	And how does that have an impact on affordances?
2965182	2967060	308	B	0.99972	Was the follow up question there.
2969190	2979080	309	A	0.99929	So if we go back to the part of the course about affordances, we saw that certain things are made more likely given the niche that you are in.
2979770	2988646	310	A	0.99999	If you understand the onto cues, you see that there's going to be some signals that pull you as attractors in a specific direction.
2988838	2994930	311	A	0.67591	So let's assume that we have an ideology, again, that promotes kindness in the environment.
2995030	3002160	312	A	0.99994	It is highly likely that potential pathways towards kindness will be made more available.
3002610	3009894	313	A	0.99302	So, for instance, let's assume that we believe that giving money to people is kindness.
3010042	3013218	314	A	0.99938	There's going to be more initiatives for you to give money.
3013304	3031686	315	A	0.99066	So, for instance, I don't know if you guys have taken the plane recently, but Air Canada has started program where if you have loose change in your pockets, you can put it in the seat in front of you in a little pocket thing and you can put the money there and they're going to donate it.
3031708	3034134	316	A	0.9969	Now, I'm not saying that's kindness.
3034182	3044506	317	A	0.99999	We can argue about the politics of it all and the tax, et cetera, but this is an affordance that wasn't there before, and now it's in my environment now.
3044528	3050350	318	A	1.0	I don't have to take it, but it's now more readily available for me to actually act on it.
3050420	3052494	319	A	1.0	And you can see this across every level.
3052612	3057514	320	A	0.56792	It's just that most affordances are invisible to us as affordances.
3057562	3059246	321	A	0.8998	We just react to them.
3059268	3065298	322	A	0.99999	We just exist within them, but we don't consider they wouldn't be there, such as a bathroom in a house.
3065464	3071010	323	A	1.0	This is one of the things that allows us to think more critically about what it means to be homeless.
3071350	3075014	324	A	0.56505	Like to you, it seems obvious when you need to go to the bathroom, you'll go to the bathroom, right?
3075052	3081126	325	A	0.99883	There's a bathroom available to you, but there isn't one for people who live outside because they don't have a home.
3081228	3085578	326	A	0.96	And yet we've criminalized the act of relieving yourself outside.
3085744	3089318	327	A	0.99998	So we've basically said, well, don't pee.
3089414	3091334	328	A	1.0	Or if you pee, well, you're now a criminal.
3091382	3098986	329	A	0.99999	So being homeless by virtue of not having access to the same affordances means it's effectively criminal to be homeless.
3099098	3110978	330	A	0.99995	So these are the kinds of ways that ideology shapes our affordances and effectively pulls us in a state of attraction and effectively in different states of power as well.
3111064	3120802	331	A	0.99298	Because we collectively have decided that the only people who get to have the right to certain affordances are the people who have enough money to live in a house.
3120856	3122370	332	A	0.99	Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
3125490	3125902	333	B	0.99991	Thanks.
3125956	3126830	334	B	0.99956	There's a lot there.
3126900	3128074	335	B	0.99498	All right, I'll read a comment.
3128122	3133118	336	B	0.99999	This is something you could address right now, or save it for the discussion or however you want.
3133204	3142546	337	B	0.79324	Michael wrote, would you be open to attempting to map a social or personal narrative rather than another element in the literature, E.
3142568	3142802	338	B	0.97	G.
3142856	3145890	339	B	0.87993	Translating the hero's journey or twelve step recovery?
3146730	3148358	340	A	0.77518	I'm not sure I understand.
3148444	3149990	341	A	0.77246	Attempting to map.
3152090	3162730	342	B	0.77993	Connect the active ontology informalisms to a more broadly understood narrative or specific script.
3163950	3170262	343	A	0.99959	Yeah, big fan of the hero's journey.
3170326	3181306	344	A	0.99991	But why do we want, say, why do we feel like the hero's journey in itself is valuable?
3181498	3190740	345	A	0.99998	We feel that it's valuable because we feel that it is a very easy explanation for why somebody would have value.
3191190	3196742	346	A	1.0	And it is usually easy to minimize free energy through.
3196796	3198050	347	A	0.99774	Well, there's a clear path.
3198130	3198662	348	A	0.99986	Right.
3198796	3205702	349	A	0.99998	This person wasn't the result of very complex interactions of the environment or whatever.
3205756	3207846	350	A	0.99319	It's actually, no, it's all him.
3207948	3209910	351	A	0.56325	He just understood the.
3209980	3211474	352	A	0.64995	He understood what he had to do.
3211532	3213002	353	A	0.99993	He figured out what he had to do.
3213056	3213706	354	A	1.0	And there you go.
3213728	3214586	355	A	0.99948	He was able to do it.
3214608	3222160	356	A	1.0	And so this is a signal for perfect fitness to the landscape, right.
3222610	3224570	357	A	0.72783	It's perfect cognitive grip.
3224730	3245758	358	A	0.9999	So it's like there's an underlying assumption that this one person was able to update their generative model sufficiently such that they were perfectly able to grab every affordance that the environment gave them to go towards their state objective.
3245854	3247842	359	A	0.9999	So in terms of active inference, it's pretty simple.
3247896	3255618	360	A	0.99992	It's someone that has the capacity to go from a very unfit generative model to a very fit generative model relative to the environment.
3255714	3260874	361	A	1.0	And so we like that narrative because it's like, okay, well, then that means everybody can do it, right?
3261072	3274334	362	A	0.85532	If we can go from being a failure to being a hero, and all we have to do is take one or two hardships and go through it, then it's possible.
3274452	3277406	363	A	0.97729	Now, there's also some deification here, right?
3277428	3284420	364	A	0.99996	Because usually the hero's journey goes through some very difficult elements and comes out on the other side.
3285270	3295730	365	A	1.0	And we assume that because they can, there's a rationale of meritocracy, which is the world is relatively equal for everybody.
3295800	3308280	366	A	1.0	So it tries to pull away from every other power factor, ecological factor, and it's like, no, it's all about how you're able to fix your generative model to do the right things that you have to do.
3309130	3310906	367	A	0.58529	So that's why I'm not a fan of it.
3310928	3311738	368	A	0.99987	But I hope.
3311904	3319660	369	A	0.99943	Was this the mapping you were looking for in terms of active inference and reenergy minimization kind of thing.
3321330	3323102	370	B	0.99757	Here's one thought on that.
3323236	3333550	371	B	1.0	The hero's journey or another archetypal attractor, just archetype or just thread that way.
3333700	3341140	372	B	0.99989	It embeds a concise narrative account that is made legible through storytelling that we can understand.
3341510	3352546	373	B	1.0	And it embodies not just kind of mythical things, but also like real structural implicit features.
3352578	3361926	374	B	0.99996	That's why some stories can be so short and so transferable across contexts, because they abstract, but also it's what they do include in those cases.
3362038	3375630	375	B	0.79	And then you talked about how that conveys something about value, which is what supports social norms and social values, which of course, you can't point at anywhere.
3376770	3384740	376	B	0.99998	Yet what can you say about what are social norms or forces or what is the social?
3389510	3390980	377	A	0.99999	What is the social?
3393670	3394530	378	A	0.5	Um.
3397270	3399110	379	A	0.99	I think you can point to it.
3399180	3407670	380	A	1.0	I think you can effectively point to processes, you can point to material realities, institutions.
3409930	3421660	381	A	1.0	I think we tend to use the notion of the social to contrast it with the notion of the individual.
3422030	3424240	382	A	0.96606	It's just that nothing's ever that simple.
3424930	3432378	383	A	1.0	The individual is always built because of other individuals.
3432554	3436038	384	A	0.9998	So there's no really such thing as uninvival.
3436074	3437698	385	A	0.68578	You're always embedded within something.
3437784	3451810	386	A	0.99998	So the real question is, what's the scale that you're interested in, and what is identifiable as what may be within or without or outside of your control within that scale.
3451890	3459794	387	A	1.0	And we generally make a sort of conflation between what is social and what is uncontrollable.
3459922	3462186	388	A	0.99998	Even that's not necessarily true, as we saw, right.
3462208	3479562	389	A	0.9998	Because through our actions, which can be verbal, which can be physical, we reiterate or push on what constitutes what is valued by other actors within the same locality.
3479626	3491870	390	A	0.99995	So if you're asking what constitutes culture, well, at the level of my house, culture is we go to bed around ten to eleven.
3491950	3496370	391	A	1.0	Because if you don't go to bed at eleven, you're going to make noise and you're going to wake me up.
3496440	3499054	392	A	0.53731	So our shared culture is this.
3499112	3504454	393	A	0.97049	This is something that we repeat over time that constitutes an attractor for more than just me.
3504652	3511538	394	A	0.99963	If I look at the level of my building, nobody puts plants outside on their balcony.
3511554	3515974	395	A	0.98014	If it's at the level of Montreal, there's potholes everYwhere.
3516022	3519206	396	A	1.0	And we're not bitching really about it, we've all accepted there's potholes everywhere.
3519238	3522090	397	A	0.99626	So it's part of our culture, it becomes part of our conscious.
3522430	3524682	398	A	0.98	And so why is it cultural?
3524746	3539426	399	A	0.60383	It's because we can see that this behavior, these expectations, translate not just to you, to your own model, but it translates to the model of other people as well, and they can expect the same for you.
3539528	3542446	400	A	0.53254	It's something which is definitely shared.
3542478	3548210	401	A	0.99732	So I think you can easily point to things once you define the scale at which it becomes manifest.
3551160	3551620	402	B	0.99699	Thanks.
3551690	3552756	403	B	0.99995	Really interesting.
3552938	3565880	404	B	0.92447	All right, a question from Upcycle Club, who wrote, in terms of the philosophical dimensions of agency in active inference, what is the role of self referentiality?
3567500	3587404	405	A	1.0	I think you'd have to define the term, but if I understand correctly, we saw that you have to both model yourself and model the rest of the world in order to understand whether your actions are likely to have the effects you want to have on the world.
3587522	3596336	406	A	0.99998	So this self referentiality, if I understand correctly, but I could be wrong, is this notion of accurately modeling yourself as that?
3596438	3598050	407	A	0.73573	Does that answer the question?
3599080	3599828	408	B	0.9603	Yeah.
3599994	3600596	409	B	0.90277	All right.
3600698	3612532	410	B	1.0	A question from Michael, who wrote, I work with marginalized communities who experience the larger culture as dominant and scientifically enabled.
3612676	3620760	411	B	1.0	How should such communities fortify themselves against the more skillful extractive cultures?
3623900	3630700	412	A	0.93	I mean, that's the main question that's been for countercultures forever.
3633920	3636350	413	A	0.67362	It depends what you mean by fortify yourself.
3637780	3648704	414	A	0.75749	If you mean be less likely to be extracted from, I think the question is being extracted from without getting something in return.
3648902	3659072	415	A	0.97408	Because effectively, as you saw, for coordination to happen, you must provide something for the group in order for the group to move further.
3659136	3661872	416	A	0.99995	So it's always a little bit extractive.
3661936	3668536	417	A	1.0	You will always expend some degree of free energy in order to move towards the policy that you've chosen as a group.
3668638	3674924	418	A	0.55111	So there's two elements here, chosen as a group, and there should be a return on that as well.
3674962	3675116	419	A	0.99961	Right?
3675138	3679052	420	A	0.99848	It shouldn't be just, you pay, nobody else gives you something.
3679106	3686472	421	A	0.99846	So it's the degree to which the system minimizes everybody's free energy rather than minimizes this group's.
3686536	3693040	422	A	0.54	And this group is still a high free energy, low allostatic, high allostatic load, et cetera.
3695380	3697356	423	A	0.99975	I'm not the expert on that specifically.
3697388	3703104	424	A	0.99846	I'm sure there are people who have worked with marginalized group way more than I have who could give you better insights.
3703232	3727870	425	A	0.99987	But from what I've read, and if I can derive from the theory that we've presented today, you need to have a strong narrative that supports your capacity to increase your fitness landscape and increases and maintains the bonds, the mark of blanket around your group.
3729120	3742240	426	A	0.99998	If your group is likely to dissolve all the time, if it's constantly threatened and shaky, it's not going to be able to go very far, it's always going to be in protective mode.
3742660	3756516	427	A	0.99997	So you need to ensure that the group has strong bonds, that the group can expand, and that the group can together enact policies that lead it to minimizing free energy.
3756698	3778956	428	A	0.62	And relative to the larger group, that generally entails having more and more connections with individuals from the larger group, such that you are capable of changing their model little by little.
3779138	3791040	429	A	0.96667	You want to have a strong boundary, but you don't want to be unable to communicate with the external group, because if you do that, you can't communicate and co construct.
3792260	3815210	430	A	0.99997	So it seems trivial, but it's developing allyships, where you have people from the larger group that become people, that adopt your message and allow the expansion of your group and the ideology or the generative model of your group to be integrated within what determines the policies of the higher level group, or at least of the dominant extractive group.
3815820	3816932	431	A	1.0	I hope this helps.
3816996	3827470	432	A	1.0	I know it's not as concrete as one might want, but I'm sure people with much more experience in these fields would have much better answers for you.
3831440	3838850	433	B	0.77	I have a question that I've long had about some of your different research projects which you presented here.
3839380	3849410	434	B	1.0	Often there's this modeling of both the view from the inside with phenomenology, and also a view from the outside.
3850100	3854870	435	B	0.99912	So what can you say about active inference and that?
3856840	3857812	436	B	0.99962	What does that mean?
3857866	3859190	437	B	1.0	Where does that come from?
3859640	3862570	438	B	0.99999	How does that matter for the personal and the social?
3865570	3867870	439	A	0.77526	So imagine a mark of blanket.
3869010	3873006	440	A	1.0	Every mark of blanket entails there's an outside and an inside.
3873188	3875294	441	A	0.99994	Now you can always redraw it.
3875412	3879810	442	A	1.0	You can always consider it's wider, smaller.
3880150	3883022	443	A	0.99999	Inside your mark of blankets, there are mark of blankets.
3883086	3885300	444	A	0.9999	It's all mark of blankets, all the way down.
3885830	3894802	445	A	0.99985	So this notion of internal and external is only useful in relation to the measurement of a joint probability.
3894946	3895960	446	A	0.52168	That's it.
3900970	3902402	447	A	0.96278	It's not ontological.
3902466	3914282	448	A	1.0	In a sense, I can consider that my cells also have like an internal model and an external model, and I'm just some emergent scale.
3914426	3925710	449	A	0.60945	Given the connection between all these models that have an internal and external model, this group right now has a mark of blankets, which means us.
3925860	3931058	450	A	0.99999	We have spoken, and people who have not spoken to us do not have access to this information here.
3931144	3935058	451	A	1.0	And in order to exchange information, they'll probably have to speak to some of us.
3935144	3945046	452	A	1.0	And so there'll be an action that we put upon the world as a group with some degree of cohesion over time.
3945228	3957562	453	A	0.99995	So I think we have to understand internal and external really in those terms, in terms of temporality and objective outside of that.
3957696	3959930	454	A	0.99995	These are illusory boundaries.
3960510	3961898	455	A	0.87097	They're not real.
3962064	3967870	456	A	1.0	And because they're not real, we can sort of issue essentialism.
3968930	3977330	457	A	0.99987	If a boundary can always be redrawn relative to some kind of observer, then everything is always observer relative.
3977670	3981490	458	A	0.75	And there is no such thing as a thing which is a thing in itself.
3981560	3984942	459	A	0.99989	It's always relational, it's always phenomenal.
3985086	3987866	460	A	1.0	And how does this tie to phenomenality?
3987918	4000630	461	A	0.99723	Well, because we are talking through this mark of blanket, because we're like, we don't actually have access to the rest of the world except through this boundary.
4001070	4007642	462	A	1.0	The internal model is what effectively wiggles relative to the external world.
4007696	4018666	463	A	1.0	And therefore, you get phenomenality from this remodeling of the external world from this given boundary.
4018778	4029122	464	A	0.99998	So, for instance, our group's phenomenality of everybody else is our shared representation of who that even means, of what that even means.
4029256	4033570	465	A	0.99988	We have this phenomenal representation of that group.
4033640	4039798	466	A	0.99984	We could even potentially create symbols for them.
4039884	4049014	467	A	0.99979	We could create actual representations which would become kind of what would constitutes qualia at the level of our group.
4049132	4051782	468	A	0.919	So, yeah, I think I've answered your question.
4051836	4055162	469	A	1.0	I get lost in my thoughts sometimes, but it's great.
4055216	4060378	470	B	0.95175	All right, I'm going to read a comment from Abel, who just requested this comment to be read.
4060544	4065102	471	B	0.47865	Avel wrote, I'd like to add some things about the ideology question.
4065236	4068298	472	B	0.99995	You have a diversity of definitions of ideology.
4068394	4072638	473	B	1.0	For the purposes of the demonstration, I'll cluster them into two.
4072804	4074602	474	B	1.0	One, post structuralist.
4074666	4079090	475	B	1.0	In this context, an ideology is any system of value or of instrumentation of the world.
4079160	4080802	476	B	0.99999	This is the definition Mao used.
4080936	4086894	477	B	0.99998	In this case, everything is ideology, because the basic way we perceive the world is value ridden.
4087022	4089266	478	B	1.0	And two, structuralist.
4089458	4095670	479	B	1.0	In this context, an ideology is a system of discourse that dominates a given social context.
4096170	4101046	480	B	1.0	For structuralist definitions to apply, you need a lot more than shared values.
4101078	4107450	481	B	0.99992	You need a clergy that maintains and diffuses the specific discourse underlying the ideology.
4108030	4118190	482	B	1.0	I have a limited insight in the historical evidence, but as of my understanding, ideology as factor of mass mobilization is pretty much an early modern particularism.
4127990	4135442	483	A	1.0	I feel like that's if we cast it in terms of active inference, it would be the active states, right?
4135496	4136450	484	A	0.80367	Like you need.
4136600	4143266	485	A	0.67978	You need something which acts upon the world in order to create the self evidencing you require.
4143298	4145430	486	A	1.0	And that would be like the clergy, right?
4145500	4147654	487	A	0.59312	You need to push these beliefs onto the world.
4147692	4149814	488	A	0.99996	You can't just sort of let them happen.
4149932	4151786	489	A	0.91002	Especially if we talk about precision, right?
4151808	4153862	490	A	0.99975	Because, remember, everything Wiggles.
4153926	4155622	491	A	0.93824	Everything's always non stationary.
4155686	4159798	492	A	0.99997	We move, we change, we interpret, we reinterpret those degrees of uncertainty.
4159974	4167982	493	A	0.99996	So how do we make sure that we continue over time, that we don't just dilute, that our boundary stays very strong?
4168036	4173210	494	A	0.99843	That's what I was discussing earlier with the groups that want to be avoid extractivism.
4173370	4174986	495	A	0.78569	You need to proselytize.
4175098	4180926	496	A	0.99997	You need to make sure that the same narratives we return, we always return to that same narrative.
4180958	4200930	497	A	0.95	And how, if we look at the clergy, for instance, I don't know if it was a mistake or not, but for a time, the only way to preach was in Latin, which means the only way to access the word of God was through these people who not only had to give you the word of God, but they also controlled what it meant.
4201010	4202546	498	A	0.97458	Because you don't speak Latin.
4202578	4203606	499	A	1.0	I don't speak Latin.
4203718	4204986	500	A	0.99949	I'm going to believe you.
4205088	4206374	501	A	0.94564	You have that knowledge.
4206502	4215534	502	A	0.9987	So it goes back to these structures of power, where there are some people that have more access to influencing others, right.
4215572	4228020	503	A	0.99995	They can push their beliefs with more precision on others, and others just kind of have to follow because they have no real way to themselves interpret and potentially shift narrative themselves.
4233410	4235280	504	A	0.99961	When you do that, I feel like I'm pretty.
4237170	4238062	505	B	0.99222	There's a lot there.
4238116	4247886	506	B	1.0	One part that I thought was very interesting was variational free energy is about observations.
4247998	4254130	507	B	1.0	And in what you had added just recently, you talked about the measurement of a joint probability.
4254790	4260360	508	B	1.0	There has to be like an aboutness of sensory observations for that thing.
4261050	4264850	509	B	0.99991	Otherwise it has not even a sensory.
4264930	4269180	510	B	0.96189	It's not even an inanimate thing, unless it has this.
4269790	4271514	511	B	0.62446	That doesn't mean it's an interesting thing.
4271552	4294158	512	B	0.65	And I think that's what the recent work helps clarify with this sort of taxonomy, from inert to more classically active control systems, on through just the infinite possibilities of broadly cognitive modeling ecosystems of shared intelligence.
4294334	4301186	513	A	0.93297	Yeah, I think that's a really interesting, really interesting distinction you just made.
4301208	4306040	514	A	0.96975	So the paper by Lance and co.
4309290	4316066	515	A	0.99988	Maybe that is the key, because maybe this is a hot take, but I generally lean towards panpsychism.
4316178	4325210	516	A	1.0	I do believe that if consciousness is the substrate, then everything is some degree of conscious, and we can stop using the word conscious and we can use the word model.
4325360	4325722	517	A	0.9699	Right.
4325776	4335262	518	A	0.54171	There's the degree to which there's a response between the internal states of the microblanket and the external states.
4335316	4340510	519	A	0.99955	So there is some exchange of information there, and whatever is done with the exchange, maybe nothing.
4340660	4344666	520	A	0.68	And this may be the aboutness.
4344858	4348010	521	A	0.99991	Your internal model has no aboutness.
4348170	4357110	522	A	0.72373	It's just there is information that was inputted, and the only thing that it outputs is a constants of its boundary, and that's it.
4357260	4379420	523	A	0.9	And therefore, in order to have aboutness, you have to have the possibility for your internal states to shift, to move your boundary somehow towards something more specific, to segregate, to discretize the external world into things that have more or less valence relative to your.
4379810	4383114	524	A	0.99702	Very, very akin to what Donald Hoffman is suggesting.
4383162	4383760	525	A	0.99893	Basically.
4388250	4421700	526	B	0.99946	Building on that, and throughout your presentation I got a sense of the kind of two cultures, the sciences and the humanities, not that they were exactly being represented in the talk, but in terms of excellent style and classical approach and the non overlapping magisteria idea that they're sort of a separable technical from the social.
4422870	4444200	527	B	0.97	And even though it's widely clear that the beliefs in the moment shape the niche that has these feedback things, the development of top down architectures in some way that become top down affordances for those or other people at some future time.
4447630	4451850	528	B	0.99935	So where do we go from there?
4451920	4470078	529	B	1.0	And just like thinking about that space, how do you approach chapter six of the textbook in terms of the recipe for the active inference generative model for a social setting?
4470194	4471690	530	A	0.72	For a social setting.
4472910	4495270	531	A	1.0	Okay, I think we go from semantics and we map the semantics of a group and you qualify what that group is.
4495340	4498322	532	A	1.0	Maybe the description length of that group is extreme.
4498466	4505126	533	A	0.99999	Maybe the description length is my neighbor, your neighbor, me and three of their cats, but not the fourth.
4505158	4505658	534	A	0.99988	You know what I mean?
4505664	4512400	535	A	0.64028	Like maybe there's a cluster there and we map the semantics of that group and it's very specific.
4512850	4525646	536	A	1.0	And then through those semantics, there's an inherent causal structures of the structure of the beliefs through which we could together, like our own little experts, try to map.
4525678	4527890	537	A	0.53015	Well, okay, what are our states?
4527960	4528990	538	A	0.99999	What are observations?
4529070	4530500	539	A	1.0	How do we map to this?
4530950	4537954	540	A	1.0	And we try to test that model, and then let's assume that we disagree.
4538082	4556940	541	A	0.9937	So we're going to have different kind of breakdowns of reality, and we're going to test the different models in a sort of Bayesian expansion or Bayesian model reduction, or just testing different models and DCM style and seeing which one maps better to the expected observations we're going to see given our model.
4558190	4559690	542	A	0.98	And you can do this for anything.
4559760	4565550	543	A	0.99979	You can do this for a small group of neighbors, you can do this for a very large group of people.
4565620	4570430	544	A	0.99996	You can do this for participant research, you can do this for medicine.
4571250	4584754	545	A	1.0	I think it's really about how do people carve nature at its joints and can they point to the exact observations which they believe are part of the carvings or not?
4584952	4585974	546	A	1.0	I think that's possible.
4586012	4599994	547	A	0.88297	In social sciences, it's just about taking the time to formalize how observations map to the carving together.
4600192	4607690	548	A	1.0	I think social sciences generally tend to push back against a carving.
4609070	4613870	549	A	0.99999	They will prefer something that resembles more a manifold.
4615090	4623066	550	A	0.61712	It ebbs and flows, and it's like there's some prototypical stuff, but mostly there's stuff that could come in and out and stuff, and that's fine.
4623108	4624402	551	A	0.98762	You can be accounted for.
4624536	4636894	552	A	0.99916	So if you look at different carvings, we can work them through on a sort of probability and say, well, this is much less likely.
4636942	4640594	553	A	0.99984	It's possible it fits within the carving, but it's much less likely.
4640722	4641286	554	A	0.99939	What about this?
4641308	4651462	555	A	0.983	Well, this is really like, let's put a probability on this, and maybe to you, the probability is that's frank.
4651526	4652540	556	A	0.99994	It's in there.
4653230	4664670	557	A	0.82	I think they'd be more comfortable with something that's less binary and something that's more curved and allows for new things to be added were we to disagree on inclusions, et cetera.
4666530	4673986	558	B	0.99997	That's a great point on kind of a narrow note, but to what you just said there, let's just say that there's four options.
4674168	4681842	559	B	0.99999	If our prior is 10 zero, then any number of evidence times zero stays zero.
4681896	4683534	560	B	0.99998	So that's, like, essentially fixed.
4683582	4685970	561	B	1.0	And that's when the hyperparameter is fixed.
4686390	4699718	562	B	1.0	And then if you enable even a tiny amount of non zero value, and so it's like 0.99 and then a bunch of zeros, then that can still rise off the baseline.
4699814	4709740	563	B	1.0	And then that's the whole question of attention and cognition, is how do you stay aware of relevant, salient information, relevance, realization, and all that.
4710690	4720638	564	B	0.99979	Another point was about the causal model from the outside, the part that the person doesn't directly control.
4720724	4726130	565	B	0.84917	There's no direct control in the active, generative models of action observations.
4726790	4729214	566	B	0.99991	It has to go through the niche.
4729262	4731250	567	B	0.99998	That's how the thing is defined.
4731830	4735566	568	B	0.54	And so only indirectly can observations be changed.
4735598	4738642	569	B	1.0	And so that's the kind of part that you don't have agency over, literally.
4738706	4753706	570	B	0.9986	Although the other glass half full side is that is to the extent that you do have agency over that, and then where that glass is and what narrative actually puts water into the glass or not?
4753888	4759020	571	B	1.0	And then what is the glass half full, glass half empty part?
4760110	4767040	572	B	0.99999	It brings so much and just so much, like, on the personal thought side.
4767410	4796582	573	B	0.99999	But also, it's just really interesting to see how this line of research, which was more qualitative several years ago, like in the 2016 to 18 time, and just to see how different motifs have come into play with the generative models so it's a pretty cool lecture, and many people appreciated your work in the chat, so that's cool.
4796636	4799480	574	B	0.99998	Do you have any other comments or anything you want to talk about?
4800270	4804330	575	A	0.87078	No, but I'm going to have to go in about two minutes.
4804400	4817450	576	A	0.99992	But I would like to encourage people to really participate in the next one, to read some texts and to express their ideas, because this is how we percolate.
4817530	4818122	577	A	0.7955	Percolate.
4818186	4819194	578	A	0.99999	This is how we percolate.
4819242	4821214	579	A	0.99995	Good ideas and future research.
4821332	4826062	580	A	1.0	And the field of social sciences is ripe for this.
4826116	4835746	581	A	0.56289	There's so much that can be done right now, translated, connected, like, we can get towards a confluent time in research and science.
4835898	4836600	582	A	0.39606	It.
4837130	4837990	583	B	0.99365	All right.
4838140	4845990	584	B	0.99992	Really looking forward to the discussion and hoping that people engage in this affordance.
4847690	4849734	585	B	0.98664	All right, thank you.
4849772	4850214	586	B	0.99954	See you.
4850252	4850370	587	A	0.90992	Bye.
