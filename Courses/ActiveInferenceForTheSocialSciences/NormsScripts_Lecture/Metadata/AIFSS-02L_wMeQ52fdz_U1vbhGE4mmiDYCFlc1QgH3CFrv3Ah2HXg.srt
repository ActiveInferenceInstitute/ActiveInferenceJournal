1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,214
You. Hello and

2
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,590
welcome. It's September 20, 2023.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,538
We're at the Active Inference Institute

4
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,766
in the course, active Inference for the

5
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,626
social Sciences, and here with Mao

6
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,702
Aberrassen, who will be presenting today

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,862
on norm scripts and linguistics under

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,246
active inference. So thank you, Mao, to

9
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,406
you. Awesome. So, hi, everyone.

10
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:34,006
In as last time,

11
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:37,906
there was a presentation on semiotics

12
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,742
and semantics. I won't dig too far into

13
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:42,806
linguistics, but I'll touch on it at the

14
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:46,506
end of the course. So what

15
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:48,950
are we going to do in this module?

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,642
We're going to explore the concept of

17
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:53,386
active inference and its relevance to

18
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,798
social norms and human decision making.

19
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:59,642
As you will have seen in the previous

20
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,726
classes, active inference is a

21
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:03,486
theoretical framework that seeks to

22
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,026
explain how organisms, including humans,

23
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:07,486
engage with their environment to

24
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,154
minimize uncertainty and maintain their

25
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,634
internal states. We're not going to dig

26
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,714
into these concepts too, too much,

27
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,380
because I assume they have been

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,654
previously explained. At length,

29
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:21,014
however, I will explain how they connect

30
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,874
to social phenomena. So this framework

31
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:25,814
has significant implications for

32
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,326
understanding social behavior, as it can

33
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:30,534
help explain how individuals conform to

34
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:33,594
social norms and make decisions based on

35
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:36,694
the expectations of others. We'll delve

36
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:38,586
into the role of active inference in

37
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:41,974
human societies, emphasizing how humans

38
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,346
and other organisms constantly seek to

39
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,834
minimize their uncertainty about the

40
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,934
world by updating their beliefs and

41
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:49,802
taking actions to maintain a stable

42
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:53,322
internal state. This is a crucial

43
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:55,386
process for survival. It allows

44
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,118
individuals to predict and adapt to

45
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:58,866
their environment. In the context of

46
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,806
human societies, active inference plays

47
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,426
a critical role in explaining how

48
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,970
individuals navigate complex social

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,970
situations, conform to social

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,306
expectations, and make decisions that

51
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:12,850
align with their beliefs and values.

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,398
Furthermore, we'll explore the concept

53
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,226
of deontic value within active

54
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,390
inference, which refers to the value

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,406
attributed to actions based on their

56
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,866
adherence to social norms and

57
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:28,278
expectations. By adhering

58
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,826
to social norms, individuals can

59
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,906
minimize the uncertainty associated with

60
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,954
their actions and maintain a sense of

61
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:36,974
predictability and stability in their

62
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:40,094
social environment. So, together, all

63
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,934
these insights will provide you with a

64
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,726
comprehensive understanding of the

65
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,546
complex interplay between active

66
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:47,054
inference, social norms, and human

67
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:50,274
decision making. So let's dive in.

68
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,906
We'll start by introducing a

69
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,098
philosophical framework. Building on the

70
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,794
framework of active inference in

71
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:58,734
activism offers us a complementary lens

72
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,986
to understand the dynamic and contextual

73
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,254
nature of social cognition. So, while

74
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,406
active inference provides the

75
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:05,926
computational underpinnings for

76
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,650
understanding social norms and decision

77
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,146
making, we still need to anchor

78
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:12,514
ourselves within a larger theoretical

79
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,562
framework. Inactivism enriches this

80
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,054
perspective by emphasizing the practical

81
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:19,978
and developmental aspects of social

82
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:23,466
understanding. So what is

83
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:26,394
inactivism if it hasn't been introduced

84
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:29,322
before? Inactivism is a philosophical

85
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,962
stance that extends beyond traditional

86
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,606
theories of cognition, emphasizing the

87
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,450
role of interactions and relational

88
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,306
dynamics in shaping both individual and

89
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:41,490
social cognition.

90
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,598
It argues that cognition is a dynamic,

91
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,126
real time, fluid, and contextual social

92
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:54,166
action. You can read more about this in

93
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,582
Ineshi Bolito's texts and Thomas van S

94
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,006
in 2022. Generative models and

95
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,990
Hermeneutics serve as a cognitive

96
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,890
structure and framework for

97
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,050
interpretation, respectively.

98
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,582
These elements are continuously updated

99
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,234
based on social interactions and

100
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:15,794
signals, thereby facilitating effective

101
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:18,110
communication and understanding.

102
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,914
Hermeneutics provides a theoretical

103
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,550
framework for interpreting social

104
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,114
signals and cues crucial for effective

105
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:31,630
social interactions. So Hermeneutics

106
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,850
allows for a nuanced understanding of

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,530
contextually constituted meaning.

108
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,634
It goes beyond the conventional notion

109
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,294
of Self contained objects to explore the

110
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:47,346
deeper contextual meanings in behavior

111
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,630
and cognition.

112
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,806
Yatimer's Hermeneutics offers a way to

113
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:54,950
analyze social action that goes beyond

114
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,282
positivist and humanist approaches by

115
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,666
fusing the conceptual schemes of the

116
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:03,050
observer and the social actor.

117
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,586
It complements inactivism by providing

118
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,654
the interpretive framework that are

119
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,510
continuously updated through social

120
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,574
interactions, enriching our

121
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,826
understanding of cognition as dynamic,

122
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:17,630
real time, and contextual.

123
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,170
In the realm of social cognition,

124
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,842
inactivism introduces the concept of

125
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,810
generalized synchronization,

126
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,866
which allows for a nuanced understanding

127
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,058
of how social interactions mutually

128
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,990
influence cognitive processes.

129
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,854
The relationship between individual

130
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,030
beliefs and social expectations is

131
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,398
complex, and it's fundamentally shaped

132
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,514
by our interactions with the others and

133
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:51,446
the world. We thus see that meaning

134
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:54,842
is coconstituted by the individual and

135
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,994
the environment. If we adopt an activist

136
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,494
and Hermeneutics approach, we find the

137
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,574
philosophical foundations that lead into

138
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,654
a comprehensive overview of the

139
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,966
intersection with social cognition. If

140
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:10,186
you want more references to read about

141
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,098
these topics, you can ask me at the end

142
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,180
of the class, and I can send you a few.

143
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,666
So it's essential to note, however,

144
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,914
that there are some criticisms that

145
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:22,674
point out the limitations of inactivism

146
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:26,198
in explaining social cognition. One of

147
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,070
the key criticism is that current

148
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,294
articulations of inactivism are not yet

149
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,406
up to the task when it comes to

150
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:35,370
explaining complex social interactions.

151
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,422
Despite these criticisms, inactivism

152
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,066
provides a consistent epistemology for a

153
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:46,160
psychology that is intrinsically social.

154
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,426
Looking forward, the field of inactivism

155
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,494
and social cognition is ripe for

156
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,478
exploration and would benefit from a

157
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,090
deeper connection to active inference.

158
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,434
There has been such research, so

159
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:02,690
researchers like Maxwell Ramstead has

160
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,494
developed a concept of inactive

161
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,606
inference, which offers a promising

162
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:08,738
avenue for integrating inactivism and

163
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:12,578
active inference. His research aligns

164
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,726
with folk psychology and suggests that

165
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,850
these frameworks can coexist and enrich

166
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,350
our understandings of social cognition.

167
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,066
Future other directions could involve,

168
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,006
for instance, integrating inactivism

169
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,754
with other cognitive theories and

170
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,154
exploring its applicability in real

171
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,394
world social scenarios. Through its

172
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,074
connection to active inference, we can

173
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:34,890
make accurate and testable predictions.

174
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,846
So while inactivism now provides us with

175
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,334
a foundational understanding of

176
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:43,246
cognition and social interaction, the

177
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:46,126
concept of agency further enriches this

178
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,770
understanding by introducing more

179
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,862
philosophical perspectives that align

180
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:54,514
with or diverge from inactivism. So we

181
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,466
can build on top of inactivism through

182
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,050
the notion of agency.

183
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,390
So we will now focus on the key issue of

184
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,250
inactivism, which is how does agency

185
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,830
emerge? How do things self organize

186
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,326
through their interaction with the

187
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:13,714
environment? Why are they not fully

188
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,074
determined? How can we account for

189
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,894
agency in a system where effectively

190
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,198
self organization is seen as some degree

191
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,906
of determined by the materiality of the

192
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,410
agent and its environment?

193
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,166
Agency is a complex construct that has

194
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:31,742
been explored through a multitude of

195
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,390
philosophical and scientific frameworks.

196
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,654
One prominent approach is the inactive

197
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,314
affordance based perspective, which

198
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,898
underscores the centrality of the I can

199
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:46,942
notion in shaping both cognitive

200
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:50,194
processes and behavioral outcomes. So

201
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:52,066
Maxwell Ramstead again substantiates

202
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,278
this perspective and resonates with the

203
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,750
research conducted by Bruenberg in 2018.

204
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,014
It posits, for instance, that agency is

205
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,994
far from being a mere passive state

206
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,582
rather, it involves active, dynamic

207
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,330
engagement with the environment.

208
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,262
Current investigations in this domain

209
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,474
are being, for instance, continued by

210
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,534
researchers like Riddipitlia, who is

211
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:21,182
working on connecting properly the

212
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,318
psychological phenomenon of agency in

213
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:28,042
active inference modeling. In parallel,

214
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,014
Tom Helmholtzian Bayesian models

215
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:31,666
conceptualize active inference as a

216
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,854
Bayesian process aimed at minimizing

217
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:37,166
prediction error. This model finds

218
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:39,314
support in the work of Kalan Kopp and

219
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,054
suggests that agency is an active

220
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,950
endeavor who aligns sensory inputs with

221
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,938
internal predictions, thereby fostering

222
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,630
a sense of control and self efficacy.

223
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,666
The cybernetic interpretations offers a

224
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,034
more mechanistic lens, focusing on

225
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,370
control mechanism in homeostasis.

226
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,018
In this view, agency is not just about

227
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:06,062
accurate predictions, but also about

228
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,654
maintaining a balanced state through

229
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,666
dynamic interpretations. Interactions

230
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:13,434
sorry with the environment Recent

231
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,966
studies highlight the significance of

232
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,846
performance based inferences in shaping

233
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,370
our sense of agency.

234
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,146
That approach suggests that the

235
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,954
congruence between our actions and their

236
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,126
expected outcomes plays a pivotal role

237
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:31,670
in strengthening or weakening our sense

238
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,594
of agency. So collectively,

239
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:37,430
these diverse interpretations serve as

240
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,846
intellectual bridges connecting the

241
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:42,166
domains of philosophy, psychology, and

242
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,530
computational neuroscience. They offer

243
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,962
complementary insights that enrich our

244
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:50,070
understanding of agency, thereby

245
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,346
contributing to the broader discourse on

246
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,634
inactivism and its application in

247
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,374
understanding complex cognitive and

248
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:58,750
social phenomena.

249
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,410
So how is agency extended?

250
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,834
Deep temporal models and the concept of

251
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:11,378
agency. Both focus on the minimization

252
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:14,214
of uncertainty and the optimization of

253
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:17,762
decision making. Deep temporal models

254
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:20,054
provide a computational framework that

255
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:23,622
can model the complex time dependent

256
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,250
patterns of behavior and cognition,

257
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,674
offering insights into how agency is

258
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:32,810
exercised in dynamic social contexts.

259
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,694
In the context of our overall goal of

260
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,546
understanding scripts through active

261
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,834
inference, combining deep temporal

262
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,526
models with theories of agency allows us

263
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,266
to create more nuanced and predictive

264
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:47,142
models of how individuals navigate

265
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,034
social norms and make decisions through

266
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,690
goal directed actions across different

267
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,842
scales of concern. In social

268
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:58,802
cognition, deep temporal models help

269
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:00,646
individuals anticipate and adapt to

270
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:02,130
changes in their social environment

271
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,726
across timescales that go beyond what

272
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,106
would be considered simply reactive,

273
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:08,966
thereby reducing uncertainty and

274
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:13,146
enhancing decision making. An individual

275
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:16,138
can plan and extend agency beyond the

276
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:19,318
current moment. So, in the realm

277
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,126
of planning algorithms, deep temporal

278
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,574
models allow us for a theoretical

279
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:26,398
foundation for optimality, especially

280
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:29,754
when resources are limited. They enable

281
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:32,126
state abstraction and cognitive control,

282
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,314
essential elements in hierarchical

283
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,860
planning. Deep temporal models also

284
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,982
contributes to various cognitive

285
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,966
processes such as action understanding

286
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,506
and language processing, which we will

287
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,606
discuss later. They can be interpreted

288
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,086
and integrated into deep reinforcement

289
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,634
learning algorithms to develop socially

290
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:53,670
aware navigation policies.

291
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,566
Deep temporal models thus serve as a

292
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:59,286
computational again, bridge between the

293
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,074
neural mechanisms of action

294
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:02,534
understanding and the cognitive

295
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,730
processes that give rise to agency.

296
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,006
So what might be potentially a neural

297
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,738
mechanism that allows us to connect deep

298
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:18,750
temporal models to social interactions?

299
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,386
This is where we bring in the insights

300
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,226
from mirror neuron systems and active

301
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:25,726
inference. This way, we can have a more

302
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,362
comprehensive models that not only

303
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,454
predicts but explains how individuals

304
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:31,234
exercise agency in complex social

305
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:32,290
landscapes.

306
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,926
Here, mirror neurons serve as a neural

307
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,010
cornerstone for social cognition,

308
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,606
firing not only during the execution of

309
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,494
an action, but also during the

310
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,362
observation of that same action

311
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:48,546
performed by another. These specialized

312
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,226
neurons are central to the continuous

313
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,098
updating of internal models of the

314
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,722
environment, including the actions and

315
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:59,110
intentions of others. They minimize

316
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,310
uncertainty and facilitate navigation

317
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,754
through complex social landscapes,

318
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,326
allowing us for smoother social

319
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,274
interactions and more effective

320
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,638
communication. So here,

321
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,414
the deep temporal models are

322
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,046
hierarchical generative models that

323
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,754
offer a computational framework, and

324
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,746
these models are adept at handling the

325
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,642
complexities of self agency and other

326
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:28,350
agency. In the context of self agency,

327
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,382
a deep temporal models affords a high

328
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:34,114
bias or precision to proprioceptive

329
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,386
predictions, which gives us a nuanced

330
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:41,030
understanding of one's own actions when

331
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,034
observing another. This bias is

332
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,626
adaptively suppressed, enabling the

333
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:47,734
system to be flexible and context

334
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:51,574
sensitive. The interplay

335
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,578
between mirror neurons and deep temporal

336
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,894
model is thus a compelling area of

337
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:59,726
research. Mirror neurons contribute to

338
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,042
the process of updating internal models,

339
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:05,626
which is a core function of deep

340
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,814
temporal models. This synergistic

341
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:11,406
relationship allows for a more nuanced

342
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:13,810
understanding of action prediction,

343
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,194
we can see a deep and significant

344
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,946
implication for long term planning in

345
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,326
social context. The continuous updating

346
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,078
of internal models facilitated by mirror

347
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,930
neurons and computationally powered here

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,946
through the deep temporal models, is

349
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,706
crucial for making complex decisions and

350
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,110
planning future social interactions.

351
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,534
There's been recent research that

352
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,974
indicates that our capacity to

353
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:43,806
understand actions extend beyond the

354
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,234
mirror neuron systems, which involves

355
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:48,286
the activation of areas signaling

356
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:51,522
unexpected events. This adds another

357
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,202
layer of complexity to the already

358
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,758
intricate interplay between the neurons

359
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,114
and the models, which suggest that our

360
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,526
understanding of action prediction and

361
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:02,854
social cognition is far from complete,

362
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:05,494
but is advancing rapidly thanks to these

363
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,358
integrated frameworks. So, given the

364
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,598
ongoing research on mirror neurons,

365
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:13,622
we have to consider how computational

366
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,226
models, like deep temporal models can

367
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,034
offer a more nuanced framework for

368
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:18,890
studying these neural mechanisms.

369
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,294
So let's try to think about some

370
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,514
of the issues with mirror neuron

371
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:31,930
research. It's not without controversy.

372
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,458
Some critical reviews argue that there's

373
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,206
no compelling evidence supporting the

374
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,594
role of mirror neurons in action

375
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:40,386
understanding. Others can suggest that

376
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,922
mirror neurons may be involved in lower

377
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,790
level processes of action perception,

378
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,582
but not in higher level intention

379
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:48,190
understanding. So we need more studies

380
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,566
to control for premotor contributions to

381
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,626
action perception and provide a clearer

382
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,434
definition of what is meant by action

383
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:57,106
understanding. This is particularly

384
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:58,626
important as some research indicates

385
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,474
that there may be no proof that mirror

386
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,690
neurons lead to action understanding.

387
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,826
This doesn't mean that it negates the

388
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,458
importance of these systems. It means we

389
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,954
need more research to make sure that

390
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,854
they are in fact related to action

391
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:16,074
understanding. The functional properties

392
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,754
of the mirror neuron system indicates

393
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,594
that action understanding may primarily

394
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:22,366
be based on the motor cognition that

395
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,880
underpins one's own capacity to act.

396
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,306
So we will now consider how these neural

397
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,330
mechanisms can be integrated into

398
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,266
broader frameworks like extended and

399
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,114
optimized active inference. So by doing

400
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:35,746
so, we can leverage generative models to

401
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,426
provide a more nuanced understanding of

402
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,782
action perception, prediction, social

403
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,766
cognition, and adapting behaviors to

404
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:43,634
lead us to scripts, gender perspectives,

405
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,350
and cultural affordances.

406
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,560
We have expanded in time.

407
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,380
Now let's expand in space.

408
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,894
Extended and optimized active inference

409
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,494
represents a comprehensive framework

410
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,134
that bridges between internal cognitive

411
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,694
processes and external environmental

412
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:06,574
interactions. Generative models serve as

413
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:09,486
the cornerstone, extending beyond the

414
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:11,534
confines of an organism's brain and

415
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:14,522
body, to incorporate external cognitive

416
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:17,006
resources such as maps or written

417
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:19,634
language. This extension not only

418
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,858
enhances the efficiency and accuracy of

419
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,694
these models, but also has practical

420
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,586
implications in various domains like

421
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:26,894
social interactions and language

422
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:30,818
processing. If we think of a cognitive

423
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:34,194
niche, the framework

424
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:36,834
introduces key dynamics like selective

425
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:38,898
developmental and organism niche

426
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,614
coordination. The dynamics elucidate

427
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,730
the intricate relationship between

428
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,810
organisms and their environment,

429
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,962
including the reciprocal effects of

430
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:51,546
environmental modifications and

431
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,794
selection pressures. In sequential

432
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,194
dynamics, generative models facilitate

433
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,494
effective communication and

434
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:01,646
understanding. They allow us to see the

435
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,214
emergence of behavioral and

436
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,150
neurophysiological correlates, such as

437
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,786
Theta gamma coupling, which we will

438
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:09,026
discuss later in neural activity, which

439
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,994
can be seen as an emergent property of

440
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:12,686
belief. Updating under variational

441
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,626
message Passing Building upon the

442
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,754
foundational aspects of extending an

443
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,534
optimized active inference, it's crucial

444
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:24,046
to delve into its specific applications

445
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:27,766
in social context. When we optimize our

446
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,378
generative models through social scripts

447
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:30,866
and norms, we can see how extending

448
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:32,614
active inference serves as a practical

449
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:35,094
tool for navigating and modifying

450
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:37,946
complex social landscapes, aligning with

451
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,026
the framework's broader goals of

452
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,930
cognitive niche construction.

453
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,854
So we can see that this integrates both

454
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,514
internal and external cognitive

455
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,562
resources to optimize the generative

456
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:50,240
model.

457
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,026
Scripts serve as a cognitive blueprint

458
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,354
that reduce the uncertainty and

459
00:19:58,392 --> 00:20:00,050
facilitate successful social

460
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,910
interactions. They are continuously

461
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,730
updated through adapted, changing social

462
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,254
landscapes. They enhance the fluidity

463
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,630
and adaptability of social behaviors.

464
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,574
Social norms act as a macro level

465
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,326
behavioral expectation that shapes the

466
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:21,614
social environment and creates favorable

467
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,922
niches for human interactions. These

468
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,674
norms are internal representations that

469
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:31,050
help individuals navigate complex social

470
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,890
environments effectively.

471
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,750
So here, cognitive niche construction

472
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,646
involves active modification of the

473
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,914
environment to create those favorable

474
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:47,454
contexts. Extended active inference

475
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,454
takes this a step further by allowing

476
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,422
for the optimization of generative

477
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,346
models, creating environments that are

478
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:56,130
not just favorable but also harmonious.

479
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,894
The comprehensive approach here has

480
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,890
implications that span from psychology,

481
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,694
sociology, artificial intelligence, and

482
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,306
allows us to potentially set the stage

483
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:07,922
for future research in cognitive

484
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,586
science. So here we

485
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:12,954
see that there's an importance to

486
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:16,566
optimizing internal models for effective

487
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:19,638
social interactions. So, while extended

488
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,286
active inference focuses on the broader

489
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:22,934
cognitive architecture involving

490
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,070
generative models and social norms,

491
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,994
here we zero in on the role of deontic

492
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,766
value and social conformity, providing a

493
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,366
more nuanced understanding of how

494
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,302
individuals adapt and shape their social

495
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:37,966
environment. So, the concept

496
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:41,122
of Deontic value refers to the value

497
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,074
attributed to actions based on their

498
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:44,466
adherence to social norms and

499
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:47,986
expectations. It allows us

500
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,618
to guide individual choices. When faced

501
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:54,086
with a decision, an individual weigh the

502
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:56,386
deontic value of potential actions

503
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,790
against other factors like personal

504
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,346
preferences, beliefs, to determine the

505
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,250
most appropriate course of action.

506
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,380
He'll just allow me one.

507
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,976
So this ties us very nicely to the

508
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,730
notion of agency that we explored before

509
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,044
in regimes of expectations by Axel

510
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:22,408
Constance. We elaborate that Deontay

511
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,548
cues enable the environment to learn

512
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,912
about the behavior of its inhabitants,

513
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:29,868
effectively outsourcing the epistemic

514
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:32,200
and pragmatic values of any behavior.

515
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,746
You can see that the expansion of active

516
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,494
inference here takes on a whole other

517
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:43,106
meaning. So active inference

518
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:45,926
allows for dynamic adaptation, enables

519
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,446
the individual to update their internal

520
00:22:47,478 --> 00:22:50,874
models better anticipate and connect to

521
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,186
their environment, such that the

522
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,774
environment and the individual mutually

523
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:58,926
model each other. The deontic value here

524
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,826
serves as a common thread between active

525
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,750
inference and regimes of expectations.

526
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,136
Through these regimes of expectation in

527
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:10,364
active inference, we'll achieve a better

528
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,364
understanding of social conformity and

529
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:13,390
decision making.

530
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,026
Regimes of expectation centers on the

531
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,766
computational construct of deontic

532
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,286
value, which we explained before and

533
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:25,846
aligns with the broader research on

534
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:28,546
social conformity, especially the winner

535
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:30,934
takes all model proposed by Frank in

536
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:32,280
2008.

537
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,406
Social expectation here play a

538
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,962
significant role in shaping human

539
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,570
decisions, and specifically, social

540
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,350
conformity act as a learning strategy

541
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,254
which is effective in uncertain

542
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:48,698
environments. So now that we build on

543
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,814
the foundational role of deontic value

544
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,334
and the regimes of expectation, we find

545
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:56,094
that this computational construct also

546
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,446
serve as a crucial weighing factor in

547
00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,920
individual decision making.

548
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,530
So we'll see how we can put this effect

549
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,180
directly on decision making.

550
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,912
Sorry. Regimes of expectations have

551
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,004
basically a function of fitness

552
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:21,348
enhancing social conformity. It suggests

553
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:23,160
that conforming to social norms has

554
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,112
evolutionary advantages. It leads into

555
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,256
a circular causality between shared

556
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:31,564
Bayesian expectations and individual

557
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:35,212
policy selection. It's consistent with

558
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,124
findings by Sanfi in 2014, which

559
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:40,284
emphasize the importance of norms and

560
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,450
expectations in social decision making.

561
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,246
So now that we have how the environment

562
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,554
and the individual co construct through

563
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,410
these regimes of expectations,

564
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,046
we will find how this allows us to

565
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:59,354
construct a sense of self, specifically

566
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:00,560
the social self.

567
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,466
Here, social norms and shared Bayesian

568
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:07,746
expectations link our individual and

569
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:09,506
collective decision making processes to

570
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,890
the broader understanding of selfhood.

571
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,566
So how does active inference allow us to

572
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,840
model how we derive the sense of self?

573
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,202
Let's start by explaining the three main

574
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:30,282
types of selves, minimal narrative and

575
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:33,578
social. The minimal self

576
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,894
is the prereflexive experience of being

577
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:40,126
a subject emphasizing the body's role in

578
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:41,840
shaping subjective experience.

579
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,670
The narrative self is shaped by personal

580
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,486
stories and experiences. Highlighting

581
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:51,186
the importance of generative models in

582
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:55,502
organizing these experiences aligns

583
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,726
with the active inference, formalism,

584
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:00,306
and psychological desires, providing a

585
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:03,250
coherent narrative that guides our sense

586
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,140
of self across time.

587
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,814
The social self emerges from

588
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:11,894
interactions with others and is

589
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:14,918
influenced by social norms, values,

590
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:17,450
and shared generative models.

591
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,086
This concept is supported by the folk

592
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:24,314
concept of intentionality, which

593
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,402
includes desires, beliefs, intentions,

594
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,150
awareness, and skill.

595
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,494
Understanding these facets of the sense

596
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:34,058
of self through the lens of active

597
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:36,618
inference gives us an integrative

598
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:39,498
cognitive process for emotions and

599
00:26:39,524 --> 00:26:42,846
social interactions. So now we'll

600
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:44,418
delve more into the intricacies of the

601
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:46,974
social self to show that the generative

602
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,734
model and social scripts discussed

603
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:51,330
earlier are integral to its formation.

604
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,414
These scripts, optimized through

605
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,094
extended active inference, not only

606
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,742
guide our social interaction, but also

607
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:59,000
contribute to the shaping of that self,

608
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,990
creating a seamless interplay between

609
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,934
individual cognition and collective

610
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:07,354
social behavior. So,

611
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,226
as we said earlier, social scripts are

612
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:11,126
the cognitive blueprints that guide

613
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:13,974
individuals through a myriad of expected

614
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:16,730
actions or events in social contexts.

615
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,954
These scripts are essentially generative

616
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:21,294
models that help individuals predict and

617
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:24,506
navigate social interactions. They're

618
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:26,046
indispensable. They allow us to

619
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,106
continuously update our internal models

620
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:30,594
to minimize uncertainty and achieve a

621
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:34,046
stable internal state. It's particularly

622
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,522
important in a world where social

623
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:37,806
interactions are increasingly complex

624
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:40,690
and laden with unspoken expectations.

625
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,772
Its optimization serves as a micro level

626
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:48,944
mechanism that complements the macro

627
00:27:48,992 --> 00:27:50,836
level influence of social norms and

628
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,472
deontic values, creating a cohesive

629
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:55,220
understanding of social behavior.

630
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,736
Social scripts can be enshrined in

631
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:01,976
deontic cues, which enable the

632
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,892
environment to learn about the behavior

633
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:05,732
of its inhabitants, effectively

634
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,184
outsourcing the epistemic and pragmatic

635
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:09,804
values of any behavior. As we saw

636
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,060
earlier in cognitive niche construction,

637
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,952
the concept of contextual modulation

638
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:19,356
integrates sensory and motor cues to

639
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,628
influence our actions and decisions,

640
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:23,824
allowing for dynamic adaptation and

641
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:26,400
refinement of generative models.

642
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,346
Through this modulation, we can see how

643
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:35,566
social scripts and norms are shaped and

644
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,446
adapted over time, which promotes the

645
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,394
adaptability in the face of changing

646
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,766
environments of individuals embedded in

647
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:43,790
that environment.

648
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,992
Now, contextual modulation

649
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:53,316
here is pretty important and the

650
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:55,156
mechanism not only refines our

651
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:56,884
generative model, but also provides the

652
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:59,952
adaptive flexibility required in complex

653
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,408
environments, which unites the

654
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:03,956
theoretical underpinnings of active

655
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:05,576
inference with empirical findings on

656
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:06,760
adaptive behavior.

657
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,452
So, according to Francesco Donoruma,

658
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:14,424
action perception is an active

659
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:16,856
inferential process that combines motor

660
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,448
prediction and hypothesis testing

661
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:20,972
crucial for understanding social

662
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,536
scripts. Adaptive social behavior thus

663
00:29:24,568 --> 00:29:26,656
results from the dynamic interplay of

664
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:29,212
socioeffective and socio cognitive

665
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:32,876
processes. Research by Berg

666
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:35,888
Merza provides proof of concept that

667
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,504
social context may alter perception,

668
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,980
enabling more adaptive behavior.

669
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,956
It's also supported by studies that

670
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:47,312
reveal how instinctive behavior circuits

671
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:49,424
in the hypothalamus dynamically encode

672
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:51,512
spatial and sensory cues to drive

673
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:53,320
adaptive social behaviors.

674
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,572
Contextual modulation and social scripts

675
00:29:57,636 --> 00:29:59,896
are integral to adaptive behavior and

676
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:02,616
action perception, which allows us to

677
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,128
show how social interactions are crafted

678
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:07,804
through these different scale. These

679
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:10,520
deep temporal models that integrate

680
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,252
various kinds of priors at different

681
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:16,120
scales. So here, contextual modulation

682
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,336
acts as a linchpin in the integration of

683
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,252
social scripts into the generative

684
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:23,776
models we

685
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:25,344
can now appreciate how generative model

686
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:27,648
and social scripts coalesce to form a

687
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,508
comprehensive framework for

688
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,140
understanding interactions.

689
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,154
So active inference is a nuanced lens to

690
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:44,114
explore how power dynamics shape

691
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:46,070
shared generative models,

692
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,794
thereby influencing the cultural

693
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:53,030
affordances available to individuals.

694
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,966
For instance, epistemic communities

695
00:30:57,158 --> 00:31:00,166
serves as platforms where power dynamics

696
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:03,238
can significantly shape shared beliefs

697
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:06,522
and actions. Through the construction of

698
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:10,234
certain niche, we can see that existing

699
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:13,342
power structure lead to the creation of

700
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:15,422
environments that perpetuate these

701
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,566
structures through certain kinds of

702
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:19,774
scripts, certain kinds of norms, and

703
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,874
through the valence that we associate to

704
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:24,162
our sense of self relative to these

705
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,614
scripts. Cultural affordances

706
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,762
here are dynamically influenced by power

707
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:32,574
tinged asymmetries. These asymmetries

708
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,854
can affect how individuals perceive and

709
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,682
enact social scripts, which further

710
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,606
shapes the cultural affordances that

711
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,790
they encounter.

712
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,646
We see how deeply intertwined cultural

713
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:49,210
affordances are with power dynamics.

714
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,166
It allows us to understand societal

715
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:56,250
structures in more depth.

716
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,346
So when we expand the scope of active

717
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:01,834
inference in cultural affordance

718
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:05,102
negotiation, we can dive into a case

719
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,466
study, that of gender norms and gender

720
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:10,590
fluidity to broader cultural contexts.

721
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,274
This exemplifies the influence of power

722
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:18,126
dynamics. So just as individuals

723
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:19,534
navigate and adapt to cultural

724
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:21,346
affordances that are deeply shaped by

725
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:23,446
societal power structures, they have to

726
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:25,638
navigate gender related affordances that

727
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,000
they also engage with.

728
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,730
So through this, we can also understand

729
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,602
the concept of gender fluidity. Here,

730
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:38,666
generative model play a specific role,

731
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:41,386
which is to adapt to changing societal

732
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,834
norms and gender related affordances.

733
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:45,790
These are cultural affordances.

734
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,786
Dynamic for Maniche construction allows

735
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:52,174
individuals to create and adapt

736
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,934
environments that reflect their evolving

737
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:55,810
gender identity and expression.

738
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,514
The concept of affordance negotiation is

739
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:03,470
particularly relevant here. It refers to

740
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,546
the process by which individuals adapt

741
00:33:06,578 --> 00:33:09,250
their behavior to maximize opportunities

742
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,046
and minimize challenges in their

743
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:14,674
environment. In the context of gender

744
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:16,662
fluidity, it involves navigating complex

745
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,886
social scripts and norms that shape

746
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:20,090
gender expression.

747
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,846
Research suggests that these gender

748
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,754
differences in negotiation are

749
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,366
contextually bound and can be subject to

750
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:31,674
change. By understanding how individuals

751
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,850
navigate these social scripts and norms,

752
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,246
we can, for instance, address the

753
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:37,770
limitations or constraints that affect

754
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,590
expressions of their gender identity.

755
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,306
So here, gender through the lens of

756
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:46,194
active inference as a case study and

757
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,834
affordance negotiation gives us a

758
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:52,130
comprehensive view of the social

759
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,038
psychology and how it can apply to

760
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:56,486
gender studies, for instance. But this

761
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:58,354
is true for many other kinds of cultural

762
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:02,454
phenomena. So we

763
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:03,846
build now on the understanding of how

764
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:05,442
active inference and power dynamics

765
00:34:05,506 --> 00:34:07,210
shape cultural affordances.

766
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,882
We can see how this allows us to

767
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:15,050
understand potentially puzzling actions

768
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,798
which are shaped by social scripts and

769
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:20,586
the dynamics within the epistemic

770
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:23,134
communities they inhabit so we have

771
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:25,086
defined how scripts allow us to

772
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:28,186
interpret different kinds of behaviors

773
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:31,822
and how people navigate their desired

774
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:34,450
outcomes. Given these social scripts,

775
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,354
so what happens when we are faced with

776
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:41,634
puzzling actions? People rely on their

777
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:43,054
generative models to update their

778
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,446
beliefs and expectations. So do we

779
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:47,174
interpret these behaviors based on

780
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,910
inherent traits or situational reasons?

781
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,702
Here, traits and motives interact with

782
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,186
in predicting behaviors, channeling the

783
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,994
behavioral expression through one's life

784
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,074
throughout one's life. On the other

785
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:02,006
hand, contextual cues significantly

786
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:03,306
influence the interpretation of

787
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:05,974
ambiguous behaviors. Social scripts

788
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,546
Guide Our expectation in social

789
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,574
situations can either be adapted when

790
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,782
confronted with unexpected behavior or

791
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,802
allow us to shift from script to script

792
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,886
to have a better prior over what we

793
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,214
might expect next. So,

794
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,546
for instance, this challenge is

795
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:24,034
particularly pronounced for those who

796
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:25,966
diverge from established social norms

797
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,466
and script. Their interpretations are

798
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:29,986
influenced by the dynamics of

799
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,426
information spread within their

800
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:34,626
epistemic communities. Understanding

801
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:36,694
ambiguous social behaviors is not just

802
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,934
about individual cognition, but also

803
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,658
about the social and cultural contexts

804
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,230
that shape our interpretations.

805
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,354
So now we're going to dive from this

806
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,510
point into the specific contextual

807
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,514
factors that further nuance our

808
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:54,694
understanding. Our former discussion

809
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,346
emphasized the influence of power and

810
00:35:56,368 --> 00:35:58,278
social norms, and now we're going to

811
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,854
turn our attention to the impact, say,

812
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,706
of social anxiety, behavioral

813
00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:03,354
flexibility, and goal oriented

814
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:05,006
perception in shaping our

815
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:06,910
interpretations of social behavior.

816
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,250
Understanding social behaviors often

817
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,470
requires an approach that goes beyond

818
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,734
trade based interpretations. Contextual

819
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:18,914
factors like social anxiety can

820
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,990
significantly influence how we interpret

821
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,730
an ambiguous social cue, for instance,

822
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,418
determining the most likely prior,

823
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:28,374
using the most likely prior, rather than

824
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:29,686
being open to other kinds of

825
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:33,314
interpretations. Behavioral flexibility

826
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:35,480
is another crucial aspect to consider.

827
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,806
It allows for adaptability and nuanced

828
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,650
understanding of social behaviors across

829
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,866
different social contexts, such that a

830
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:45,482
same script can be interpreted different

831
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,826
ways through different kinds of

832
00:36:46,848 --> 00:36:50,718
behaviors. The concept of goals here

833
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,302
plays an important role in social

834
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:55,822
perception. They can serve to provide

835
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:59,374
a broad implication or for where

836
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,246
we understand an individual to try to be

837
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:03,314
headed, such that while their lower

838
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,946
level script may be different from the

839
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,686
one we have, their higher level script

840
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:08,130
is still interpretable.

841
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,076
So now we're going to try to see what

842
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,516
can be the outcomes in real life of all

843
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:20,044
these processes. Together, we're going

844
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:22,764
to focus on cognitive mechanisms that

845
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:24,476
underpin social phenomena like

846
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:26,780
confirmation bias and echo chambers.

847
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,628
Building on the concept of active

848
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,868
inference, we explore how individuals

849
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,552
not only interpret ambiguous social

850
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,568
cues, but also actively seek information

851
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,108
that confirm their preexisting belief,

852
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:40,900
thereby shaping epistemic communities.

853
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,634
Confirmation bias is a cognitive

854
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,794
tendency that affects information spread

855
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:53,158
and decision making. It is driven by

856
00:37:53,244 --> 00:37:55,486
agents seeking information that confirms

857
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:58,070
their preexisting belief while avoiding

858
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,986
challenging information. This is an

859
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,066
effective way of using action to

860
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,082
minimize free energy rather than

861
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:07,450
updating beliefs in a costly manner.

862
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,206
Echo chambers amplify this bias by

863
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:14,574
creating self reinforcing loops where

864
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,474
individuals selectively expose

865
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:19,774
themselves to aligned information. So

866
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,134
research indicates that network

867
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:23,006
structures contribute to the persistence

868
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:25,486
of echo chambers, thereby affecting

869
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:27,970
policy making and public discourse.

870
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,290
The minimization of free energy

871
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,442
transfers to the network, thereby

872
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:36,086
shaping the environment. We can see

873
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,326
here how there is a loop where the

874
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:39,846
environment both shapes the individual,

875
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:41,846
who will in turn continuously shape the

876
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:44,782
environment. Interestingly,

877
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:46,806
some studies have identified a reverse

878
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,802
confirmation bias whereby some people

879
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,730
actually do seek out information in an

880
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,126
explorative manner, which again aligns

881
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:58,474
with this idea of active inference.

882
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:02,542
Epistemic value and here we may try

883
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:04,926
to ponder why certain people are more

884
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:06,618
likely to break out of their echo

885
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:09,662
chambers rather than stay in them.

886
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:12,814
This may align, potentially with deep

887
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:14,882
temporal models, whereas we can see

888
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:19,138
value at a later

889
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,666
point in time and perhaps focus more on

890
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:24,982
this expected value rather than on

891
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,994
the direct value of the confirmation

892
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:27,830
bias.

893
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,358
To mitigate such biases, we can use

894
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:35,486
strategies such as fostering epistemic

895
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:38,154
change through diverging information and

896
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:42,054
encouraging reflection to break apart

897
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:46,134
echo chambers. Now we've

898
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,086
explored a little bit confirmation bias

899
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:51,360
and echo chamber. We can see how this

900
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,590
extends to human communication.

901
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,866
This allows us to explore the principles

902
00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:59,942
of active inference, which shape

903
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:01,986
individual cognitive tendencies, and the

904
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:04,226
influence of the broader dynamics of

905
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:05,326
communication and collective

906
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:07,170
intelligence on the environment.

907
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,066
So we can link communicative behavior to

908
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:14,534
biological imperative of minimizing free

909
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:16,866
energy, which emphasizes the action

910
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:20,006
oriented nature of communication. The

911
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:21,970
framework allows for adaptive behavior

912
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,662
even when the models deviate from

913
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,746
vertical representations of the

914
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:30,922
environment. So how do we justify that

915
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,874
people lie or that people say

916
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,406
things which don't seem to align

917
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,762
properly with what everybody else seems

918
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,182
to believe about the environment?

919
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:42,666
Effectively, this is an action. You're

920
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:44,766
trying to push a belief onto the

921
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:46,398
environment such that there is a

922
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:48,126
potential for the environments to be

923
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:50,194
shaped in a way that evidences your

924
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:54,274
beliefs. So we can think

925
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:56,660
of cognitive control here,

926
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,738
whereby active inference has an

927
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,322
effective goal, maintenance in working

928
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:03,394
memory. It provides top down guidance

929
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:05,890
for overt behavior, moving beyond

930
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,786
stereotyped responses. Our understanding

931
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:10,854
of communication is enriched by

932
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:12,914
introducing neurobiologically plausible

933
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:16,534
computational hypotheses. The ecological

934
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:18,618
approach to active inference is a

935
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:21,546
framework that understands the

936
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:23,782
complexities of human communication

937
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:26,906
across different scales. It explores how

938
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:28,794
individuals contribute to the collective

939
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:30,974
intelligence of a group or society by

940
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:33,294
fostering a collaborative approach that

941
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:36,350
leverages diverse skills and knowledge.

942
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,754
This is one of the reasons echo chambers

943
00:41:39,802 --> 00:41:42,306
are maintained they're efficient in the

944
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:44,446
transmission of information and promote

945
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:46,974
collaboration among agents who overtly

946
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:48,020
share a model.

947
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,382
So now we're going to look at a more

948
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:56,274
detailed understanding of ecological

949
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:58,790
dimensions of this discourse.

950
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,478
Context, as we saw earlier, plays a

951
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:06,202
crucial role in the activation of

952
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,822
predictive inferences, which offers

953
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:10,454
further support for ecological

954
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:13,526
approaches. Active inference models

955
00:42:13,638 --> 00:42:15,274
contain terms that encode both the

956
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:17,526
object of desire and the strength of

957
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,734
desire at the psychological level. So

958
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,474
the context of enactive inference

959
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:24,314
suggests that generative and recognition

960
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:26,826
models are best cast as realizing

961
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,334
inference and control under the free

962
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:31,666
energy principle. So in

963
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,426
this way, communication through the

964
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:36,014
active inference lens gives us an action

965
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:38,206
oriented nature of cooperative

966
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,482
communication, where together we

967
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:42,726
mutually craft our models such that we

968
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:45,350
can achieve a common goal.

969
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,334
So now and lastly, let's dive into

970
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:54,262
a very short overview of how this may

971
00:42:54,316 --> 00:42:56,330
translate to language processing.

972
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,606
So remember, we discussed deep temporal

973
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:03,094
models here. They enable us to explore

974
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:05,686
the sequential dynamics of language

975
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:09,146
processing. The models are hierarchical,

976
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,866
where inference at higher levels informs

977
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:14,430
the selection of words at lower levels.

978
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,566
This hierarchical structure allows for

979
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:20,166
the accumulation of evidence over nested

980
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:23,346
timescales. One key aspect is the

981
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,074
emergence of behavioral and

982
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:27,474
neurophysiological correlates in those

983
00:43:27,512 --> 00:43:29,934
sequential dynamics. Like the Theta

984
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,534
gamma couplings that we discussed

985
00:43:31,582 --> 00:43:34,840
earlier. It's a phenomenon that again

986
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,554
was observed and allows us to measure

987
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:41,506
belief updating under variational

988
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:44,546
message passing. Thus,

989
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,726
generative models aren't just predictive

990
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,146
but also explanatory. They can help us

991
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,682
understand neural mechanisms like

992
00:43:50,736 --> 00:43:52,170
language comprehension.

993
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,296
So in cognitive control, linguistic can

994
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:58,908
be scoused as individual agents

995
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,676
contributing to this intelligence of the

996
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:03,956
group. And the research shows that

997
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,636
generative models are central to the

998
00:44:05,658 --> 00:44:07,556
perception and interpretation of the

999
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:11,132
linguistic signals. We have a structural

1000
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,464
understanding of sequences of words and

1001
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:15,800
their context sensitivity.

1002
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,276
This enables the agent to resolve

1003
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:20,420
uncertainty about the underlying

1004
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,296
conceptual, semantic or lexical causes

1005
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:25,980
of sensory input.

1006
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,028
It can incorporate beliefs about

1007
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:32,476
narratives, the type of question, the

1008
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:34,776
scenic state of the world, a semiotic

1009
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:36,416
factor indicating the topic of

1010
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:39,644
discussion. These factors generate

1011
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:41,536
expectations for the lower level, such

1012
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:43,600
as syntax and semantics.

1013
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,224
Models enable inference through this

1014
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,528
deep temp structure about the narrative,

1015
00:44:50,704 --> 00:44:52,740
such as those seen in reading.

1016
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,170
Here, the neural processes can be

1017
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,058
understood in terms of simulating the

1018
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:03,446
epistemic origin seen in reading and

1019
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:05,270
other language related activities.

1020
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,462
So, to conclude, we have

1021
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:14,374
seen comprehensive understanding of

1022
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:17,034
active inference, inactivism and their

1023
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:19,318
interplay in shaping social cognition

1024
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:22,582
behavior. We have explored various

1025
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:24,506
philosophical perspectives such as the

1026
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:26,358
inactive affordance based perspective,

1027
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:28,634
the helmholtzium Beijing model, and

1028
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:30,414
highlighted their contribution to

1029
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:32,510
understanding our social interactions.

1030
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,206
We've explored deep temporal models as a

1031
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:37,994
potent computational tool for modeling

1032
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:40,078
complex time dependent patterns in

1033
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,806
social cognition, such as in language.

1034
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,706
As well, we've discussed the role of

1035
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,282
mirror neurons, emphasizing their

1036
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:49,134
potential centrality in continuously

1037
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:50,546
updating internal models of the

1038
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:52,286
environment and their significance in

1039
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:56,546
social cognition. We discussed

1040
00:45:56,578 --> 00:45:59,446
potential future directions for research

1041
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,590
if you are interested in these topics.

1042
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,106
So, here, the interplay between active

1043
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,062
inference and activism. Computational

1044
00:46:07,126 --> 00:46:09,674
models, like deep temporal models, give

1045
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:11,754
us a multidimensional view of social

1046
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:15,226
cognition and agency. It broadens the

1047
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:16,954
scope of research, but also brings us

1048
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:19,854
closer to our goal of understanding the

1049
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:22,590
complex cognitive and social phenomena.

1050
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,742
So, for next class, I offer you

1051
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:32,194
an opportunity. You should pick

1052
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:35,058
a text from this session from the

1053
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,722
references that will be made available,

1054
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:39,298
or one that you find yourself in the

1055
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:42,226
literature, read it,

1056
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:45,526
and try to explain how it ties to the

1057
00:46:45,548 --> 00:46:47,480
concepts that we explored today.

1058
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,006
Ideally, you can present it to the

1059
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:52,966
group, take five minutes, explain what

1060
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:55,338
the text says and how it connects to the

1061
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:58,074
contents of the course. If you have any

1062
00:46:58,112 --> 00:47:00,474
questions, we can potentially take them

1063
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:01,100
now.

1064
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,470
Thank you, Mao. That was epic.

1065
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,498
All right, well, people can write

1066
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,602
questions in the chat. I'll just read

1067
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:19,420
one. All right.

1068
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,340
Where does identity and ideology fit.

1069
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,114
In my presentation or in the framework

1070
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:31,918
that I'm presenting? So I'm going to

1071
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:33,310
assume it's in the framework.

1072
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,682
Identity fits as a social self, right?

1073
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:40,974
Identity is literally how you craft

1074
00:47:41,022 --> 00:47:43,662
yourselfhood relative to the narratives

1075
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:46,866
that you're given. So it's precisely the

1076
00:47:46,888 --> 00:47:49,530
social self that we discussed. Ideology

1077
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,350
corresponds to a looser,

1078
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,094
let's say, weak script that allows you

1079
00:47:57,132 --> 00:48:01,314
to shift the valence of certain values

1080
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:05,062
across certain norms. So, let's assume

1081
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:08,842
that you understand values as

1082
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:11,562
a higher or lower probability for a type

1083
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:15,130
of level behavior.

1084
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,078
So, I value kindness. There'll be a high

1085
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:21,434
prior over kindness, and therefore,

1086
00:48:21,562 --> 00:48:25,134
the paths, the policies that lead to

1087
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:28,414
what I ascribe to as kindness will

1088
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:30,386
therefore become more likely to be

1089
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,466
adopted and will become a norm if more

1090
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:35,442
of us value the same thing. The key

1091
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,466
issue here is, how do I associate the

1092
00:48:38,488 --> 00:48:42,200
semantics of kindness to the actual

1093
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,722
pragmatic representations and actions

1094
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:48,646
that correspond to what I believe to be

1095
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:50,294
kindness? And this is where the co

1096
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:52,294
construction happens, right? We

1097
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,614
communicate together, and I'm going to

1098
00:48:54,652 --> 00:48:57,866
say, this is kindness. I'm acting on the

1099
00:48:57,888 --> 00:49:00,346
world to determine. Now, this is what we

1100
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:02,202
will believe to be kindness. And I value

1101
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:04,154
kindness very highly because that's my

1102
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,526
ideology, and therefore, this is what we

1103
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:08,190
should be doing. All these things

1104
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,218
connect together through the interaction

1105
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,154
of the environment. The symbols

1106
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,094
encrusted in the environment that I

1107
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:15,694
share and co construct through

1108
00:49:15,732 --> 00:49:16,670
communication.

1109
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,274
Wow. And how

1110
00:49:22,312 --> 00:49:25,054
does that have an impact on affordances?

1111
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:27,060
Was the follow up question there.

1112
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,158
So if we go back to the part of the

1113
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:33,480
course about affordances, we saw that

1114
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,834
certain things are made more likely

1115
00:49:36,962 --> 00:49:39,080
given the niche that you are in.

1116
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,134
If you understand the onto cues, you see

1117
00:49:42,172 --> 00:49:45,254
that there's going to be some signals

1118
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:47,306
that pull you as attractors in a

1119
00:49:47,328 --> 00:49:50,026
specific direction. So let's assume that

1120
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:52,042
we have an ideology, again, that

1121
00:49:52,096 --> 00:49:54,930
promotes kindness in the environment.

1122
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,010
It is highly likely that potential

1123
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,878
pathways towards kindness will be made

1124
00:50:01,044 --> 00:50:03,870
more available. So, for instance,

1125
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,190
let's assume that we believe that giving

1126
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,894
money to people is kindness.

1127
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:12,114
There's going to be more initiatives for

1128
00:50:12,152 --> 00:50:14,178
you to give money. So, for instance, I

1129
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:15,346
don't know if you guys have taken the

1130
00:50:15,368 --> 00:50:19,154
plane recently, but Air Canada has

1131
00:50:19,192 --> 00:50:23,474
started program where

1132
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:24,830
if you have loose change in your

1133
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,998
pockets, you can put it in the seat in

1134
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:29,414
front of you in a little pocket thing

1135
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:30,726
and you can put the money there and

1136
00:50:30,748 --> 00:50:33,286
they're going to donate it. Now, I'm not

1137
00:50:33,308 --> 00:50:34,854
saying that's kindness. We can argue

1138
00:50:34,902 --> 00:50:36,778
about the politics of it all and the

1139
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,914
tax, et cetera, but this is an

1140
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:41,980
affordance that wasn't there before,

1141
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,666
and now it's in my environment now. I

1142
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:47,502
don't have to take it, but it's now more

1143
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:49,774
readily available for me to actually act

1144
00:50:49,812 --> 00:50:52,014
on it. And you can see this across every

1145
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:54,490
level. It's just that most affordances

1146
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,774
are invisible to us as affordances. We

1147
00:50:57,812 --> 00:51:00,430
just react to them. We just exist within

1148
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,954
them, but we don't consider they

1149
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,546
wouldn't be there, such as a bathroom in

1150
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:06,626
a house. This is one of the things that

1151
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:08,660
allows us to think more critically about

1152
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,066
what it means to be homeless. Like to

1153
00:51:12,088 --> 00:51:13,458
you, it seems obvious when you need to

1154
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:14,518
go to the bathroom, you'll go to the

1155
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:15,634
bathroom, right? There's a bathroom

1156
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:18,070
available to you, but there isn't one

1157
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,358
for people who live outside because they

1158
00:51:20,364 --> 00:51:21,938
don't have a home. And yet we've

1159
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,614
criminalized the act of relieving

1160
00:51:24,662 --> 00:51:26,618
yourself outside. So we've basically

1161
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:30,166
said, well, don't pee. Or if you pee,

1162
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:31,882
well, you're now a criminal. So being

1163
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:35,130
homeless by virtue of not having access

1164
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,306
to the same affordances means it's

1165
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:39,422
effectively criminal to be homeless. So

1166
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,360
these are the kinds of ways that

1167
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,686
ideology shapes our affordances and

1168
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,134
effectively pulls us in a state of

1169
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:49,602
attraction and effectively in different

1170
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:52,274
states of power as well. Because we

1171
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:54,882
collectively have decided that the only

1172
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:57,554
people who get to have the right to

1173
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:59,266
certain affordances are the people who

1174
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:00,802
have enough money to live in a house.

1175
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,370
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1176
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,166
Thanks. There's a lot there. All right,

1177
00:52:07,188 --> 00:52:08,654
I'll read a comment. This is something

1178
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,326
you could address right now, or save it

1179
00:52:11,348 --> 00:52:13,118
for the discussion or however you want.

1180
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:16,274
Michael wrote, would you be open to

1181
00:52:16,312 --> 00:52:18,818
attempting to map a social or personal

1182
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:21,426
narrative rather than another element in

1183
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:23,538
the literature, E. G. Translating the

1184
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,890
hero's journey or twelve step recovery?

1185
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,222
I'm not sure I understand. Attempting to

1186
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:33,110
map. Connect the

1187
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:37,254
active ontology informalisms to a

1188
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:41,178
more broadly understood narrative or

1189
00:52:41,264 --> 00:52:44,700
specific script. Yeah,

1190
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:52,894
big fan of the hero's journey. But why

1191
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:54,960
do we want, say,

1192
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,738
why do we feel like the hero's journey

1193
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:02,378
in itself is valuable? We feel that it's

1194
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:05,458
valuable because we feel that it

1195
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:09,282
is a very easy explanation for why

1196
00:53:09,336 --> 00:53:12,370
somebody would have value. And it is

1197
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,694
usually easy to minimize

1198
00:53:15,742 --> 00:53:17,318
free energy through. Well, there's a

1199
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,642
clear path. Right. This person wasn't

1200
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:23,938
the result of very complex interactions

1201
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,986
of the environment or whatever. It's

1202
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:28,838
actually, no, it's all him. He just

1203
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:30,886
understood the. He understood what he

1204
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,746
had to do. He figured out what he had to

1205
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:34,426
do. And there you go. He was able to do

1206
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:38,540
it. And so this is a signal for perfect

1207
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,066
fitness to the landscape, right. It's

1208
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,840
perfect cognitive grip. So it's like

1209
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,814
there's an underlying assumption that

1210
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:52,640
this one person was able to update their

1211
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,340
generative model sufficiently such that

1212
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:59,410
they were perfectly able to grab every

1213
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,314
affordance that the environment gave

1214
00:54:01,352 --> 00:54:04,754
them to go towards their

1215
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:06,846
state objective. So in terms of active

1216
00:54:06,878 --> 00:54:08,126
inference, it's pretty simple. It's

1217
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:10,198
someone that has the capacity to go from

1218
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:13,094
a very unfit generative model to a very

1219
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:15,046
fit generative model relative to the

1220
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,886
environment. And so we like that

1221
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:18,342
narrative because it's like, okay,

1222
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:20,058
well, then that means everybody can do

1223
00:54:20,064 --> 00:54:24,874
it, right? If we can go from being

1224
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:27,706
a failure to being a hero, and all we

1225
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:31,142
have to do is take one or two hardships

1226
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:34,334
and go through it, then it's possible.

1227
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:37,214
Now, there's also some deification here,

1228
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:38,954
right? Because usually the hero's

1229
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:41,918
journey goes through some very difficult

1230
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:43,786
elements and comes out on the other

1231
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:47,602
side. And we assume that because they

1232
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:50,046
can, there's a rationale of meritocracy,

1233
00:54:50,158 --> 00:54:54,814
which is the world is relatively

1234
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,914
equal for everybody. So it tries to pull

1235
00:54:56,952 --> 00:55:00,066
away from every other power factor,

1236
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:02,662
ecological factor, and it's like, no,

1237
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:05,462
it's all about how you're able to fix

1238
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:06,886
your generative model to do the right

1239
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:09,958
things that you have to do. So that's

1240
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,738
why I'm not a fan of it. But I hope.

1241
00:55:11,904 --> 00:55:13,354
Was this the mapping you were looking

1242
00:55:13,392 --> 00:55:16,060
for in terms of active inference and

1243
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,660
reenergy minimization kind of thing.

1244
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,506
Here's one thought on that. The hero's

1245
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:29,002
journey or another archetypal attractor,

1246
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:32,974
just archetype or just thread that

1247
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:35,486
way. It embeds a concise narrative

1248
00:55:35,518 --> 00:55:38,834
account that is made legible through

1249
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:41,140
storytelling that we can understand.

1250
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,706
And it embodies not just kind

1251
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:47,958
of mythical things, but also like real

1252
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,746
structural implicit

1253
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:53,846
features. That's why some stories can be

1254
00:55:53,868 --> 00:55:56,150
so short and so transferable across

1255
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,034
contexts, because they abstract, but

1256
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:01,274
also it's what they do include in those

1257
00:56:01,312 --> 00:56:03,594
cases. And then you talked about how

1258
00:56:03,632 --> 00:56:06,140
that conveys something about value,

1259
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:10,534
which is what supports social norms

1260
00:56:10,582 --> 00:56:13,166
and social values, which of course, you

1261
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:15,630
can't point at anywhere.

1262
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,590
Yet what can you say about what are

1263
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:24,114
social norms or forces or what is the

1264
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:24,740
social?

1265
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,980
What is the social?

1266
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,530
Um.

1267
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,686
I think you can point to it. I think you

1268
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,998
can effectively point to processes, you

1269
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:46,210
can point to material realities,

1270
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,670
institutions.

1271
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,418
I think we tend to use

1272
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:59,302
the notion of the social to contrast

1273
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,660
it with the notion of the individual.

1274
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,614
It's just that nothing's ever that

1275
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:08,014
simple. The individual is always

1276
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:12,378
built because of other individuals.

1277
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,070
So there's no really such thing as

1278
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,282
uninvival. You're always embedded within

1279
00:57:17,336 --> 00:57:19,940
something. So the real question is,

1280
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,250
what's the scale that you're interested

1281
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,894
in, and what is identifiable

1282
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:29,494
as what may be within or without or

1283
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:31,334
outside of your control within that

1284
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:34,758
scale. And we generally make a

1285
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:37,734
sort of conflation between what is

1286
00:57:37,772 --> 00:57:40,262
social and what is uncontrollable. Even

1287
00:57:40,316 --> 00:57:41,962
that's not necessarily true, as we saw,

1288
00:57:42,016 --> 00:57:44,870
right. Because through our actions,

1289
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,180
which can be verbal, which can be

1290
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,158
physical, we reiterate

1291
00:57:51,254 --> 00:57:55,262
or push on what

1292
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:57,534
constitutes what is valued by other

1293
00:57:57,572 --> 00:58:01,246
actors within the same locality. So if

1294
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:04,110
you're asking what constitutes culture,

1295
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,694
well, at the level of my house,

1296
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:11,154
culture is we go to bed around ten

1297
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:13,138
to eleven. Because if you don't go to

1298
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:14,866
bed at eleven, you're going to make

1299
00:58:14,888 --> 00:58:16,370
noise and you're going to wake me up.

1300
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,446
So our shared culture is this. This is

1301
00:58:19,468 --> 00:58:21,254
something that we repeat over time that

1302
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,382
constitutes an attractor for more than

1303
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:26,694
just me. If I look at the level of my

1304
00:58:26,732 --> 00:58:30,678
building, nobody puts plants outside

1305
00:58:30,764 --> 00:58:32,294
on their balcony. If it's at the level

1306
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:35,606
of Montreal, there's potholes

1307
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:36,886
everYwhere. And we're not bitching

1308
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:38,246
really about it, we've all accepted

1309
00:58:38,278 --> 00:58:39,478
there's potholes everywhere. So it's

1310
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:41,178
part of our culture, it becomes part of

1311
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,174
our conscious. And so why is it

1312
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:48,094
cultural? It's because we can see

1313
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:51,914
that this behavior, these expectations,

1314
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,814
translate not just to you, to your own

1315
00:58:54,852 --> 00:58:56,366
model, but it translates to the model of

1316
00:58:56,388 --> 00:58:58,138
other people as well, and they can

1317
00:58:58,164 --> 00:59:00,210
expect the same for you. It's something

1318
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,866
which is definitely shared. So I think

1319
00:59:02,888 --> 00:59:04,914
you can easily point to things once you

1320
00:59:04,952 --> 00:59:07,294
define the scale at which it becomes

1321
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:08,210
manifest.

1322
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,492
Thanks. Really interesting. All right,

1323
00:59:13,546 --> 00:59:16,260
a question from Upcycle Club, who wrote,

1324
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,824
in terms of the philosophical dimensions

1325
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:22,180
of agency in active inference,

1326
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,880
what is the role of self referentiality?

1327
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,028
I think you'd have to define the term,

1328
00:59:29,044 --> 00:59:30,760
but if I understand correctly,

1329
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,548
we saw that you have to both model

1330
00:59:35,634 --> 00:59:38,364
yourself and model the rest of the world

1331
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:42,252
in order to understand whether your

1332
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:45,400
actions are likely to have the effects

1333
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,092
you want to have on the world. So this

1334
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:49,952
self referentiality, if I understand

1335
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,384
correctly, but I could be wrong, is this

1336
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,688
notion of accurately modeling yourself

1337
00:59:54,774 --> 00:59:58,050
as that? Does that answer the question?

1338
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,710
Yeah. All right. A question from

1339
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,084
Michael, who wrote, I work with

1340
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:07,876
marginalized communities who experience

1341
01:00:07,978 --> 01:00:10,884
the larger culture as dominant and

1342
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:14,680
scientifically enabled. How should such

1343
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,496
communities fortify themselves against

1344
01:00:17,678 --> 01:00:20,760
the more skillful extractive cultures?

1345
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,676
I mean, that's the main question

1346
01:00:27,778 --> 01:00:30,700
that's been for countercultures forever.

1347
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,672
It depends what you mean by fortify

1348
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:39,600
yourself. If you mean be less

1349
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,890
likely to be extracted from,

1350
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,204
I think the question is being extracted

1351
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:47,952
from without getting something in

1352
01:00:48,006 --> 01:00:51,044
return. Because effectively, as you saw,

1353
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:54,132
for coordination to happen, you must

1354
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:57,012
provide something for the group in order

1355
01:00:57,066 --> 01:01:00,096
for the group to move further. So it's

1356
01:01:00,128 --> 01:01:02,276
always a little bit extractive. You will

1357
01:01:02,298 --> 01:01:04,952
always expend some degree of free energy

1358
01:01:05,086 --> 01:01:07,208
in order to move towards the policy that

1359
01:01:07,214 --> 01:01:09,224
you've chosen as a group. So there's two

1360
01:01:09,262 --> 01:01:12,024
elements here, chosen as a group,

1361
01:01:12,222 --> 01:01:14,708
and there should be a return on that as

1362
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:16,892
well. Right? It shouldn't be just, you

1363
01:01:16,946 --> 01:01:19,052
pay, nobody else gives you something.

1364
01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:21,180
So it's the degree to which the system

1365
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,932
minimizes everybody's free energy rather

1366
01:01:23,986 --> 01:01:27,016
than minimizes this group's. And this

1367
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,600
group is still a high free energy, low

1368
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:32,348
allostatic, high allostatic load, et

1369
01:01:32,364 --> 01:01:35,904
cetera. I'm not

1370
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,548
the expert on that specifically. I'm

1371
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:38,944
sure there are people who have worked

1372
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:40,868
with marginalized group way more than I

1373
01:01:40,874 --> 01:01:43,104
have who could give you better insights.

1374
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:47,156
But from what I've read, and if

1375
01:01:47,178 --> 01:01:48,976
I can derive from the theory that we've

1376
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:49,990
presented today,

1377
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:56,360
you need to have a strong narrative that

1378
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:59,864
supports your capacity to

1379
01:01:59,902 --> 01:02:02,728
increase your fitness landscape and

1380
01:02:02,814 --> 01:02:05,724
increases and maintains the bonds, the

1381
01:02:05,762 --> 01:02:07,870
mark of blanket around your group.

1382
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,196
If your group is likely to dissolve all

1383
01:02:11,218 --> 01:02:16,664
the time, if it's constantly threatened

1384
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:19,136
and shaky, it's not going to be able to

1385
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:21,024
go very far, it's always going to be in

1386
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:25,116
protective mode. So you need to ensure

1387
01:02:25,148 --> 01:02:27,344
that the group has strong bonds, that

1388
01:02:27,382 --> 01:02:29,780
the group can expand, and that the group

1389
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:34,020
can together enact policies that

1390
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,140
lead it to minimizing free energy. And

1391
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:40,070
relative to the larger group,

1392
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,232
that generally entails having more and

1393
01:02:44,286 --> 01:02:47,672
more connections with individuals from

1394
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:52,696
the larger group, such that you

1395
01:02:52,718 --> 01:02:56,056
are capable of changing

1396
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:59,676
their model little by little. You want

1397
01:02:59,698 --> 01:03:02,024
to have a strong boundary, but you don't

1398
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:04,396
want to be unable to communicate with

1399
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,896
the external group, because if you do

1400
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:10,144
that, you can't communicate and co

1401
01:03:10,182 --> 01:03:14,864
construct. So it seems

1402
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:17,484
trivial, but it's developing allyships,

1403
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:19,756
where you have people from the larger

1404
01:03:19,788 --> 01:03:21,904
group that become people, that adopt

1405
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:24,484
your message and allow the expansion of

1406
01:03:24,522 --> 01:03:26,676
your group and the ideology or the

1407
01:03:26,698 --> 01:03:28,356
generative model of your group to be

1408
01:03:28,378 --> 01:03:31,316
integrated within what determines the

1409
01:03:31,338 --> 01:03:32,856
policies of the higher level group, or

1410
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:34,596
at least of the dominant extractive

1411
01:03:34,628 --> 01:03:37,892
group. I hope this helps. I know it's

1412
01:03:38,036 --> 01:03:41,032
not as concrete as one might want,

1413
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:43,896
but I'm sure people with much more

1414
01:03:43,918 --> 01:03:45,836
experience in these fields would have

1415
01:03:45,858 --> 01:03:47,470
much better answers for you.

1416
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,892
I have a question that I've long

1417
01:03:54,946 --> 01:03:56,460
had about some of your different

1418
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,236
research projects which you presented

1419
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:01,330
here. Often there's this

1420
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,904
modeling of both the view from the

1421
01:04:03,942 --> 01:04:06,800
inside with phenomenology,

1422
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,410
and also a view from the outside.

1423
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,560
So what can you say about active

1424
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,524
inference and that? What does that

1425
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,956
mean? Where does that come from? How

1426
01:04:19,978 --> 01:04:21,776
does that matter for the personal and

1427
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:22,570
the social?

1428
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,870
So imagine a mark of blanket.

1429
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,646
Every mark of blanket entails there's an

1430
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,806
outside and an inside. Now you can

1431
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,178
always redraw it. You can always

1432
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:39,810
consider it's wider, smaller.

1433
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,194
Inside your mark of blankets, there are

1434
01:04:42,232 --> 01:04:43,906
mark of blankets. It's all mark of

1435
01:04:43,928 --> 01:04:47,074
blankets, all the way down. So this

1436
01:04:47,112 --> 01:04:50,470
notion of internal and external is only

1437
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,686
useful in relation to the measurement of

1438
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,960
a joint probability. That's it.

1439
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,320
It's not ontological. In a sense,

1440
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:08,682
I can consider that my cells also have

1441
01:05:08,736 --> 01:05:10,406
like an internal model and an external

1442
01:05:10,438 --> 01:05:14,282
model, and I'm just some emergent scale.

1443
01:05:14,426 --> 01:05:17,022
Given the connection between all these

1444
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:18,334
models that have an internal and

1445
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,360
external model,

1446
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,806
this group right now has a mark of

1447
01:05:23,828 --> 01:05:26,414
blankets, which means us. We have

1448
01:05:26,452 --> 01:05:28,174
spoken, and people who have not spoken

1449
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:30,114
to us do not have access to this

1450
01:05:30,152 --> 01:05:31,986
information here. And in order to

1451
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:33,490
exchange information, they'll probably

1452
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,940
have to speak to some of us. And so

1453
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,418
there'll be an action that we put upon

1454
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:43,206
the world as a group with some degree of

1455
01:05:43,228 --> 01:05:47,606
cohesion over time. So I think we

1456
01:05:47,628 --> 01:05:49,922
have to understand internal and external

1457
01:05:49,986 --> 01:05:52,460
really in those terms, in terms of

1458
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,746
temporality and objective outside

1459
01:05:56,848 --> 01:05:59,930
of that. These are illusory boundaries.

1460
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,418
They're not real. And because they're

1461
01:06:03,434 --> 01:06:05,360
not real, we can sort of issue

1462
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:10,414
essentialism. If a boundary can always

1463
01:06:10,452 --> 01:06:12,766
be redrawn relative to some kind of

1464
01:06:12,788 --> 01:06:16,106
observer, then everything is always

1465
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:18,994
observer relative. And there is no such

1466
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:21,154
thing as a thing which is a thing in

1467
01:06:21,192 --> 01:06:23,406
itself. It's always relational, it's

1468
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:26,766
always phenomenal. And how does this tie

1469
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:28,520
to phenomenality? Well,

1470
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,126
because we are talking through this mark

1471
01:06:33,148 --> 01:06:35,106
of blanket, because we're like, we don't

1472
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:38,246
actually have access to the rest of

1473
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:40,630
the world except through this boundary.

1474
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:44,790
The internal model is what effectively

1475
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,642
wiggles relative to the external world.

1476
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:51,910
And therefore, you get phenomenality

1477
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,226
from this remodeling of the external

1478
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:59,054
world from this given boundary. So,

1479
01:06:59,092 --> 01:07:03,114
for instance, our group's phenomenality

1480
01:07:03,162 --> 01:07:05,686
of everybody else is our shared

1481
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:07,650
representation of who that even means,

1482
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,306
of what that even means. We have this

1483
01:07:10,408 --> 01:07:13,570
phenomenal representation of that group.

1484
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:19,122
We could even potentially create symbols

1485
01:07:19,186 --> 01:07:21,126
for them. We could create actual

1486
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:23,702
representations which would become kind

1487
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:27,846
of what would constitutes qualia at

1488
01:07:27,868 --> 01:07:30,726
the level of our group. So, yeah, I

1489
01:07:30,748 --> 01:07:32,086
think I've answered your question. I get

1490
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:34,886
lost in my thoughts sometimes, but it's

1491
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:36,858
great. All right, I'm going to read a

1492
01:07:36,864 --> 01:07:39,126
comment from Abel, who just requested

1493
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:41,770
this comment to be read. Avel wrote,

1494
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,886
I'd like to add some things about the

1495
01:07:43,908 --> 01:07:46,522
ideology question. You have a diversity

1496
01:07:46,586 --> 01:07:48,766
of definitions of ideology. For the

1497
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:50,538
purposes of the demonstration, I'll

1498
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:53,742
cluster them into two. One, post

1499
01:07:53,796 --> 01:07:55,614
structuralist. In this context, an

1500
01:07:55,652 --> 01:07:57,906
ideology is any system of value or of

1501
01:07:57,928 --> 01:07:59,426
instrumentation of the world. This is

1502
01:07:59,448 --> 01:08:01,602
the definition Mao used. In this case,

1503
01:08:01,656 --> 01:08:03,538
everything is ideology, because the

1504
01:08:03,544 --> 01:08:06,098
basic way we perceive the world is value

1505
01:08:06,184 --> 01:08:09,266
ridden. And two, structuralist.

1506
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:12,054
In this context, an ideology is a system

1507
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:14,390
of discourse that dominates a given

1508
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,314
social context. For structuralist

1509
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:19,670
definitions to apply, you need a lot

1510
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,626
more than shared values. You need a

1511
01:08:21,648 --> 01:08:24,314
clergy that maintains and diffuses the

1512
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:26,634
specific discourse underlying the

1513
01:08:26,672 --> 01:08:29,658
ideology. I have a limited insight in

1514
01:08:29,664 --> 01:08:31,786
the historical evidence, but as of my

1515
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,126
understanding, ideology as factor of

1516
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,046
mass mobilization is pretty much an

1517
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:38,190
early modern particularism.

1518
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,418
I feel like that's if we cast it in

1519
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:52,500
terms of active inference, it would be

1520
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,450
the active states, right? Like you need.

1521
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,746
You need something which acts upon the

1522
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,214
world in order to create the self

1523
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:03,718
evidencing you require. And that would

1524
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:06,086
be like the clergy, right? You need to

1525
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,846
push these beliefs onto the world. You

1526
01:09:07,868 --> 01:09:09,814
can't just sort of let them happen.

1527
01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:11,566
Especially if we talk about precision,

1528
01:09:11,618 --> 01:09:13,322
right? Because, remember, everything

1529
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,046
Wiggles. Everything's always non

1530
01:09:15,078 --> 01:09:16,826
stationary. We move, we change, we

1531
01:09:16,848 --> 01:09:18,646
interpret, we reinterpret those degrees

1532
01:09:18,678 --> 01:09:21,514
of uncertainty. So how do we make sure

1533
01:09:21,632 --> 01:09:24,686
that we continue over time, that we

1534
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,842
don't just dilute, that our boundary

1535
01:09:26,986 --> 01:09:28,598
stays very strong? That's what I was

1536
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,926
discussing earlier with the groups that

1537
01:09:30,948 --> 01:09:33,886
want to be avoid extractivism. You need

1538
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,142
to proselytize. You need to make sure

1539
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:39,098
that the same narratives we return, we

1540
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:40,926
always return to that same narrative.

1541
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:44,126
And how, if we look at the clergy,

1542
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,098
for instance, I don't know if it was a

1543
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,562
mistake or not, but for a time, the only

1544
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,694
way to preach was in Latin, which means

1545
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:53,830
the only way to access the word of God

1546
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,200
was through these people who not only

1547
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,398
had to give you the word of God, but

1548
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,930
they also controlled what it meant.

1549
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,826
Because you don't speak Latin. I don't

1550
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:04,986
speak Latin. I'm going to believe you.

1551
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:08,314
You have that knowledge. So it

1552
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:10,282
goes back to these structures of power,

1553
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,282
where there are some people that have

1554
01:10:12,336 --> 01:10:15,198
more access to influencing others,

1555
01:10:15,284 --> 01:10:17,134
right. They can push their beliefs with

1556
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,358
more precision on others, and others

1557
01:10:19,444 --> 01:10:21,486
just kind of have to follow because they

1558
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:25,834
have no real way to themselves interpret

1559
01:10:25,882 --> 01:10:27,398
and potentially shift narrative

1560
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:28,020
themselves.

1561
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,666
When you do that, I feel like I'm

1562
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:38,622
pretty. There's a lot there. One part

1563
01:10:38,676 --> 01:10:43,140
that I thought was very interesting was

1564
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,914
variational free energy is about

1565
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:50,094
observations. And in what you had added

1566
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:52,274
just recently, you talked about the

1567
01:10:52,312 --> 01:10:54,130
measurement of a joint probability.

1568
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:57,158
There has to be like an aboutness of

1569
01:10:57,244 --> 01:11:00,360
sensory observations for that thing.

1570
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:04,214
Otherwise it has not even a

1571
01:11:04,252 --> 01:11:06,526
sensory. It's not even an inanimate

1572
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:09,180
thing, unless it has this.

1573
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,210
That doesn't mean it's an interesting

1574
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,434
thing. And I think that's what the

1575
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:17,514
recent work helps clarify with

1576
01:11:17,552 --> 01:11:20,814
this sort of taxonomy, from inert to

1577
01:11:20,852 --> 01:11:24,378
more classically active control systems,

1578
01:11:24,554 --> 01:11:28,350
on through just the infinite

1579
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,414
possibilities of broadly cognitive

1580
01:11:31,482 --> 01:11:33,246
modeling ecosystems of shared

1581
01:11:33,278 --> 01:11:37,106
intelligence. Yeah, I think that's a

1582
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:40,114
really interesting, really interesting

1583
01:11:40,232 --> 01:11:42,900
distinction you just made. So the paper

1584
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:46,040
by Lance and co.

1585
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:52,166
Maybe that is the key, because maybe

1586
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,674
this is a hot take, but I generally lean

1587
01:11:54,722 --> 01:11:57,382
towards panpsychism. I do believe that

1588
01:11:57,516 --> 01:11:59,306
if consciousness is the substrate, then

1589
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:01,462
everything is some degree of conscious,

1590
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,414
and we can stop using the word conscious

1591
01:12:03,462 --> 01:12:05,722
and we can use the word model. Right.

1592
01:12:05,776 --> 01:12:08,906
There's the degree to which there's a

1593
01:12:08,928 --> 01:12:12,938
response between the internal

1594
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:14,638
states of the microblanket and the

1595
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,542
external states. So there is some

1596
01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:18,126
exchange of information there, and

1597
01:12:18,148 --> 01:12:19,498
whatever is done with the exchange,

1598
01:12:19,594 --> 01:12:23,694
maybe nothing. And this may be the

1599
01:12:23,732 --> 01:12:26,782
aboutness. Your internal model has

1600
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:30,298
no aboutness. It's just there is

1601
01:12:30,324 --> 01:12:32,546
information that was inputted, and the

1602
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,226
only thing that it outputs is a

1603
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:36,546
constants of its boundary, and that's

1604
01:12:36,578 --> 01:12:38,854
it. And therefore, in order to have

1605
01:12:38,892 --> 01:12:41,814
aboutness, you have to have the

1606
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:45,814
possibility for your internal states to

1607
01:12:45,852 --> 01:12:48,790
shift, to move your boundary somehow

1608
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,194
towards something more specific, to

1609
01:12:51,232 --> 01:12:54,714
segregate, to discretize the

1610
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:56,474
external world into things that have

1611
01:12:56,512 --> 01:12:59,420
more or less valence relative to your.

1612
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,394
Very, very akin to what Donald Hoffman

1613
01:13:02,442 --> 01:13:03,760
is suggesting. Basically.

1614
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,462
Building on that, and throughout your

1615
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:14,714
presentation I got a sense

1616
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:16,474
of the kind of two cultures, the

1617
01:13:16,512 --> 01:13:19,738
sciences and the humanities, not that

1618
01:13:19,744 --> 01:13:21,306
they were exactly being represented in

1619
01:13:21,328 --> 01:13:24,614
the talk, but in terms of excellent

1620
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:28,590
style and classical approach and

1621
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:32,494
the non overlapping magisteria idea

1622
01:13:32,612 --> 01:13:36,430
that they're sort of a separable

1623
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:41,700
technical from the social.

1624
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:47,394
And even though it's widely clear that

1625
01:13:47,512 --> 01:13:50,354
the beliefs in the moment shape the

1626
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,422
niche that has these feedback things,

1627
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:55,302
the development of top down

1628
01:13:55,436 --> 01:13:58,374
architectures in some way that become

1629
01:13:58,492 --> 01:14:01,814
top down affordances for those or other

1630
01:14:01,852 --> 01:14:04,200
people at some future time.

1631
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:11,482
So where do we go from

1632
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:14,650
there? And just like thinking about that

1633
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,340
space,

1634
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,046
how do you approach chapter six of the

1635
01:14:20,068 --> 01:14:23,454
textbook in terms of the recipe for the

1636
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:28,726
active inference generative model for

1637
01:14:28,748 --> 01:14:31,690
a social setting? For a social setting.

1638
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:33,660
Okay,

1639
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:43,074
I think we

1640
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:47,094
go from semantics and we

1641
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:50,790
map the semantics of a group

1642
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,534
and you qualify what that

1643
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:56,674
group is. Maybe the description length

1644
01:14:56,722 --> 01:14:59,046
of that group is extreme. Maybe the

1645
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:01,674
description length is my neighbor, your

1646
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:04,246
neighbor, me and three of their cats,

1647
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:05,546
but not the fourth. You know what I

1648
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:08,346
mean? Like maybe there's a cluster there

1649
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:10,620
and we map the semantics of that group

1650
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:14,062
and it's very specific. And then through

1651
01:15:14,116 --> 01:15:16,990
those semantics, there's an inherent

1652
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,078
causal structures of the structure of

1653
01:15:20,084 --> 01:15:22,174
the beliefs through which we could

1654
01:15:22,212 --> 01:15:24,950
together, like our own little experts,

1655
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,554
try to map. Well, okay, what are our

1656
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:29,506
states? What are observations? How do we

1657
01:15:29,528 --> 01:15:32,306
map to this? And we try to test that

1658
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:35,940
model, and then let's assume that

1659
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:39,350
we disagree. So we're going to have

1660
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,570
different kind of breakdowns of reality,

1661
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,694
and we're going to test the different

1662
01:15:42,732 --> 01:15:45,490
models in a sort of Bayesian expansion

1663
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,280
or Bayesian model reduction, or just

1664
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:51,158
testing different models and DCM style

1665
01:15:51,174 --> 01:15:53,482
and seeing which one maps better to the

1666
01:15:53,536 --> 01:15:55,802
expected observations we're going to see

1667
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:59,386
given our model. And you can do this for

1668
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:01,242
anything. You can do this for a small

1669
01:16:01,296 --> 01:16:03,086
group of neighbors, you can do this for

1670
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:06,126
a very large group of people. You can do

1671
01:16:06,148 --> 01:16:08,654
this for participant research, you can

1672
01:16:08,692 --> 01:16:11,978
do this for medicine. I think it's

1673
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:15,918
really about how do people carve nature

1674
01:16:16,014 --> 01:16:19,826
at its joints and can they point to the

1675
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:22,020
exact observations which they believe

1676
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:25,486
are part of the carvings or not? I think

1677
01:16:25,528 --> 01:16:27,218
that's possible. In social sciences,

1678
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:30,934
it's just about taking the

1679
01:16:30,972 --> 01:16:34,550
time to formalize how observations

1680
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:40,810
map to the carving together. I think

1681
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,254
social sciences generally tend to push

1682
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:47,690
back against a carving.

1683
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,878
They will prefer something that

1684
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:53,870
resembles more a manifold.

1685
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,594
It ebbs and flows, and it's like there's

1686
01:16:57,642 --> 01:17:00,010
some prototypical stuff, but mostly

1687
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,886
there's stuff that could come in and out

1688
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,458
and stuff, and that's fine. You can be

1689
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:08,066
accounted for. So if

1690
01:17:08,088 --> 01:17:11,010
you look at different carvings,

1691
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,986
we can work them through on a sort of

1692
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:16,194
probability and say, well, this is much

1693
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,226
less likely. It's possible it fits

1694
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:20,054
within the carving, but it's much less

1695
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:21,734
likely. What about this? Well, this is

1696
01:17:21,772 --> 01:17:25,686
really like, let's put a probability on

1697
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,650
this, and maybe to you, the probability

1698
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,462
is that's frank.

1699
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:34,394
It's in there. I think they'd be more

1700
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:35,914
comfortable with something that's less

1701
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:39,174
binary and something that's more curved

1702
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:41,574
and allows for new things to be added

1703
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:43,978
were we to disagree on inclusions, et

1704
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:48,030
cetera. That's a great point

1705
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,558
on kind of a narrow note, but to what

1706
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:52,366
you just said there, let's just say that

1707
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:55,842
there's four options. If our prior is 10

1708
01:17:55,896 --> 01:17:59,186
zero, then any number

1709
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:02,066
of evidence times zero stays zero. So

1710
01:18:02,088 --> 01:18:03,698
that's, like, essentially fixed. And

1711
01:18:03,704 --> 01:18:05,970
that's when the hyperparameter is fixed.

1712
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,722
And then if you enable even a tiny

1713
01:18:08,786 --> 01:18:12,966
amount of non zero value,

1714
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:15,538
and so it's like 0.99 and then a bunch

1715
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:18,906
of zeros, then that can still rise off

1716
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:20,666
the baseline. And then that's the whole

1717
01:18:20,688 --> 01:18:22,442
question of attention and cognition, is

1718
01:18:22,496 --> 01:18:25,814
how do you stay aware of relevant,

1719
01:18:25,862 --> 01:18:27,622
salient information, relevance,

1720
01:18:27,686 --> 01:18:29,740
realization, and all that.

1721
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:35,280
Another point was about the

1722
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,814
causal model from the outside, the part

1723
01:18:38,852 --> 01:18:40,266
that the person doesn't directly

1724
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,366
control. There's no direct control in

1725
01:18:42,388 --> 01:18:44,910
the active, generative models of action

1726
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,786
observations. It has to go through the

1727
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:51,250
niche. That's how the thing is defined.

1728
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,238
And so only indirectly can observations

1729
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:56,418
be changed. And so that's the kind of

1730
01:18:56,424 --> 01:18:58,006
part that you don't have agency over,

1731
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,422
literally. Although the other glass half

1732
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:02,966
full side is that is to the extent that

1733
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,278
you do have agency over that, and then

1734
01:19:06,364 --> 01:19:09,690
where that glass is and what narrative

1735
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:13,066
actually puts water into the glass or

1736
01:19:13,088 --> 01:19:16,854
not? And then what is the glass

1737
01:19:16,902 --> 01:19:20,486
half full, glass half empty part? It

1738
01:19:20,528 --> 01:19:23,694
brings so much and just so much, like,

1739
01:19:23,732 --> 01:19:27,040
on the personal thought side.

1740
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,838
But also, it's just really interesting

1741
01:19:29,924 --> 01:19:31,854
to see how this line of research, which

1742
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,700
was more qualitative several years ago,

1743
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:39,678
like in the 2016 to 18

1744
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:42,610
time, and just to see how different

1745
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,762
motifs have come into

1746
01:19:45,816 --> 01:19:49,654
play with the generative models so

1747
01:19:49,692 --> 01:19:53,142
it's a pretty cool lecture, and many

1748
01:19:53,196 --> 01:19:55,798
people appreciated your work in the

1749
01:19:55,804 --> 01:19:57,046
chat, so that's cool. Do you have any

1750
01:19:57,068 --> 01:19:58,646
other comments or anything you want to

1751
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:02,838
talk about? No, but I'm

1752
01:20:02,854 --> 01:20:03,994
going to have to go in about two

1753
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,294
minutes. But I would like to encourage

1754
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:08,074
people to really participate in the next

1755
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:11,646
one, to read some texts and to

1756
01:20:11,668 --> 01:20:14,080
express their ideas, because this is how

1757
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,450
we percolate.

1758
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:19,194
Percolate. This is how we percolate.

1759
01:20:19,242 --> 01:20:22,590
Good ideas and future research. And the

1760
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,774
field of social sciences is ripe for

1761
01:20:25,812 --> 01:20:27,534
this. There's so much that can be done

1762
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:30,062
right now, translated, connected, like,

1763
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:32,782
we can get towards a confluent time in

1764
01:20:32,836 --> 01:20:35,746
research and science.

1765
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:39,542
It. All right. Really looking forward to

1766
01:20:39,676 --> 01:20:42,054
the discussion and hoping that people

1767
01:20:42,252 --> 01:20:45,990
engage in this affordance.

1768
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,214
All right, thank you. See you.
