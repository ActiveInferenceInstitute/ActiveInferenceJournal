1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,598
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:12,590
It's september 20 2023.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,538
We're at the Active Inference Institute

4
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,766
in the course Active Inference for the

5
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,626
Social Sciences, and here with Mahault

6
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,702
Aberrassen, who will be presenting today

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,862
on norm scripts and linguistics under

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,654
Active Inference. So thank you,

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:30,126
Mahault, to you. Awesome. So hi

10
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:33,302
everyone, in as last

11
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:37,030
time there was a presentation on

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,734
semiotics and semantics. I won't dig too

13
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,326
far into linguistics, but I'll touch on

14
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:45,500
it at the end of the course. So,

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,950
what are we going to do? In this module,

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,642
we're going to explore the concept of

17
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:53,386
active inference and its relevance to

18
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,798
social norms and human decision making.

19
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:59,642
As you will have seen in the previous

20
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,726
classes, active inference is a

21
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:03,486
theoretical framework that seeks to

22
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,026
explain how organisms, including humans,

23
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:07,486
engage with their environment to

24
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,154
minimize uncertainty and maintain their

25
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,634
internal states. We're not going to dig

26
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,714
into these concepts too too much,

27
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,380
because I assume they have been

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,654
previously explained at length.

29
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:21,014
However, I will explain how they connect

30
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,874
to social phenomena. So this framework

31
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:25,814
has significant implications for

32
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,326
understanding social behavior, as it can

33
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:30,534
help explain how individuals conform to

34
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:33,594
social norms and make decisions based on

35
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:36,694
the expectations of others. We'll delve

36
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:38,586
into the role of active inference in

37
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:41,974
human societies, emphasizing how humans

38
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,346
and other organisms constantly seek to

39
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,834
minimize their uncertainty about the

40
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,934
world by updating their beliefs and

41
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:49,802
taking actions to maintain a stable

42
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:53,322
internal state. This is a crucial

43
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:55,386
process for survival. It allows

44
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,118
individuals to predict and adapt to

45
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:58,866
their environment. In the context of

46
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,806
human societies, active inference plays

47
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,426
a critical role in explaining how

48
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,970
individuals navigate complex social

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,970
situations, conform to social

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,306
expectations, and make decisions that

51
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:12,850
align with their beliefs and values.

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,398
Furthermore, we'll explore the concept

53
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,226
of deontic value within active

54
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,390
inference, which refers to the value

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,406
attributed to actions based on their

56
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,866
adherence to social norms and

57
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:28,278
expectations. By adhering

58
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,826
to social norms, individuals can

59
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,906
minimize the uncertainty associated with

60
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,954
their actions and maintain a sense of

61
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:36,974
predictability and stability in their

62
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:40,094
social environment. So together, all

63
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,934
these insights will provide you with a

64
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,726
comprehensive understanding of the

65
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,546
complex interplay between active

66
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:47,054
inference, social norms, and human

67
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:50,274
decision making. So let's dive in.

68
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,906
We'll start by introducing a

69
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,098
philosophical framework. Building on the

70
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,794
framework of active inference in

71
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:58,734
activism offers us a complementary lens

72
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,986
to understand the dynamic and contextual

73
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,254
nature of social cognition. So while

74
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,406
active inference provides the

75
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:05,926
computational underpinnings for

76
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,650
understanding social norms and decision

77
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,146
making, we still need to anchor

78
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:12,514
ourselves within a larger theoretical

79
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,562
framework. Inactivism enriches this

80
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,054
perspective by emphasizing the practical

81
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:19,978
and developmental aspects of social

82
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:23,466
understanding. So what is

83
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:26,394
inactivism if it hasn't been introduced

84
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:29,322
before? Inactivism is a philosophical

85
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,962
stance that extends beyond traditional

86
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,606
theories of cognition, emphasizing the

87
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,450
role of interactions and relational

88
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,306
dynamics in shaping both individual and

89
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:44,450
social cognition. It argues

90
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,818
that cognition is a dynamic, real time,

91
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:52,098
fluid and contextual social action.

92
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,658
You can read more about this in ineshi

93
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:57,880
Bolito's texts and Thomas Van S in 2022.

94
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,906
Generative models and hermeneutics serve

95
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:04,470
as a cognitive structure and framework

96
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,050
for interpretation, respectively.

97
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,582
These elements are continuously updated

98
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,234
based on social interactions and

99
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:15,794
signals, thereby facilitating effective

100
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:18,110
communication and understanding.

101
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,914
Hermeneutics provides a theoretical

102
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,550
framework for interpreting social

103
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,114
signals and cues crucial for effective

104
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:31,630
social interactions. So hermeneutics

105
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,850
allows for a nuanced understanding of

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,530
contextually constituted meaning.

107
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,634
It goes beyond the conventional notion

108
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,294
of self contained objects to explore the

109
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:47,346
deeper contextual meanings in behavior

110
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,890
and cognition. Yatimer's hermeneutics

111
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,974
offers a way to analyze social action

112
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:57,046
that goes beyond positivist and humanist

113
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,894
approaches by fusing the conceptual

114
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,170
schemes of the observer and the social

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,126
actor. It complements inactivism by

116
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,106
providing the interpretive framework

117
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:10,174
that are continuously updated through

118
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:12,574
social interactions, enriching our

119
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,826
understanding of cognition as dynamic,

120
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:17,630
real time and contextual.

121
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,170
In the realm of social cognition,

122
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,534
inactivism introduces the concept

123
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:27,810
of generalized synchronization,

124
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,866
which allows for a nuanced understanding

125
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,058
of how social interactions mutually

126
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,990
influence cognitive processes.

127
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,854
The relationship between individual

128
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,042
beliefs and social expectations is

129
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:45,398
complex, and it's fundamentally shaped

130
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,514
by our interactions with the others and

131
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:50,794
the world. We thus see that

132
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,722
meaning is coconstituted by the

133
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,906
individual and the environment. If we

134
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,906
adopt an activist and hermeneutics

135
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:01,194
approach, we find the philosophical

136
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,814
foundations that lead into a

137
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,654
comprehensive overview of the

138
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,966
intersection with social cognition. If

139
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:10,186
you want more references to read about

140
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,098
these topics, you can ask me at the end

141
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,180
of the class and I can send you a few.

142
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,666
So it's essential to note, however,

143
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,914
that there are some criticisms that

144
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:22,674
point out the limitations of inactivism

145
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:26,198
in explaining social cognition. One of

146
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,070
the key criticism is that current

147
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,294
articulations of inactivism are not yet

148
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,406
up to the task when it comes to

149
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:35,370
explaining complex social interactions.

150
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,422
Despite these criticisms, inactivism

151
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,066
provides a consistent epistemology for a

152
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:46,160
psychology that is intrinsically social.

153
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,426
Looking forward, the field of inactivism

154
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,494
and social cognition is ripe for

155
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,478
exploration and would benefit from a

156
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,090
deeper connection to active inference.

157
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,434
There has been such research, so

158
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:01,838
researchers like Maxwell Ramstead

159
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:04,494
has developed a concept of inactive

160
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,606
inference, which offers a promising

161
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:08,738
avenue for integrating inactivism and

162
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:12,578
active inference. His research aligns

163
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,726
with folk psychology and suggests that

164
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,850
these frameworks can coexist and enrich

165
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,350
our understandings of social cognition.

166
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,066
Future other directions could involve,

167
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,006
for instance, integrating inactivism

168
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,754
with other cognitive theories and

169
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,154
exploring its applicability in real

170
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,394
world social scenarios. Through its

171
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,074
connection to active inference, we can

172
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:34,890
make accurate and testable predictions.

173
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,846
So while inactivism now provides us with

174
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,334
a foundational understanding of

175
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:43,246
cognition and social interaction, the

176
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:46,126
concept of agency further enriches this

177
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,770
understanding by introducing more

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,862
philosophical perspectives that align

179
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:54,514
with or diverge from inactivism. So we

180
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,466
can build on top of inactivism through

181
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,050
the notion of agency.

182
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,390
So we will now focus on the key issue of

183
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,250
inactivism, which is how does agency

184
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,830
emerge? How do things self organize

185
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,326
through their interaction with the

186
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:13,714
environment? Why are they not fully

187
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,074
determined? How can we account for

188
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,894
agency in a system where effectively

189
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,198
self organization is seen as some degree

190
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,906
of determined by the materiality of the

191
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,410
agent and its environment,

192
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,166
agency is a complex construct that has

193
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:31,742
been explored through a multitude of

194
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,390
philosophical and scientific frameworks.

195
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,654
One prominent approach is the inactive

196
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,314
affordance based perspective, which

197
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,898
underscores the centrality of the I can

198
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:46,942
notion in shaping both cognitive

199
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:50,194
processes and behavioral outcomes. So

200
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:52,066
Maxwell Ramstein again substantiates

201
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,278
this perspective and resonates with the

202
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,750
research conducted by Bruenberg in 2018.

203
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,014
It posits, for instance, that agency is

204
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,994
far from being a mere passive state.

205
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,582
Rather, it involves active dynamic

206
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,330
engagement with the environment.

207
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,262
Current investigations in this domain

208
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,474
are being, for instance, continued by

209
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,534
researchers like Riddipitlia, who is

210
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:21,182
working on connecting properly the

211
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,318
psychological phenomenon of agency in

212
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:28,042
active inference modeling. In parallel,

213
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,014
Tom Holtzian Bayesian models

214
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:31,666
conceptualize active inference as a

215
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,854
Bayesian process aimed at minimizing

216
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:37,166
prediction error. This model finds

217
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:39,314
support in the work of Kalan Kopp and

218
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,054
suggests that agency is an active

219
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,950
endeavor who aligns sensory inputs with

220
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,938
internal predictions, thereby fostering

221
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,630
a sense of control and self efficacy.

222
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,666
The cybernetic interpretations offers a

223
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,034
more mechanistic lens, focusing on

224
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:00,346
control mechanism in homeostasis. In

225
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,018
this view, agency is not just about

226
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:06,062
accurate predictions, but also about

227
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,654
maintaining a balanced state through

228
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,666
dynamic interpretations interactions

229
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:13,434
sorry with the environment. Recent

230
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,966
studies highlight the significance of

231
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,846
performance based inferences in shaping

232
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,370
our sense of agency.

233
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,146
That approach suggests that the

234
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,954
congruence between our actions and their

235
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,126
expected outcomes plays a pivotal role

236
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:31,670
in strengthening or weakening our sense

237
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,902
of agency. So collectively, these

238
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:37,430
diverse interpretations serve as

239
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,846
intellectual bridges connecting the

240
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:42,166
domains of philosophy, psychology and

241
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,530
computational neuroscience. They offer

242
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,962
complementary insights that enrich our

243
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:50,070
understanding of agency, thereby

244
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,346
contributing to the broader discourse on

245
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,634
inactivism and its application in

246
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,374
understanding complex cognitive and

247
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:58,750
social phenomena.

248
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,410
So how is agency extended?

249
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,834
Deep temporal models and the concept of

250
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:11,830
agency both focus on the minimization of

251
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,214
uncertainty and the optimization of

252
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:17,762
decision making. Deep temporal models

253
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:20,054
provide a computational framework that

254
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:23,622
can model the complex, time dependent

255
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,250
patterns of behavior and cognition,

256
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,674
offering insights into how agency is

257
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:32,810
exercised in dynamic social contexts.

258
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,694
In the context of our overall goal of

259
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,546
understanding scripts through active

260
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,834
inference, combining deep temporal

261
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,526
models with theories of agency allows us

262
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,266
to create more nuanced and predictive

263
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:47,142
models of how individuals navigate

264
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,034
social norms and make decisions through

265
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,690
goal directed actions across different

266
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,798
scales of concern. In social cognition,

267
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:59,374
deep temporal models help individuals

268
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,254
anticipate and adapt to changes in their

269
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,650
social environment across timescales

270
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,554
that go beyond what would be considered

271
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,194
simply reactive, thereby reducing

272
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,746
uncertainty and enhancing decision

273
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,514
making. An individual can

274
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:16,138
plan and extend agency beyond the

275
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:19,466
current moment. So, in the realm of

276
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,126
planning algorithms, deep temporal

277
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,574
models allow us for a theoretical

278
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:26,398
foundation for optimality, especially

279
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:29,754
when resources are limited, they enable

280
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:32,126
state abstraction and cognitive control,

281
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,314
essential elements in hierarchical

282
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,860
planning. Deep temporal models also

283
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,982
contributes to various cognitive

284
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,966
processes, such as action understanding

285
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,506
and language processing, which we will

286
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,606
discuss later. They can be interpreted

287
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,086
and integrated into deep reinforcement

288
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,634
learning algorithms to develop socially

289
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:55,458
aware navigation policies. Deep temporal

290
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,430
models thus serve as a computational,

291
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,586
again bridge between the neural

292
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:02,018
mechanisms of action understanding and

293
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:03,718
the cognitive processes that give rise

294
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,730
to agency.

295
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,300
So what might be potentially a

296
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,834
neural mechanism that allows us to

297
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:17,678
connect deep temporal models to social

298
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,734
interactions? This is where we bring in

299
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,778
the insights from mirror neuron systems

300
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:25,246
and active inference. This way we can

301
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,986
have a more comprehensive models that

302
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:28,802
not only predicts but explains how

303
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,974
individuals exercise agency in complex

304
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,290
social landscapes.

305
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,926
Here, mirror neurons serve as a neural

306
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,010
cornerstone for social cognition,

307
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,606
firing not only during the execution of

308
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,494
an action, but also during the

309
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,362
observation of that same action

310
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:48,546
performed by another. These specialized

311
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,226
neurons are central to the continuous

312
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,098
updating of internal models of the

313
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,722
environment, including the actions and

314
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:59,110
intentions of others. They minimize

315
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,310
uncertainty and facilitate navigation

316
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,754
through complex social landscapes,

317
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,326
allowing us for smoother social

318
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,274
interactions and more effective

319
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:13,086
communication. So here the

320
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:15,034
deep temporal models are hierarchical

321
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:16,398
generative models that offer a

322
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:20,478
computational framework and these models

323
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,430
are adept at handling the complexities

324
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,490
of self agency and other agency.

325
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,006
In the context of self agency, a deep

326
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:32,230
temporal models affords a high bias or

327
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,962
precision to proprioceptive predictions,

328
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:36,818
which gives us a nuanced understanding

329
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:41,030
of one's own actions when

330
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,034
observing another. This bias is

331
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,626
adaptively suppressed, enabling the

332
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:47,734
system to be flexible and context

333
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:51,574
sensitive. The interplay

334
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,578
between mirror neurons and deep temporal

335
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,894
model is thus a compelling area of

336
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:59,726
research. Mirror neurons contribute to

337
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,042
the process of updating internal models,

338
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:05,626
which is a core function of deep

339
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,814
temporal models. This synergistic

340
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:11,406
relationship allows for a more nuanced

341
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:13,810
understanding of action prediction.

342
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,194
We can see a deep and significant

343
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,946
implication for long term planning in

344
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,326
social context. The continuous updating

345
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,078
of internal models facilitated by mirror

346
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,930
neurons and computationally powered here

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,946
through the deep temporal models is

348
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,706
crucial for making complex decisions and

349
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,110
planning future social interactions.

350
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,534
There's been recent research that

351
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,974
indicates that our capacity to

352
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:43,806
understand actions extend beyond the

353
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,234
mirror neuron systems, which involves

354
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:48,286
the activation of areas signaling

355
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:51,522
unexpected events. This adds another

356
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,202
layer of complexity to the already

357
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,758
intricate interplay between the neurons

358
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,114
and the models, which suggest that our

359
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,526
understanding of action prediction and

360
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:02,854
social cognition is far from complete

361
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:05,494
but is advancing rapidly thanks to these

362
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,358
integrated frameworks. So, given the

363
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,598
ongoing research on mirror neurons,

364
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:13,622
we have to consider how computational

365
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,226
models like deep temporal models can

366
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,034
offer a more nuanced framework for

367
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:18,890
studying these neural mechanisms.

368
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,294
So let's try to think about some

369
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,514
of the issues with mirror neuron

370
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:31,930
research. It's not without controversy.

371
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,458
Some critical reviews argue that there's

372
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,206
no compelling evidence supporting the

373
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,594
role of mirror neurons in action

374
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:40,386
understanding. Others can suggest that

375
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,922
mirror neurons may be involved in lower

376
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,790
level processes of action perception,

377
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,582
but not in higher level intention

378
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:48,190
understanding. So we need more studies

379
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,566
to control for premotor contributions to

380
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,626
action perception and provide a clearer

381
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,434
definition of what is meant by action

382
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:57,106
understanding. This is particularly

383
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:58,626
important as some research indicates

384
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,474
that there may be no proof that mirror

385
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,690
neurons lead to action understanding.

386
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,826
This doesn't mean that it negates the

387
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,458
importance of these systems. It means we

388
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,954
need more research to make sure that

389
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,854
they are in fact related to action

390
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:16,074
understanding. The functional properties

391
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,754
of the mirror neuron system indicates

392
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,594
that action understanding may primarily

393
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:22,366
be based on the motor cognition that

394
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,880
underpins one's own capacity to act.

395
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,306
So we will now consider how these neural

396
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,330
mechanisms can be integrated into

397
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,266
broader frameworks like extended and

398
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,114
optimized active inference. So by doing

399
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:35,746
so, we can leverage generative models to

400
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,426
provide a more nuanced understanding of

401
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,782
action perception, prediction, social

402
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,974
cognition and adapting behaviors to lead

403
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,846
us to scripts, gender perspectives and

404
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,350
cultural affordances.

405
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,914
We have expanded in time. Now let's

406
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,380
expand in space.

407
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,894
Extended and optimized active inference

408
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,494
represents a comprehensive framework

409
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,134
that bridges between internal cognitive

410
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,694
processes and external environmental

411
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:06,574
interactions. Generative models serve as

412
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:09,486
the cornerstone extending beyond the

413
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:11,966
confines of an organism's brain and body

414
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:14,522
to incorporate external cognitive

415
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:17,006
resources such as maps or written

416
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:19,634
language. This extension not only

417
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,858
enhances the efficiency and accuracy of

418
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,694
these models, but also has practical

419
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,586
implications in various domains like

420
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:26,894
social interactions and language

421
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:30,166
processing. If we think of

422
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:31,830
a cognitive niche,

423
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,634
the framework introduces key dynamics

424
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,054
like selective developmental and

425
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:41,014
organism niche coordination. The

426
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,766
dynamics elucidate the intricate

427
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,994
relationship between organisms and their

428
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:48,966
environment, including the reciprocal

429
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:51,366
effects of environmental modifications

430
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,826
and selection pressures in sequential

431
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:57,194
dynamics, generative models facilitate

432
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,494
effective communication and

433
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:01,646
understanding. They allow us to see the

434
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,214
emergence of behavioral and

435
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,150
neurophysiological correlates such as

436
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,786
theta gamma coupling, which we will

437
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:09,026
discuss later in neural activity, which

438
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,994
can be seen as an emergent property of

439
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:12,686
belief. Updating under variational

440
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,890
message passing.

441
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,646
Building upon the foundational aspects

442
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,046
of extending an optimized active

443
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:22,338
inference, it's crucial to delve into

444
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:24,530
its specific applications in social

445
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,194
context. When we optimize our generative

446
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,906
models through social scripts and norms,

447
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:31,138
we can see how extending active

448
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,194
inference serves as a practical tool for

449
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:35,962
navigating and modifying complex social

450
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,854
landscapes aligning with the framework's

451
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,966
broader goals of cognitive niche

452
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:45,054
construction. So we can see that this

453
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:47,034
integrates both internal and external

454
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:49,166
cognitive resources to optimize the

455
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,240
generative model.

456
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,026
Scripts serve as a cognitive blueprint

457
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,354
that reduce the uncertainty and

458
00:19:58,392 --> 00:20:00,050
facilitate successful social

459
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,910
interactions. They are continuously

460
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,730
updated through adapted changing social

461
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,254
landscapes. They enhance the fluidity

462
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,630
and adaptability of social behaviors.

463
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,574
Social norms act as a macro level

464
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,326
behavioral expectation that shapes the

465
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:21,614
social environment and creates favorable

466
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,922
niches for human interactions. These

467
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,674
norms are internal representations that

468
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:31,050
help individuals navigate complex social

469
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,890
environments effectively.

470
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,750
So here, cognitive niche construction

471
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,646
involves active modification of the

472
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,914
environment to create those favorable

473
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:47,454
contexts. Extended active inference

474
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,454
takes this a step further by allowing

475
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,422
for the optimization of generative

476
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,346
models, creating environments that are

477
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:56,130
not just favorable but also harmonious.

478
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,894
The comprehensive approach here has

479
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,890
implications that span from psychology,

480
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,694
sociology, artificial intelligence and

481
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,306
allows us to potentially set the stage

482
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:07,922
for future research in cognitive

483
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,586
science. So here we

484
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:12,954
see that there's an importance to

485
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:16,566
optimizing internal models for effective

486
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:19,638
social interactions. So while extended

487
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,286
active inference focuses on the broader

488
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:22,934
cognitive architecture involving

489
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,070
generative models and social norms,

490
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,994
here we zero in on the role of deontic

491
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,766
value and social conformity providing a

492
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,366
more nuanced understanding of how

493
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,302
individuals adapt and shape their social

494
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:37,966
environment. So the concept

495
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:41,122
of deontic value refers to the value

496
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,074
attributed to actions based on their

497
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:44,466
adherence to social norms and

498
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:48,622
expectations. It allows us to guide

499
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,926
individual choices. When faced with a

500
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:54,086
decision, an individual weigh the

501
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:56,386
deontay value of potential actions

502
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,790
against other factors like personal

503
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,346
preferences, beliefs to determine the

504
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,250
most appropriate course of action.

505
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,380
He'll just allow me one.

506
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,976
So this ties us very nicely to the

507
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,730
notion of agency that we explored before

508
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,044
in Regimes of Expectations by Axel

509
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:22,408
Constance. We elaborate that deontay

510
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,548
cues enable the environment to learn

511
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,912
about the behavior of its inhabitants,

512
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:29,868
effectively outsourcing the epistemic

513
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:32,200
and pragmatic values of any behavior.

514
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,746
You can see that the expansion of active

515
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,494
inference here takes on a whole other

516
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,818
meaning. So active

517
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,126
inference allows for dynamic adaptation,

518
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:47,066
enables the individual to update their

519
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:50,074
internal models, better anticipate and

520
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:51,994
connect to their environment such that

521
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,090
the environment and the individual

522
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,002
mutually model each other. The ontic

523
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,234
value here serves as a common thread

524
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:01,886
between active inference and regimes of

525
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:02,750
expectations.

526
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,136
Through these regimes of expectation in

527
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:10,364
active inference we'll achieve a better

528
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,364
understanding of social conformity and

529
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:13,390
decision making.

530
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,026
Regimes of expectation centers on the

531
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:21,042
computational construct of deontic value

532
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,286
which we explained before and

533
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:25,846
aligns with the broader research on

534
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:28,546
social conformity, especially the winner

535
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:30,934
takes all model proposed by Frank in

536
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:32,280
2008.

537
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,406
Social expectation here play a

538
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,962
significant role in shaping human

539
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,570
decisions and specifically social

540
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,350
conformity act as a learning strategy

541
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,254
which is effective in uncertain

542
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:48,698
environments. So now that we build on

543
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,814
the foundational role of deontic value

544
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,334
and the regimes of expectation, we find

545
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:56,094
that this computational construct also

546
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,446
serve as a crucial weighing factor in

547
00:23:58,468 --> 00:24:02,530
individual decision making. So we'll see

548
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,186
how we can put this effect directly on

549
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,180
decision making.

550
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,912
Sorry regimes of expectations have

551
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,004
basically a function of fitness

552
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:21,348
enhancing social conformity. It suggests

553
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:23,160
that conforming to social norms has

554
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,112
evolutionary advantages. It leads into

555
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,256
a circular causality between shared

556
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:31,564
Bayesian expectations and individual

557
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:35,212
policy selection. It's consistent with

558
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,124
findings by Sanfi in 2014 which

559
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:40,284
emphasize the importance of norms and

560
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,450
expectations in social decision making.

561
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,246
So now that we have how the environment

562
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,554
and the individual co construct through

563
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,410
these regimes of expectations,

564
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,046
we will find how this allows us to

565
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:59,354
construct a sense of self, specifically

566
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:00,560
the social self.

567
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,466
Here, social norms and shared Bayesian

568
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:07,746
expectations link our individual and

569
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:09,506
collective decision making processes to

570
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,890
the broader understanding of selfhood.

571
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,566
So how does active inference allow us to

572
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,840
model how we derive the sense of self?

573
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,202
Let's start by explaining the three main

574
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,730
types of selves minimal,

575
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,940
narrative and social.

576
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,370
The minimal self is the prereflexive

577
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,946
experience of being a subject,

578
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,634
emphasizing the body's role in shaping

579
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:41,840
subjective experience.

580
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,670
The narrative self is shaped by personal

581
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,486
stories and experiences, highlighting

582
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:51,186
the importance of generative models in

583
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:55,502
organizing. These experiences aligns

584
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,954
with the active inference, formalism and

585
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:00,306
psychological desires, providing a

586
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:03,250
coherent narrative that guides our sense

587
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,140
of self across time.

588
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,814
The social self emerges from

589
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:11,894
interactions with others and is

590
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:15,370
influenced by social norms, values and

591
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,450
shared generative models.

592
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,086
This concept is supported by the folk

593
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:24,314
concept of intentionality, which

594
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,402
includes desires, beliefs, intentions,

595
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,150
awareness and skill.

596
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,494
Understanding these facets of the sense

597
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:34,058
of self through the lens of active

598
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:36,618
inference gives us an integrative

599
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:39,498
cognitive process for emotions and

600
00:26:39,524 --> 00:26:43,166
social interactions. So now we'll delve

601
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:44,690
more into the intricacies of the social

602
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,282
self to show that the generative model

603
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:49,634
and social scripts discussed earlier are

604
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:52,706
integral to its formation. These scripts

605
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,258
optimized through extended active

606
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:55,782
inference not only guide our social

607
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,446
interaction, but also contribute to the

608
00:26:57,468 --> 00:27:00,486
shaping of that self, creating a

609
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:02,438
seamless interplay between individual

610
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,234
cognition and collective social

611
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:07,354
behavior. So,

612
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,226
as we said earlier, social scripts are

613
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:11,126
the cognitive blueprints that guide

614
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:13,974
individuals through a myriad of expected

615
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:16,730
actions or events in social contexts.

616
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,954
These scripts are essentially generative

617
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:21,294
models that help individuals predict and

618
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:24,506
navigate social interactions. They're

619
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:26,046
indispensable. They allow us to

620
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,106
continuously update our internal models

621
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:30,594
to minimize uncertainty and achieve a

622
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:34,046
stable internal state. It's particularly

623
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,522
important in a world where social

624
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:37,806
interactions are increasingly complex

625
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:40,690
and laden with unspoken expectations.

626
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,772
Its optimization serves as a micro level

627
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:48,944
mechanism that complements the macro

628
00:27:48,992 --> 00:27:50,836
level influence of social norms and

629
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,472
deontic values, creating a cohesive

630
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:55,220
understanding of social behavior.

631
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,736
Social scripts can be enshrined in

632
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:01,976
deontic cues which enable the

633
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,892
environment to learn about the behavior

634
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:05,732
of its inhabitants, effectively

635
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,184
outsourcing the epistemic and pragmatic

636
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:09,804
values of any behavior. As we saw

637
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,060
earlier in cognitive niche construction,

638
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,952
the concept of contextual modulation

639
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:19,356
integrates sensory and motor cues to

640
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,628
influence our actions and decisions,

641
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:23,824
allowing for dynamic adaptation and

642
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:26,400
refinement of generative models.

643
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,346
Through this modulation, we can see how

644
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:35,566
social scripts and norms are shaped and

645
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,446
adapted over time, which promotes the

646
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,394
adaptability in the face of changing

647
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,766
environments of individuals embedded in

648
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:43,790
that environment.

649
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,992
Now, contextual modulation

650
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:53,316
here is pretty important and the

651
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:55,156
mechanism not only refines our

652
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:56,884
generative model, but also provides the

653
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:59,952
adaptive flexibility required in complex

654
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,408
environments, which unites the

655
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:03,956
theoretical underpinnings of active

656
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:05,576
inference with empirical findings on

657
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:06,760
adaptive behavior.

658
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,452
So, according to Francesco Donoruma,

659
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:14,424
action perception is an active

660
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:16,856
inferential process that combines motor

661
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,448
prediction and hypothesis testing

662
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:20,972
crucial for understanding social

663
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,536
scripts. Adaptive social behavior thus

664
00:29:24,568 --> 00:29:26,656
results from the dynamic interplay of

665
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:29,212
socioeffective and socio cognitive

666
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:33,676
processes. Research by Berg Merza

667
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:36,320
provides proof of concept that social

668
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,264
context may alter perception, enabling

669
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:42,804
more adaptive behavior. It's also

670
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,820
supported by studies that reveal how

671
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,668
instinctive behavior circuits in the

672
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:49,904
hypothalamus dynamically encode spatial

673
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,004
and sensory cues to drive adaptive

674
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:53,320
social behaviors.

675
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,572
Contextual modulation and social scripts

676
00:29:57,636 --> 00:29:59,896
are integral to adaptive behavior and

677
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:02,616
action perception, which allows us to

678
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,128
show how social interactions are crafted

679
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:07,804
through these different scale, these

680
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:10,520
deep temporal models that integrate

681
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,252
various kinds of priors at different

682
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:16,120
scales. So here, contextual modulation

683
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,336
acts as a linchpin in the integration of

684
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,252
social scripts into the generative

685
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:21,120
models.

686
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,084
We can now appreciate how generative

687
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:27,184
model and social scripts coalesce to

688
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:29,508
form a comprehensive framework for

689
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,140
understanding interactions.

690
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,414
So active inference is a nuanced

691
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:42,290
lens to explore how power dynamics

692
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,070
shape shared generative models,

693
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,794
thereby influencing the cultural

694
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:53,030
affordances available to individuals.

695
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,966
For instance, epistemic communities

696
00:30:57,158 --> 00:31:00,166
serves as platforms where power dynamics

697
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:03,238
can significantly shape shared beliefs

698
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:06,522
and actions. Through the construction of

699
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:10,234
certain niche, we can see that existing

700
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:13,342
power structure lead to the creation of

701
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:15,422
environments that perpetuate these

702
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,566
structures through certain kinds of

703
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:19,774
scripts, certain kinds of norms and

704
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,874
through the valence that we associate to

705
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:24,162
our sense of self relative to these

706
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,874
scripts. Cultural affordances here

707
00:31:27,912 --> 00:31:29,762
are dynamically influenced by power

708
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:32,574
tinged asymmetries. These asymmetries

709
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,854
can affect how individuals perceive and

710
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,682
enact social scripts, which further

711
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,606
shapes the cultural affordances that

712
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,790
they encounter.

713
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,646
We see how deeply intertwined cultural

714
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:49,210
affordances are with power dynamics.

715
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,166
It allows us to understand societal

716
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:56,250
structures in more depth.

717
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,346
So when we expand the scope of active

718
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:01,834
inference in cultural affordance

719
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:05,102
negotiation, we can dive into a case

720
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,466
study that of gender norms and gender

721
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:10,590
fluidity to broader cultural contexts.

722
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,274
This exemplifies the influence of power

723
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:18,126
dynamics. So just as individuals

724
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:19,534
navigate and adapt to cultural

725
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:21,346
affordances that are deeply shaped by

726
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:23,446
societal power structures, they have to

727
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:25,638
navigate gender related affordances that

728
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,000
they also engage with.

729
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,730
So through this, we can also understand

730
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,970
the concept of gender fluidity.

731
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,310
Here, generative model play a specific

732
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,874
role which is to adapt to changing

733
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:42,890
societal norms and gender related

734
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,714
affordances. These are cultural

735
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:48,158
affordances dynamic for

736
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:50,346
maniche construction allows individuals

737
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:52,866
to create and adapt environments that

738
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,686
reflect their evolving gender identity

739
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:55,810
and expression.

740
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,514
The concept of affordance negotiation is

741
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:03,470
particularly relevant here. It refers to

742
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,546
the process by which individuals adapt

743
00:33:06,578 --> 00:33:09,250
their behavior to maximize opportunities

744
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,046
and minimize challenges in their

745
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:14,674
environment. In the context of gender

746
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:16,662
fluidity, it involves navigating complex

747
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,886
social scripts and norms that shape

748
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:20,090
gender expression.

749
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,846
Research suggests that these gender

750
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,754
differences in negotiation are

751
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,366
contextually bound and can be subject to

752
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:31,674
change. By understanding how individuals

753
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,850
navigate these social scripts and norms,

754
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,246
we can for instance, address the

755
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:37,770
limitations or constraints that affect

756
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,590
expressions of their gender identity.

757
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,306
So here, gender through the lens of

758
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:46,194
active inference as a case study and

759
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,834
affordance negotiation gives us a

760
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:52,130
comprehensive view of the social

761
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,038
psychology and how it can apply to

762
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:56,486
gender studies, for instance. But this

763
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:58,354
is true for many other kinds of cultural

764
00:33:58,402 --> 00:33:59,350
phenomena.

765
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,686
So we build now on the understanding of

766
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,442
how active inference and power dynamics

767
00:34:05,506 --> 00:34:07,210
shape cultural affordances.

768
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,882
We can see how this allows us to

769
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:15,050
understand potentially puzzling actions

770
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,798
which are shaped by social scripts and

771
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:20,586
the dynamics within the epistemic

772
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:23,134
communities they inhabit. So we have

773
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:25,086
defined how scripts allow us to

774
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:28,186
interpret different kinds of behaviors

775
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:31,822
and how people navigate their desired

776
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:34,450
outcomes. Given these social scripts,

777
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,354
so what happens when we are faced with

778
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:41,634
puzzling actions? People rely on their

779
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:43,054
generative models to update their

780
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,446
beliefs and expectations. So do we

781
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:47,174
interpret these behaviors based on

782
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,910
inherent traits or situational reasons?

783
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,702
Here, traits and motives interact with

784
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,186
in predicting behaviors. Channeling the

785
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,994
behavioral expression through one's life

786
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,074
throughout one's life. On the other

787
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:02,006
hand, contextual cues significantly

788
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:03,306
influence the interpretation of

789
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:05,974
ambiguous behaviors. Social scripts

790
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,546
guide our expectation in social

791
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,574
situations can either be adapted when

792
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,782
confronted with unexpected behavior or

793
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,802
allow us to shift from script to script

794
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,886
to have a better prior over what we

795
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,694
might expect next. So for instance,

796
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:22,926
this challenge is particularly

797
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,834
pronounced for those who diverge from

798
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,830
established social norms and script.

799
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,106
Their interpretations are influenced by

800
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,926
the dynamics of information spread

801
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,850
within their epistemic communities.

802
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,066
Understanding ambiguous social behaviors

803
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:38,274
is not just about individual cognition,

804
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,194
but also about the social and cultural

805
00:35:40,242 --> 00:35:42,230
contexts that shape our interpretations.

806
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,354
So now we're going to dive from this

807
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,510
point into the specific contextual

808
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,514
factors that further nuance our

809
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:54,694
understanding. Our former discussion

810
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,346
emphasized the influence of power and

811
00:35:56,368 --> 00:35:58,446
social norms and now we're going to turn

812
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:00,046
our attention to the impact, say, of

813
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,282
social anxiety, behavioral flexibility

814
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:04,826
and goal oriented perception in shaping

815
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,910
our interpretations of social behavior.

816
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,250
Understanding social behaviors often

817
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,470
requires an approach that goes beyond

818
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,250
trade based interpretations.

819
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,494
Contextual factors like social anxiety

820
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:20,434
can significantly influence how we

821
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,318
interpret an ambiguous social cue. For

822
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:25,874
instance, determining the most likely

823
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,842
prior, using the most likely prior,

824
00:36:27,906 --> 00:36:29,686
rather than being open to other kinds of

825
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:33,314
interpretations. Behavioral flexibility

826
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:35,480
is another crucial aspect to consider.

827
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,806
It allows for adaptability and nuanced

828
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,650
understanding of social behaviors across

829
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,866
different social contexts such that a

830
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:45,482
same script can be interpreted different

831
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,826
ways through different kinds of

832
00:36:46,848 --> 00:36:50,718
behaviors. The concept of goals here

833
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,302
plays an important role in social

834
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:55,822
perception. They can serve to provide

835
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:59,374
a broad implication or for where

836
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,086
we understand an individual, to try to

837
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:03,314
be headed, such that while their lower

838
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,946
level script may be different from the

839
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,686
one we have, their higher level script

840
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:08,130
is still interpretable.

841
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,076
So now we're going to try to see what

842
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,516
can be the outcomes in real life of all

843
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:20,236
these processes. Together we're going to

844
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:22,764
focus on cognitive mechanisms that

845
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:24,476
underpin social phenomena like

846
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:26,780
confirmation bias and echo chambers.

847
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,628
Building on the concept of active

848
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,868
inference, we explore how individuals

849
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,552
not only interpret ambiguous social

850
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,568
cues, but also actively seek information

851
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,108
that confirm their preexisting belief,

852
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:40,900
thereby shaping epistemic communities.

853
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,634
Confirmation bias is a cognitive

854
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,794
tendency that affects information spread

855
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:53,158
and decision making. It is driven by

856
00:37:53,244 --> 00:37:55,486
agents seeking information that confirms

857
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:58,070
their preexisting belief while avoiding

858
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,986
challenging information. This is an

859
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,066
effective way of using action to

860
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,082
minimize free energy rather than

861
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:07,450
updating beliefs in a costly manner.

862
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,206
Echo chambers amplify this bias by

863
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:14,574
creating self reinforcing loops where

864
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,474
individuals selectively expose

865
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:19,774
themselves to aligned information. So

866
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,134
research indicates that network

867
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:23,006
structures contribute to the persistence

868
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:25,486
of echo chambers, thereby affecting

869
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:28,946
policy making and public discourse. The

870
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:31,106
minimization of free energy transfers to

871
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:33,622
the network, thereby shaping the

872
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,886
environment. We can see here how there

873
00:38:36,908 --> 00:38:39,014
is a loop where the environment both

874
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,742
shapes the individual, who will in turn

875
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:42,630
continuously shape the environment.

876
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,706
Interestingly, some studies have

877
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:48,170
identified a reverse confirmation bias

878
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,002
whereby some people actually do seek out

879
00:38:51,056 --> 00:38:53,942
information in an explorative manner,

880
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:56,620
which again aligns with this idea of

881
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,478
active inference epistemic value. And

882
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:03,934
here we may try to ponder why

883
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:05,582
certain people are more likely to break

884
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,430
out of their echo chambers rather than

885
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,982
stay in them. This may align potentially

886
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:14,466
with deep temporal models, whereas we

887
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:17,860
can see value at a

888
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,170
later point in time and perhaps focus

889
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,502
more on this expected value rather than

890
00:39:24,636 --> 00:39:26,994
on the direct value of the confirmation

891
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:30,914
bias. To mitigate

892
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:33,286
such biases, we can use strategies such

893
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:36,474
as fostering epistemic change through

894
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:38,774
diverging information and encouraging

895
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:42,358
reflection to break apart echo

896
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:43,130
chambers.

897
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,114
Now we've explored a little bit

898
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:50,206
confirmation bias and echo chamber. We

899
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:53,550
can see how this extends to human

900
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,878
communication. This allows us to

901
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:58,378
explore the principles of active

902
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,418
inference which shape individual

903
00:40:00,504 --> 00:40:02,734
cognitive tendencies and the influence

904
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,734
of the broader dynamics of communication

905
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,386
and collective intelligence on the

906
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:07,170
environment.

907
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,066
So we can link communicative behavior to

908
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:14,534
biological imperative of minimizing free

909
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:16,866
energy, which emphasizes the action

910
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:20,006
oriented nature of communication. The

911
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:21,970
framework allows for adaptive behavior

912
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,662
even when the models deviate from

913
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,746
vertical representations of the

914
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:29,946
environment. So how do we

915
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:33,500
justify that people lie or that people

916
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,406
say things which don't seem to align

917
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,762
properly with what everybody else seems

918
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,182
to believe about the environment?

919
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:42,666
Effectively, this is an action. You're

920
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:44,766
trying to push a belief onto the

921
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:46,398
environment such that there is a

922
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:48,126
potential for the environments to be

923
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:50,194
shaped in a way that evidences your

924
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:53,874
beliefs. So we

925
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,660
can think of cognitive control here,

926
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,738
whereby active inference has an

927
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,322
effective goal maintenance in working

928
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:03,394
memory. It provides top down guidance

929
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:05,890
for overt behavior moving beyond

930
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,786
stereotyped responses. Our understanding

931
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:10,854
of communication is enriched by

932
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:12,914
introducing neurobiologically plausible

933
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:16,534
computational hypotheses. The ecological

934
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:18,618
approach to active inference is a

935
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:21,546
framework that understands the

936
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:23,782
complexities of human communication

937
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:26,906
across different scales. It explores how

938
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:28,794
individuals contribute to the collective

939
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:30,974
intelligence of a group or society by

940
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:33,294
fostering a collaborative approach that

941
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:36,350
leverages diverse skills and knowledge.

942
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,754
This is one of the reasons echo chambers

943
00:41:39,802 --> 00:41:42,306
are maintained. They're efficient in the

944
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:44,446
transmission of information and promote

945
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:46,974
collaboration among agents who overtly

946
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:48,020
share a model.

947
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,382
So now we're going to look at a more

948
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:56,274
detailed understanding of ecological

949
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:58,790
dimensions of this discourse.

950
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,478
Context, as we saw earlier, plays a

951
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:06,202
crucial role in the activation of

952
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,822
predictive inferences. Which offers

953
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:10,454
further support for ecological

954
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:13,526
approaches. Active inference models

955
00:42:13,638 --> 00:42:15,274
contain terms that encode both the

956
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:17,526
object of desire and the strength of

957
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,734
desire at the psychological level. So

958
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,474
the context of inactive inference

959
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:24,314
suggests that generative and recognition

960
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:26,826
models are best cast as realizing

961
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,334
inference and control under the free

962
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:31,666
energy principle. So in

963
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,426
this way, communication through the

964
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:36,014
active inference lens gives us an action

965
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:38,206
oriented nature of cooperative

966
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,022
communication where together we mutually

967
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,318
craft our models such that we can

968
00:42:43,484 --> 00:42:45,350
achieve a common goal.

969
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,866
So now and lastly, let's dive

970
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:53,974
into a very short overview of how this

971
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:56,330
may translate to language processing.

972
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,606
So remember, we discussed deep temporal

973
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:03,094
models. Here they enable us to explore

974
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:05,686
the sequential dynamics of language

975
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:09,146
processing. The models are hierarchical

976
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,866
where inference at higher levels informs

977
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:14,430
the selection of words at lower levels.

978
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,566
This hierarchical structure allows for

979
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:20,166
the accumulation of evidence over nested

980
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:23,346
timescales. One key aspect is the

981
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,074
emergence of behavioral and

982
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:27,474
neurophysiological correlates in those

983
00:43:27,512 --> 00:43:30,286
sequential dynamics like the theta gamma

984
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,410
couplings that we discussed earlier.

985
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,910
It's a phenomenon that again was

986
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,114
observed and allows us to measure belief

987
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:41,782
updating under variational message

988
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:45,654
passing. Thus, generative models

989
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:47,114
aren't just predictive but also

990
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:49,402
explanatory. They can help us understand

991
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:51,174
neural mechanisms like language

992
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:52,170
comprehension.

993
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,296
So in cognitive control, linguistic can

994
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:58,908
be scoused as individual agents

995
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,676
contributing to this intelligence of the

996
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:03,956
group. And the research shows that

997
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,636
generative models are central to the

998
00:44:05,658 --> 00:44:07,556
perception and interpretation of the

999
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:11,132
linguistic signals. We have a structural

1000
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,464
understanding of sequences of words and

1001
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:17,396
their context sensitivity. This enables

1002
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:19,464
the agent to resolve uncertainty about

1003
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:21,540
the underlying conceptual,

1004
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,144
semantic or lexical causes of sensory

1005
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:29,000
input. It can incorporate

1006
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,564
beliefs about narratives, the type of

1007
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,836
question, the scenic state of the world,

1008
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:36,228
a semiotic factor indicating the topic

1009
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:39,644
of discussion. These factors generate

1010
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:41,536
expectations for the lower level, such

1011
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:43,600
as syntax and semantics.

1012
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,224
Models enable inference through this

1013
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,528
deep temp structure about the narrative

1014
00:44:50,704 --> 00:44:52,740
such as those seen in reading.

1015
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,170
Here, the neural processes can be

1016
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,058
understood in terms of simulating the

1017
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:03,446
epistemic origin seen in reading and

1018
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:05,270
other language related activities.

1019
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,462
So, to conclude, we have

1020
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:14,374
seen comprehensive understanding of

1021
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:17,034
active inference inactivism and their

1022
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:19,318
interplay in shaping social cognition

1023
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:22,582
behavior. We have explored various

1024
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:24,506
philosophical perspectives such as the

1025
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:26,358
inactive affordance based perspective,

1026
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:28,634
the Helmholtzium Beijing model, and

1027
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:30,414
highlighted their contribution to

1028
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:32,510
understanding our social interactions.

1029
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,206
We've explored deep temporal models as a

1030
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:37,994
potent computational tool for modeling

1031
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:40,078
complex time dependent patterns in

1032
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,806
social cognition, such as in language.

1033
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,706
As well, we've discussed the role of

1034
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,282
mirror neurons, emphasizing their

1035
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:49,134
potential centrality in continuously

1036
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:50,546
updating internal models of the

1037
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:52,286
environment and their significance in

1038
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:53,350
social cognition.

1039
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,418
We discussed potential future directions

1040
00:45:58,594 --> 00:46:00,646
for research if you are interested in

1041
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:03,862
these topics. So here

1042
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,554
the interplay between active inference

1043
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:07,674
and activism. Computational models like

1044
00:46:07,712 --> 00:46:10,122
deep temporal models give us a

1045
00:46:10,176 --> 00:46:11,754
multidimensional view of social

1046
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:15,226
cognition and agency. It broadens the

1047
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:16,954
scope of research but also brings us

1048
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:19,854
closer to our goal of understanding the

1049
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:22,590
complex cognitive and social phenomena.

1050
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:28,078
So for next class, I offer you

1051
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:32,194
an opportunity. You should pick

1052
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:35,058
a text from this session from the

1053
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,722
references that will be made available

1054
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:39,298
or one that you find yourself in the

1055
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:42,994
literature. Read it and try

1056
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:45,954
to explain how it ties to the concepts

1057
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:49,206
that we explored today. Ideally, you can

1058
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:51,734
present it to the group, take five

1059
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:53,766
minutes, explain what the text says and

1060
00:46:53,788 --> 00:46:55,946
how it connects to the contents of the

1061
00:46:55,968 --> 00:46:59,306
course. If you have any questions, we

1062
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:01,100
can potentially take them now.

1063
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,470
Thank you. Mahault. That was epic.

1064
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,498
All right, well, people can write

1065
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,602
questions in the chat. I'll just read

1066
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:19,420
one. All right.

1067
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,340
Where does identity and ideology fit.

1068
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,114
In my presentation or in the framework

1069
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:31,918
that I'm presenting? So I'm going to

1070
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:33,310
assume it's in the framework.

1071
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,682
Identity fits as a social self, right?

1072
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:40,974
Identity is literally how you craft

1073
00:47:41,022 --> 00:47:43,662
yourselfhood relative to the narratives

1074
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:46,866
that you're given. So it's precisely the

1075
00:47:46,888 --> 00:47:49,578
social self that we discussed. Ideology

1076
00:47:49,774 --> 00:47:53,350
corresponds to a looser,

1077
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,094
let's say, weak script that allows you

1078
00:47:57,132 --> 00:48:00,438
to shift the valence of certain

1079
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:04,646
values across certain norms. So let's

1080
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:08,534
assume that you understand values

1081
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:11,274
as a higher or lower probability for a

1082
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:14,582
type of level

1083
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:17,338
behavior. So I value kindness. There'll

1084
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:20,782
be a high prior over kindness, and

1085
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:24,542
therefore the paths, the policies that

1086
00:48:24,596 --> 00:48:27,930
lead to what I ascribe to as kindness

1087
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,386
will therefore become more likely to be

1088
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,466
adopted and will become a norm if more

1089
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:35,442
of us value the same thing. The key

1090
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,466
issue here is how do I associate the

1091
00:48:38,488 --> 00:48:42,200
semantics of kindness to the actual

1092
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,722
pragmatic representations and actions

1093
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:48,646
that correspond to what I believe to be

1094
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:50,294
kindness? And this is where the co

1095
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:52,294
construction happens, right? We

1096
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,614
communicate together, and I'm going to

1097
00:48:54,652 --> 00:48:57,866
say this is kindness. I'm acting on the

1098
00:48:57,888 --> 00:49:00,346
world to determine now this is what we

1099
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:02,202
will believe to be kindness. And I value

1100
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:04,154
kindness very highly because that's my

1101
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,526
ideology and therefore, this is what we

1102
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:08,190
should be doing. All these things

1103
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,218
connect together through the interaction

1104
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,154
of the environment, the symbols

1105
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,094
encrusted in the environment that I

1106
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:15,694
share and co construct through

1107
00:49:15,732 --> 00:49:16,670
communication.

1108
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,994
Wow. And how does that have

1109
00:49:23,032 --> 00:49:25,874
an impact on affordances, was the follow

1110
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:27,060
up question there.

1111
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,158
So if we go back to the part of the

1112
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:33,480
course about affordances, we saw that

1113
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,834
certain things are made more likely

1114
00:49:36,962 --> 00:49:40,294
given the niche that you are in. If you

1115
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,760
understand the onto cues, you see that

1116
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,514
there's going to be some signals that

1117
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:47,658
pull you as attractors in a specific

1118
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:50,266
direction. So let's assume that we have

1119
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:53,478
an ideology again that promotes kindness

1120
00:49:53,654 --> 00:49:56,506
in the environment. It is highly likely

1121
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,626
that potential pathways towards kindness

1122
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:02,974
will be made more available. So,

1123
00:50:03,012 --> 00:50:05,326
for instance, let's assume that we

1124
00:50:05,348 --> 00:50:09,102
believe that giving money to people is

1125
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:10,994
kindness. There's going to be more

1126
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:13,554
initiatives for you to give money. So,

1127
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:14,706
for instance, I don't know if you guys

1128
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:17,442
have taken the plane recently, but Air

1129
00:50:17,496 --> 00:50:22,500
Canada has started program

1130
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,830
where if you have loose change in your

1131
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,998
pockets, you can put it in the seat in

1132
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:29,414
front of you in a little pocket thing

1133
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:30,726
and you can put the money there and

1134
00:50:30,748 --> 00:50:33,286
they're going to donate it. Now, I'm not

1135
00:50:33,308 --> 00:50:34,854
saying that's kindness, we can argue

1136
00:50:34,902 --> 00:50:36,778
about the politics of it all and the

1137
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,914
tax, et cetera, but this is an

1138
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:42,714
affordance that wasn't there before and

1139
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:44,886
now it's in my environment. Now. I don't

1140
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:47,502
have to take it, but it's now more

1141
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:49,774
readily available for me to actually act

1142
00:50:49,812 --> 00:50:52,014
on it. And you can see this across every

1143
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:54,490
level. It's just that most affordances

1144
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,774
are invisible to us as affordances. We

1145
00:50:57,812 --> 00:51:00,430
just react to them, we just exist within

1146
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,954
them. But we don't consider they

1147
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,546
wouldn't be there, such as a bathroom in

1148
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:06,626
a house. This is one of the things that

1149
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:08,660
allows us to think more critically about

1150
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,066
what it means to be homeless. Like to

1151
00:51:12,088 --> 00:51:13,458
you, it seems obvious when you need to

1152
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:14,518
go to the bathroom, you'll go to the

1153
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:15,634
bathroom, right? There's a bathroom

1154
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:18,070
available to you, but there isn't one

1155
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,358
for people who live outside because they

1156
00:51:20,364 --> 00:51:21,938
don't have a home. And yet we've

1157
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,614
criminalized the act of relieving

1158
00:51:24,662 --> 00:51:26,618
yourself outside. So we've basically

1159
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:30,166
said, well, don't pee. Or if you pee,

1160
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:31,882
well, you're now a criminal. So being

1161
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:35,130
homeless by virtue of not having access

1162
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,306
to the same affordances means it's

1163
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:39,422
effectively criminal to be homeless. So

1164
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,360
these are the kinds of ways that

1165
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,686
ideology shapes our affordances and

1166
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,134
effectively pulls us in a state of

1167
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:49,602
attraction and effectively in different

1168
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:52,274
states of power as well. Because we

1169
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:54,882
collectively have decided that the only

1170
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:57,554
people who get to have the right to

1171
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:59,266
certain affordances are the people who

1172
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:00,802
have enough money to live in a house,

1173
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,370
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1174
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,166
Thanks. There's a lot there. All right.

1175
00:52:07,188 --> 00:52:08,654
I'll read a comment. This is something

1176
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,326
you could address right now or save it

1177
00:52:11,348 --> 00:52:13,118
for the discussion or however you want.

1178
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:16,274
Michael wrote would you be open to

1179
00:52:16,312 --> 00:52:18,818
attempting to map a social or personal

1180
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:21,426
narrative rather than another element in

1181
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:23,538
the literature, e. G translating The

1182
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,890
Hero's Journey or Twelve Step Recovery?

1183
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,222
I'm not sure I understand attempting to

1184
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:29,990
map.

1185
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:36,162
Connect the active ontology informalisms

1186
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:40,710
to a more broadly understood narrative

1187
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,730
or specific script.

1188
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:44,700
Yeah.

1189
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:52,894
Big fan of the hero's journey. But why

1190
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:54,960
do we want say,

1191
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,738
why do we feel like the Hero's Journey

1192
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:02,378
in itself is valuable? We feel that it's

1193
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:05,458
valuable because we feel that it

1194
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:09,282
is a very easy explanation for why

1195
00:53:09,336 --> 00:53:12,370
somebody would have value. And it is

1196
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,694
usually easy to minimize

1197
00:53:15,742 --> 00:53:17,318
free energy through well, there's a

1198
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,642
clear path. Right? This person wasn't

1199
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:23,938
the result of very complex interactions

1200
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,986
of the environment or whatever. It's

1201
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:28,838
actually no, it's all him. He just

1202
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:31,046
understood the he understood what he had

1203
00:53:31,068 --> 00:53:33,002
to do. He figured out what he had to do

1204
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:34,586
and there you go. He was able to do it.

1205
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:37,722
And so this is a signal for

1206
00:53:37,856 --> 00:53:41,538
perfect fitness to the landscape,

1207
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:45,006
right? It's perfect cognitive grip. So

1208
00:53:45,028 --> 00:53:47,610
it's like there's an underlying

1209
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,102
assumption that this one person was able

1210
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:54,354
to update their generative model

1211
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:57,330
sufficiently such that they were

1212
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,142
perfectly able to grab every affordance

1213
00:54:00,206 --> 00:54:02,770
that the environment gave them to go

1214
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,758
towards their state objective.

1215
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:07,406
So in terms of active inference, it's

1216
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:08,878
pretty simple. It's someone that has the

1217
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:11,330
capacity to go from a very unfit

1218
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,430
generative model to a very fit

1219
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,046
generative model relative to the

1220
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,886
environment. And so we like that

1221
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:18,342
narrative because it's like, okay,

1222
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:20,058
well, then that means everybody can do

1223
00:54:20,064 --> 00:54:24,874
it, right? If we can go from being

1224
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:27,706
a failure to being a hero, and all we

1225
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:31,142
have to do is take one or two hardships

1226
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:34,334
and go through it, then it's possible.

1227
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:37,214
Now, there's also some deification here,

1228
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:38,954
right, because usually the hero's

1229
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:41,918
journey goes through some very difficult

1230
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:43,786
elements and comes out on the other

1231
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:47,602
side. And we assume that because they

1232
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:50,046
can, there's a rationale of meritocracy,

1233
00:54:50,158 --> 00:54:54,814
which is the world is relatively

1234
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,914
equal for everybody. So it tries to pull

1235
00:54:56,952 --> 00:55:00,066
away from every other power factor,

1236
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:02,662
ecological factor, and it's like, no,

1237
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:05,462
it's all about how you're able to fix

1238
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:06,886
your generative model to do the right

1239
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:09,950
things that you have to do. So that's

1240
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,186
why I'm not a fan of it, but I hope was

1241
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,786
this the mapping you were looking for in

1242
00:55:13,808 --> 00:55:17,626
terms of active inference and free

1243
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,660
energy minimization kind of thing?

1244
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,506
Here's one thought on that. The hero's

1245
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:27,834
journey or another, archetypal

1246
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:30,960
attractor, just archetype or just

1247
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,974
thread. That way, it embeds a concise

1248
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:38,574
narrative account that is made legible

1249
00:55:38,622 --> 00:55:40,546
through storytelling that we can

1250
00:55:40,568 --> 00:55:44,062
understand. And it embodies

1251
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:46,114
not just kind of mythical things, but

1252
00:55:46,152 --> 00:55:49,190
also like, real, structural,

1253
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,126
implicit features. That's why some

1254
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:55,174
stories can be so short and so

1255
00:55:55,212 --> 00:55:57,062
transferable across contexts, because

1256
00:55:57,116 --> 00:56:00,314
they abstract, but also it's what they

1257
00:56:00,352 --> 00:56:02,922
do include in those cases. And then you

1258
00:56:02,976 --> 00:56:05,002
talked about how that conveys something

1259
00:56:05,056 --> 00:56:09,318
about value, which is what supports

1260
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:12,654
social norms and social values, which,

1261
00:56:12,692 --> 00:56:15,630
of course, you can't point at anywhere.

1262
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,254
Yet what can you say about what

1263
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:23,614
are social norms or forces or what

1264
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:24,740
is the social?

1265
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,980
What is the social?

1266
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,530
Um,

1267
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,686
I think you can point to it. I think you

1268
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,998
can effectively point to processes. You

1269
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:46,210
can point to material realities,

1270
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,670
institutions.

1271
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,418
I think we tend to use

1272
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:59,302
the notion of the social to contrast

1273
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,660
it with the notion of the individual.

1274
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,614
It's just that nothing's ever that

1275
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:08,014
simple. The individual is always

1276
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:12,378
built because of other individuals.

1277
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,070
So there's no really such thing as

1278
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,282
uninvival. You're always embedded within

1279
00:57:17,336 --> 00:57:19,940
something. So the real question is,

1280
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,250
what's the scale that you're interested

1281
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,554
in and what is identifiable as

1282
00:57:27,672 --> 00:57:29,782
what may be within or without or outside

1283
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:32,134
of your control within that scale? And

1284
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:35,986
we generally make a sort of conflation

1285
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:38,726
between what is social and what is

1286
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:40,746
uncontrollable. Even that's not

1287
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:42,186
necessarily true, as we saw, right?

1288
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,306
Because through our actions, which can

1289
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,970
be verbal, which can be physical.

1290
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:53,722
We reiterate or push

1291
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:57,294
on what constitutes what is valued by

1292
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,562
other actors within the same locality.

1293
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:03,210
So if you're asking what constitutes

1294
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,942
culture, well, at the level of

1295
00:58:06,996 --> 00:58:10,402
my house, culture is we go to bed

1296
00:58:10,456 --> 00:58:12,706
around ten to eleven, because if you

1297
00:58:12,728 --> 00:58:14,658
don't go to bed at eleven, you're going

1298
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:15,806
to make noise and you're going to wake

1299
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:19,054
me up. So our shared culture is this.

1300
00:58:19,112 --> 00:58:20,662
This is something that we repeat over

1301
00:58:20,716 --> 00:58:22,742
time that constitutes an attractor for

1302
00:58:22,796 --> 00:58:26,022
more than just me. If I look at the

1303
00:58:26,076 --> 00:58:29,682
level of my building, nobody puts

1304
00:58:29,746 --> 00:58:31,858
plants outside on their balcony. If it's

1305
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:35,046
at the level of Montreal, there's

1306
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,506
potholes everywhere. And we're not

1307
00:58:36,528 --> 00:58:37,946
bitching really about it. We've all

1308
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:39,206
accepted there's potholes everywhere.

1309
00:58:39,238 --> 00:58:40,854
So it's part of our culture, it becomes

1310
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:44,174
part of our conscious. And so why is it

1311
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,646
cultural? It's because we

1312
00:58:47,668 --> 00:58:51,054
can see that this behavior, these

1313
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:54,110
expectations, translate not just to you,

1314
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,838
to your own model, but it translates to

1315
00:58:55,844 --> 00:58:57,726
the model of other people as well, and

1316
00:58:57,748 --> 00:58:59,886
they can expect the same for you. It's

1317
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:02,446
something which is definitely shared.

1318
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:04,146
So I think you can easily point to

1319
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:06,546
things once you define the scale at

1320
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:08,210
which it becomes manifest.

1321
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,492
Thanks. Really interesting. All right,

1322
00:59:13,546 --> 00:59:16,260
a question from Upcycle club who wrote,

1323
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,824
in terms of the philosophical dimensions

1324
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:22,180
of agency in active inference,

1325
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,880
what is the role of self referentiality?

1326
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,028
I think you'd have to define the term,

1327
00:59:29,044 --> 00:59:32,904
but if I understand correctly, we saw

1328
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:36,780
that you have to both model yourself and

1329
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,244
model the rest of the world in order to

1330
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:43,164
understand whether your actions are

1331
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:46,316
likely to have the effects you want to

1332
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:48,376
have on the world. So this self

1333
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,952
referentiality, if I understand

1334
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,384
correctly, but I could be wrong, is this

1335
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,688
notion of accurately modeling yourself

1336
00:59:54,774 --> 00:59:58,050
as that? Does that answer the question?

1337
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,710
Yeah. All right. A question from

1338
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,084
Michael, who wrote, I work with

1339
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:07,876
marginalized communities who experience

1340
01:00:07,978 --> 01:00:10,884
the larger culture as dominant and

1341
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:14,680
scientifically enabled. How should such

1342
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,496
communities fortify themselves against

1343
01:00:17,678 --> 01:00:20,760
the more skillful extractive cultures?

1344
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,676
I mean, that's the main question

1345
01:00:27,778 --> 01:00:30,700
that's been for countercultures forever.

1346
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,672
It depends what you mean by fortify

1347
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:39,600
yourself. If you mean be less

1348
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,890
likely to be extracted from,

1349
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,204
I think the question is being extracted

1350
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:47,952
from without getting something in

1351
01:00:48,006 --> 01:00:51,044
return. Because effectively, as you saw,

1352
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:54,132
for coordination to happen, you must

1353
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:57,012
provide something for the group in order

1354
01:00:57,066 --> 01:01:00,096
for the group to move further. So it's

1355
01:01:00,128 --> 01:01:02,276
always a little bit extractive. You will

1356
01:01:02,298 --> 01:01:04,952
always expend some degree of free energy

1357
01:01:05,086 --> 01:01:07,208
in order to move towards the policy that

1358
01:01:07,214 --> 01:01:09,224
you've chosen as a group. So there's two

1359
01:01:09,262 --> 01:01:12,728
elements here chosen as a group, and

1360
01:01:12,814 --> 01:01:14,708
there should be a return on that as

1361
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:16,892
well. Right? It shouldn't be just you

1362
01:01:16,946 --> 01:01:19,052
pay, nobody else gives you something.

1363
01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:21,180
So it's the degree to which the system

1364
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,932
minimizes everybody's free energy rather

1365
01:01:23,986 --> 01:01:27,016
than minimizes this group's. And this

1366
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,600
group is still a high free energy, low

1367
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:32,348
allostatic high allostatic load, et

1368
01:01:32,364 --> 01:01:36,096
cetera. I'm not the

1369
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:37,696
expert on that. Specifically, I'm sure

1370
01:01:37,718 --> 01:01:39,136
there are people who have worked with

1371
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:41,044
marginalized group way more than I have

1372
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:43,910
who could give you better insights. But

1373
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,856
from what I've read and if I can derive

1374
01:01:47,888 --> 01:01:49,376
from the theory that we've presented

1375
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:53,016
today, you need

1376
01:01:53,038 --> 01:01:57,400
to have a strong narrative that supports

1377
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,964
your capacity to increase your fitness

1378
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:04,304
landscape and increases and maintains

1379
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:07,020
the bonds, the mark of blanket around

1380
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,376
your group. If your group is likely

1381
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:12,056
to dissolve all the time, if it's

1382
01:02:12,088 --> 01:02:16,664
constantly threatened

1383
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:19,136
and shaky it's not going to be able to

1384
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:21,024
go very far. It's always going to be in

1385
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:24,480
protective mode. So you need to

1386
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,988
ensure that the group has strong bonds,

1387
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:29,476
that the group can expand and that the

1388
01:02:29,498 --> 01:02:33,600
group can together enact policies

1389
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,516
that lead it to minimizing free energy

1390
01:02:36,698 --> 01:02:40,070
and relative to the larger group,

1391
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,232
that generally entails having more and

1392
01:02:44,286 --> 01:02:47,672
more connections with individuals from

1393
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:52,696
the larger group such that you

1394
01:02:52,718 --> 01:02:56,056
are capable of changing

1395
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:59,676
their model little by little. You want

1396
01:02:59,698 --> 01:03:02,024
to have a strong boundary but you don't

1397
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:04,396
want to be unable to communicate with

1398
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,896
the external group because if you do

1399
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:10,144
that you can't communicate and co

1400
01:03:10,182 --> 01:03:14,144
construct. So it

1401
01:03:14,182 --> 01:03:16,636
seems trivial, but it's developing,

1402
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,752
Allyships, where you have people from

1403
01:03:18,806 --> 01:03:21,140
the larger group that become people,

1404
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,716
that adopt your message and allow the

1405
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:26,240
expansion of your group and the ideology

1406
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,196
or the generative model of your group to

1407
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:31,316
be integrated within what determines the

1408
01:03:31,338 --> 01:03:33,016
policies of the higher level group or at

1409
01:03:33,038 --> 01:03:35,210
least of the dominant extractive group.

1410
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,632
I hope this helps. I know it's not as

1411
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:42,436
concrete as one might want but I'm

1412
01:03:42,468 --> 01:03:44,876
sure people with much more experience in

1413
01:03:44,898 --> 01:03:46,332
these fields would have much better

1414
01:03:46,386 --> 01:03:47,470
answers for you.

1415
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,212
I have a question that I've long had

1416
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:56,956
about some of your different research

1417
01:03:57,058 --> 01:03:58,850
projects which you presented here.

1418
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:02,556
Often there's this modeling

1419
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,472
of both the view from the inside with

1420
01:04:05,526 --> 01:04:08,784
phenomenology and also a view from the

1421
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:12,656
outside. So what can you

1422
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:14,870
say about active inference and that,

1423
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,356
what does that mean? Where does that

1424
01:04:18,378 --> 01:04:21,044
come from? How does that matter for the

1425
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:22,570
personal and the social?

1426
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,870
So imagine a mark of blanket.

1427
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,646
Every mark of blanket entails there's an

1428
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,806
outside and an inside. Now you can

1429
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,178
always redraw it, you can always

1430
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:38,606
consider it's wider,

1431
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:41,662
smaller. Inside your mark of blankets

1432
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:43,554
there are mark of blankets. It's all

1433
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:46,578
mark of blankets all the way down. So

1434
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:49,942
this notion of internal and external is

1435
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:52,934
only useful in relation to the

1436
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,802
measurement of a joint probability

1437
01:04:54,946 --> 01:05:01,346
that's it it's

1438
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:04,806
not ontological. In a sense I can

1439
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:08,682
consider that my cells also have

1440
01:05:08,736 --> 01:05:10,406
like an internal model and an external

1441
01:05:10,438 --> 01:05:14,282
model and I'm just some emergent scale.

1442
01:05:14,426 --> 01:05:17,022
Given the connection between all these

1443
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:18,334
models that have an internal and

1444
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,360
external model,

1445
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,806
this group right now has a mark of

1446
01:05:23,828 --> 01:05:26,842
blankets which means us. We have spoken

1447
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:28,866
and people who have not spoken to us do

1448
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:31,058
not have access to this information here

1449
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:32,738
and in order to exchange information,

1450
01:05:32,824 --> 01:05:34,546
they'll probably have to speak to some

1451
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:38,378
of us. And so there'll

1452
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:40,918
be an action that we put upon the world

1453
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,938
as a group with some degree of cohesion

1454
01:05:44,034 --> 01:05:47,606
over time. So I think we

1455
01:05:47,628 --> 01:05:49,366
have to understand internal and

1456
01:05:49,388 --> 01:05:51,546
external, really in those terms, in

1457
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:55,370
terms of temporality and objective.

1458
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:58,934
Outside of that, these are illusory

1459
01:05:58,982 --> 01:06:01,898
boundaries. They're not real.

1460
01:06:02,064 --> 01:06:04,446
And because they're not real, we can

1461
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:07,870
sort of issue essentialism.

1462
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:11,386
If a boundary can always be redrawn

1463
01:06:11,498 --> 01:06:14,240
relative to some kind of observer, then

1464
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,330
everything is always observer relative.

1465
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,194
And there is no such thing as a thing,

1466
01:06:20,232 --> 01:06:22,226
which is a thing in itself. It's always

1467
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:25,682
relational, it's always phenomenal. And

1468
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:27,866
how does this tie to phenomenality?

1469
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:31,414
Well, because we

1470
01:06:31,452 --> 01:06:33,286
are talking through this mark of

1471
01:06:33,308 --> 01:06:35,106
blanket, because we're like, we don't

1472
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:38,406
actually have access to the rest of the

1473
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:41,434
world except through this boundary. The

1474
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:44,790
internal model is what effectively

1475
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,642
wiggles relative to the external world.

1476
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:51,910
And therefore you get phenomenality

1477
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,226
from this remodeling of the external

1478
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:58,666
world, from this given boundary.

1479
01:06:58,778 --> 01:07:02,058
So, for instance, our group's

1480
01:07:02,154 --> 01:07:05,246
phenomenality of everybody else is our

1481
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:07,314
shared representation of who that even

1482
01:07:07,352 --> 01:07:09,842
means, of what that even means. We have

1483
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:13,266
this phenomenal representation of that

1484
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:16,420
group. We could even potentially create

1485
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,126
symbols for them. We could create actual

1486
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:23,702
representations which would become kind

1487
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:27,538
of what would constitutes qualia

1488
01:07:27,634 --> 01:07:30,438
at the level of our group. So yeah,

1489
01:07:30,524 --> 01:07:31,958
I think I've answered your question. I

1490
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,800
get lost in my thoughts sometimes, but

1491
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,682
it's great. All right, I'm going to read

1492
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:39,126
a comment from Abel, who just requested

1493
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:42,566
this comment to be read. Avel wrote I'd

1494
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:43,886
like to add some things about the

1495
01:07:43,908 --> 01:07:46,522
ideology question. You have a diversity

1496
01:07:46,586 --> 01:07:48,766
of definitions of ideology. For the

1497
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:50,538
purposes of the demonstration, I'll

1498
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:53,742
cluster them into two. One, post

1499
01:07:53,796 --> 01:07:55,614
structuralist. In this context, an

1500
01:07:55,652 --> 01:07:57,906
ideology is any system of value or of

1501
01:07:57,928 --> 01:07:59,426
instrumentation of the world. This is

1502
01:07:59,448 --> 01:08:01,314
the definition Mahault used in this

1503
01:08:01,352 --> 01:08:03,538
case. Everything is ideology because the

1504
01:08:03,544 --> 01:08:06,098
basic way we perceive the world is value

1505
01:08:06,184 --> 01:08:09,266
ridden. And two, structuralist.

1506
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:12,054
In this context, an ideology is a system

1507
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:14,390
of discourse that dominates a given

1508
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,314
social context. For structuralist

1509
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:19,670
definitions to apply, you need a lot

1510
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,626
more than shared values. You need a

1511
01:08:21,648 --> 01:08:24,314
clergy that maintains and diffuses the

1512
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:26,634
specific discourse underlying the

1513
01:08:26,672 --> 01:08:29,658
ideology. I have a limited insight in

1514
01:08:29,664 --> 01:08:31,786
the historical evidence, but as of my

1515
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,126
understanding, ideology as factor of

1516
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,046
mass mobilization is pretty much an

1517
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:38,190
early modern particularism.

1518
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,418
I feel like that's if we cast it in

1519
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:52,500
terms of active inference, it would be

1520
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,450
the active states, right? Like you need

1521
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,746
you need something which acts upon the

1522
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,214
world in order to create the self

1523
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:03,718
evidencing you require. And that would

1524
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:06,086
be like the clergy, right? You need to

1525
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,846
push these beliefs onto the world. You

1526
01:09:07,868 --> 01:09:09,814
can't just sort of let them happen.

1527
01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:11,566
Especially if we talk about precision,

1528
01:09:11,618 --> 01:09:13,322
right? Because remember, everything

1529
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,046
wiggles, everything's always non

1530
01:09:15,078 --> 01:09:16,826
stationary. We move, we change, we

1531
01:09:16,848 --> 01:09:18,646
interpret, we reinterpret. Those degrees

1532
01:09:18,678 --> 01:09:21,514
of uncertainty. So how do we make sure

1533
01:09:21,632 --> 01:09:24,858
that we continue over time that we don't

1534
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,434
just dilute, that our boundary stays

1535
01:09:27,482 --> 01:09:28,598
very strong? That's what I was

1536
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,926
discussing earlier with the groups that

1537
01:09:30,948 --> 01:09:33,886
want to be avoid extractivism. You need

1538
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,142
to proselytize. You need to make sure

1539
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:39,098
that the same narratives we return, we

1540
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:40,926
always return to that same narrative.

1541
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:44,354
And how. If we look at the clergy, for

1542
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:46,098
instance, I don't know if it was a

1543
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,562
mistake or not, but for a time, the only

1544
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,694
way to preach was in Latin, which means

1545
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:53,830
the only way to access the Word of God

1546
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,200
was through these people who not only

1547
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,398
had to give you the Word of God, but

1548
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,930
they also controlled what it meant.

1549
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,826
Because you don't speak Latin, I don't

1550
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:04,986
speak Latin. I'm going to believe you.

1551
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:08,314
You have that knowledge. So it

1552
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:10,282
goes back to these structures of power

1553
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,282
where there are some people that have

1554
01:10:12,336 --> 01:10:15,198
more access to influencing others,

1555
01:10:15,284 --> 01:10:17,134
right? They can push their beliefs with

1556
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,934
more precision on others and others just

1557
01:10:20,052 --> 01:10:21,646
kind of have to follow because they have

1558
01:10:21,668 --> 01:10:25,834
no real way to themselves interpret

1559
01:10:25,882 --> 01:10:27,398
and potentially shift narrative

1560
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:28,020
themselves.

1561
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,666
When you do that, I feel like I'm

1562
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:38,062
pretty. There'S a lot there.

1563
01:10:38,116 --> 01:10:40,160
One part that I thought was very

1564
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:44,974
interesting was variational.

1565
01:10:45,022 --> 01:10:48,418
Free energy is about observations. And

1566
01:10:48,504 --> 01:10:51,054
in what you had added just recently,

1567
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:53,026
you talked about the measurement of a

1568
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,666
joint probability. There has to be like

1569
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:59,126
an aboutness of sensory observations for

1570
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:02,840
that thing. Otherwise it has

1571
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,894
not even a sensory it's not even an

1572
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:09,180
inanimate thing unless it has this.

1573
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,210
That doesn't mean it's an interesting

1574
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,434
thing. And I think that's what the

1575
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:16,966
recent work helps clarify

1576
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:20,814
with this sort of taxonomy from inert to

1577
01:11:20,852 --> 01:11:24,378
more classically active control systems

1578
01:11:24,554 --> 01:11:28,350
on through just the infinite

1579
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,414
possibilities of broadly cognitive

1580
01:11:31,482 --> 01:11:33,246
modeling ecosystems of shared

1581
01:11:33,278 --> 01:11:37,106
intelligence. Yeah, I think that's a

1582
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:40,114
really interesting, really interesting

1583
01:11:40,232 --> 01:11:42,900
distinction you just made. So the paper

1584
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:46,040
by Lance and Co,

1585
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:52,166
maybe that is the key, because maybe

1586
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,674
this is a hot take, but I generally lean

1587
01:11:54,722 --> 01:11:57,382
towards panpsychism. I do believe that

1588
01:11:57,516 --> 01:11:59,306
if consciousness is the substrate, then

1589
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:01,462
everything is some degree of conscious

1590
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,414
and we can stop using the word conscious

1591
01:12:03,462 --> 01:12:05,722
and we can use the word model right

1592
01:12:05,776 --> 01:12:08,906
there's, the degree to which there's a

1593
01:12:08,928 --> 01:12:12,938
response between the internal

1594
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:14,638
states of the microblanket and the

1595
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,542
external states. So there is some

1596
01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:18,126
exchange of information there and

1597
01:12:18,148 --> 01:12:19,498
whatever is done with the exchange,

1598
01:12:19,594 --> 01:12:23,694
maybe nothing. And this may be the

1599
01:12:23,732 --> 01:12:26,782
aboutness your internal model has

1600
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:30,298
no aboutness. It's just there is

1601
01:12:30,324 --> 01:12:32,546
information that was inputted and the

1602
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,226
only thing that it outputs is a

1603
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:36,546
constants of its boundary. And that's

1604
01:12:36,578 --> 01:12:38,854
it. And therefore, in order to have

1605
01:12:38,892 --> 01:12:41,814
aboutness, you have to have the

1606
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:45,814
possibility for your internal states to

1607
01:12:45,852 --> 01:12:48,790
shift, to move your boundary somehow

1608
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,194
towards something more specific, to

1609
01:12:51,232 --> 01:12:54,714
segregate, to discretize the

1610
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:56,474
external world into things that have

1611
01:12:56,512 --> 01:12:59,420
more or less valence relative to your

1612
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,394
very, very akin to what Donald Hoffman

1613
01:13:02,442 --> 01:13:03,760
is suggesting, basically.

1614
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,462
Building on that. And throughout your

1615
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:14,986
presentation, I got a sense of the

1616
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:17,274
kind of two cultures, the sciences and

1617
01:13:17,312 --> 01:13:20,074
the humanities, not that they were

1618
01:13:20,112 --> 01:13:21,802
exactly being represented in the talk,

1619
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:25,802
but in terms of excellent style and

1620
01:13:25,936 --> 01:13:29,306
classical approach and the non

1621
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:32,894
overlapping magisteria idea that

1622
01:13:32,932 --> 01:13:38,910
they're sort of a separable technical

1623
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:44,178
from the social. And even though

1624
01:13:44,264 --> 01:13:48,286
it's widely clear that the beliefs

1625
01:13:48,318 --> 01:13:51,314
in the moment shape the niche that has

1626
01:13:51,352 --> 01:13:53,378
these feedback things, the development

1627
01:13:53,474 --> 01:13:56,614
of top down architectures in

1628
01:13:56,652 --> 01:13:59,014
some way that become top down

1629
01:13:59,052 --> 01:14:02,454
affordances for those or other people at

1630
01:14:02,492 --> 01:14:04,200
some future time.

1631
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:11,850
So where do we go from there?

1632
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,340
And just like thinking about that space,

1633
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,046
how do you approach chapter six of the

1634
01:14:20,068 --> 01:14:23,454
textbook in terms of the recipe for the

1635
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:28,726
active inference generative model for

1636
01:14:28,748 --> 01:14:31,690
a social setting? For a social setting?

1637
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:33,660
Okay,

1638
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:43,074
I think we

1639
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:47,094
go from semantics and we

1640
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:50,790
map the semantics of a group

1641
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,534
and you qualify what that

1642
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:56,674
group is. Maybe the description length

1643
01:14:56,722 --> 01:14:59,046
of that group is extreme. Maybe the

1644
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:01,674
description length is my neighbor, your

1645
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:04,246
neighbor, me and three of their cats,

1646
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:05,546
but not the fourth. You know what I

1647
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:08,346
mean? Like maybe there's a cluster there

1648
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:10,620
and we map the semantics of that group

1649
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:14,062
and it's very specific. And then through

1650
01:15:14,116 --> 01:15:16,990
those semantics, there's an inherent

1651
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,078
causal structures of the structure of

1652
01:15:20,084 --> 01:15:22,174
the beliefs through which we could

1653
01:15:22,212 --> 01:15:24,950
together, like our own little experts,

1654
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,554
try to map, well, okay, what are our

1655
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:29,506
states? What are observations, how do we

1656
01:15:29,528 --> 01:15:32,306
map to this? And we try to test that

1657
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:37,134
model and then let's assume that we

1658
01:15:37,192 --> 01:15:39,350
disagree. So we're going to have

1659
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,570
different kind of breakdowns of reality

1660
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,694
and we're going to test the different

1661
01:15:42,732 --> 01:15:45,490
models in a sort of Bayesian expansion

1662
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,280
or Bayesian model reduction, or just

1663
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:51,158
testing different models and DCM style

1664
01:15:51,174 --> 01:15:53,482
and seeing which one maps better to the

1665
01:15:53,536 --> 01:15:55,802
expected observations we're going to see

1666
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:59,386
given our model. And you can do this for

1667
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:01,242
anything. You can do this for a small

1668
01:16:01,296 --> 01:16:03,086
group of neighbors, you can do this for

1669
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:06,126
a very large group of people, you can do

1670
01:16:06,148 --> 01:16:08,654
this for participant research, you can

1671
01:16:08,692 --> 01:16:11,978
do this for medicine. I think it's

1672
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:15,918
really about how do people carve nature

1673
01:16:16,014 --> 01:16:19,826
at its joints and can they point to the

1674
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:22,020
exact observations which they believe

1675
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:25,486
are part of the carvings or not? I think

1676
01:16:25,528 --> 01:16:27,218
that's possible in social sciences,

1677
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:30,934
it's just about taking the

1678
01:16:30,972 --> 01:16:34,550
time to formalize how observations

1679
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:40,810
map to the carving together. I think

1680
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,254
social sciences generally tend to push

1681
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:47,690
back against a carving.

1682
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,878
They will prefer something that

1683
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:53,870
resembles more a manifold.

1684
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,594
It ebbs and flows and it's like there's

1685
01:16:57,642 --> 01:17:00,010
some prototypical stuff, but mostly

1686
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,886
there's stuff that could come in and out

1687
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,458
and stuff, and that's fine. You can be

1688
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:08,066
accounted for. So if

1689
01:17:08,088 --> 01:17:11,010
you look at different carvings,

1690
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,986
we can work them through on a sort of

1691
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:16,194
probability and say, well, this is much

1692
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,226
less likely. It's possible, it fits

1693
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:20,054
within the carving, but it's much less

1694
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:21,734
likely. What about this? Well, this is

1695
01:17:21,772 --> 01:17:25,686
really like, let's put a probability on

1696
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,650
this. And maybe to you, the probability

1697
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,462
is that's Frank,

1698
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:34,394
it's in there. I think they'd be more

1699
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:35,914
comfortable with something that's less

1700
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:39,174
binary and something that's more curved

1701
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:41,574
and allows for new things to be added.

1702
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:43,978
Were we to disagree on inclusions, et

1703
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:47,390
cetera. That's a great

1704
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:50,414
point on kind of a narrow note, but to

1705
01:17:50,452 --> 01:17:52,206
what you just said there, let's just say

1706
01:17:52,228 --> 01:17:55,102
that there's four options. If our prior

1707
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:58,962
is 10 zero, then any

1708
01:17:59,016 --> 01:18:01,534
number of evidence times zero stays

1709
01:18:01,582 --> 01:18:03,534
zero. So that's like essentially fixed.

1710
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:05,154
And that's when the hyperparameter is

1711
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:08,246
fixed. And then if you enable even a

1712
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:11,874
tiny amount of non

1713
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:15,158
zero value, and so it's like 0.99 and

1714
01:18:15,164 --> 01:18:17,734
then a bunch of zeros, then that can

1715
01:18:17,772 --> 01:18:20,186
still rise off the baseline. And then

1716
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:21,414
that's the whole question of attention

1717
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:24,742
and cognition, is how do you stay aware

1718
01:18:24,806 --> 01:18:27,002
of relevant, salient information,

1719
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:29,740
relevance, realization and all that?

1720
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:35,280
Another point was about the

1721
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,814
causal model from the outside, the part

1722
01:18:38,852 --> 01:18:40,266
that the person doesn't directly

1723
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,366
control. There's no direct control in

1724
01:18:42,388 --> 01:18:44,910
the active generative models of action

1725
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,370
observations. It has to go through

1726
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,386
the niche. That's how the thing is

1727
01:18:50,408 --> 01:18:53,554
defined. And so only indirectly can

1728
01:18:53,592 --> 01:18:55,998
observations be changed. And so that's

1729
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:57,126
the kind of part that you don't have

1730
01:18:57,148 --> 01:18:59,446
agency over, literally. Although the

1731
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,246
other glass half full side is that is to

1732
01:19:02,268 --> 01:19:04,422
the extent that you do have agency over

1733
01:19:04,476 --> 01:19:08,426
that, and then where that glass is and

1734
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:12,250
what narrative actually puts water

1735
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,434
into the glass or not, and then what is

1736
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:18,374
the glass half full, glass half empty

1737
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:22,894
part? It brings so much and

1738
01:19:22,932 --> 01:19:24,734
just so much like on the personal

1739
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:28,586
thought side. But also it's

1740
01:19:28,618 --> 01:19:30,686
just really interesting to see how this

1741
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:33,330
line of research, which was more

1742
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,866
qualitative several years ago, like in

1743
01:19:36,888 --> 01:19:40,420
the 2016 to 18 time,

1744
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:43,810
and just to see how different motifs

1745
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,994
have come into play with the generative

1746
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:50,934
models. So it's a pretty cool

1747
01:19:51,132 --> 01:19:55,014
lecture and many people appreciated your

1748
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:56,838
work in the chat, so that's cool. Do you

1749
01:19:56,844 --> 01:19:58,406
have any other comments or anything you

1750
01:19:58,428 --> 01:20:01,066
want to talk about? No,

1751
01:20:01,248 --> 01:20:03,994
but I'm going to have to go in about two

1752
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,294
minutes. But I would like to encourage

1753
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:08,074
people to really participate in the next

1754
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:11,994
one, to read some texts and to express

1755
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:15,360
their ideas, because this is how we

1756
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,718
percolate percolate. This is how we

1757
01:20:18,724 --> 01:20:20,638
percolate good ideas and future

1758
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:23,502
research. And the field of social

1759
01:20:23,556 --> 01:20:26,654
sciences is ripe for this. There's so

1760
01:20:26,692 --> 01:20:28,174
much that can be done right now,

1761
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:31,022
translated, connected, like we can get

1762
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:34,958
towards a confluent time in research and

1763
01:20:35,044 --> 01:20:38,694
science. It all right. Really looking

1764
01:20:38,732 --> 01:20:40,946
forward to the discussion and hoping

1765
01:20:40,978 --> 01:20:45,990
that people engage in this affordance.

1766
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,214
All right, thank you. See you.
