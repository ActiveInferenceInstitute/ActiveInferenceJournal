1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,980
hello and welcome it's September 20th

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,980
2020 23. we're at the Active inference

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,560
Institute in the course active inference

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,380
for the social sciences and here with

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,500
MAO Albertson who will be presenting

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,539
today on Norm scripts and Linguistics

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,119
under active inference so thank you Mao

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,099
to you

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,679
awesome so hi everyone

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,520
um as uh last time there was a

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
presentation on semiotics and semantics

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,820
I won't dig too far into Linguistics but

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,320
I'll touch on it at the end of the

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,820
course

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,260
so

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,140
what are we going to do in this module

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,780
we're going to explore the concept of

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,460
active inference and its relevance to

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,160
social norms and human decision making

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,260
as you will

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,239
um have seen in the previous classes

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,280
active inference is a theoretical

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,140
framework that seeks to explain how

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,780
organisms including humans engage with

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,920
their environment to minimize

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,659
uncertainty and maintain their internal

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,600
States we're not going to dig into these

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,520
Concepts too too much because I assume

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,960
they have been

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,720
um previously explained at length

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
however I will explain how they connect

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
to social phenomena

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,780
so this framework has significant

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,939
implications for understanding social

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,159
behavior as it can help explain how

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,920
individuals conform to social norms and

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,380
make decisions based on the expectations

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,000
of others

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,100
we'll delve into the role of active

40
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,680
inference in human societies emphasizing

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,020
how humans and other organisms

42
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,000
constantly seek to minimize their

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,159
uncertainty about the World by updating

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,079
their beliefs and taking actions to

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,960
maintain a stable internal state

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,720
this is a crucial process for survival

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,820
it allows individuals to predict and

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,560
adapt to their environment in the

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,479
context of human societies

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,880
active inference plays a critical role

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,700
in explaining how individuals navigate

52
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,740
complex social situations conform to

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,139
social expectations and make decisions

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,560
that align with their beliefs and values

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,060
furthermore

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,220
we'll explore the concept of beyondic

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,200
value within active inference which

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
refers to the value of attributed to

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,099
actions based on their adherence to

60
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,359
social norms and expectations

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,720
by adhering to social norms individuals

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,700
can minimize the uncertainty associated

63
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,860
with their actions and maintain a sense

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
of predictability and stability in their

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,580
social environment

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,220
so together all these insights will

67
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,720
provide you with a comprehensive

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,819
understanding of the complex interplay

69
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,800
between active inference social norms

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
and human decision making

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,519
so let's Dive In

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,959
we'll start by introducing a

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,120
philosophical framework building on the

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,800
framework of active inference in

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,680
activism offers us a complementary lens

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,019
to understand the dynamic and contextual

77
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,300
nature of social cognition so while

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,500
active inference provides the

79
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,940
computational underpinnings for

80
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,319
understanding social norms and

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,840
decisional making we still need to

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,940
Anchor ourselves within a larger

83
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,340
theoretical framework inactivism

84
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,519
enriches this perspective by emphasizing

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,560
the Practical and developmental aspects

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,760
of social understanding

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,900
so what is inactivism

88
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,200
if it hasn't been introduced before

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,879
inactivism is a philosophical stance

90
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,459
that extends Beyond traditional theories

91
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,280
of cognition emphasizing the role of

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,379
inter interactions and relational

93
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,379
Dynamics in shaping both individual and

94
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,159
social cognition

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,599
it argues that cognition is a dynamic

96
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,060
real-time fluid and contextual social

97
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,260
action

98
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,440
you can read more about this uh in

99
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,000
ineshipolito's texts and Thomas van s in

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,799
2022.

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,440
generative models and hermeneutics

102
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,080
serve as a cognitive structure and

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,819
framework for interpretation

104
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,920
respectively

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
these elements are continuously updated

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
based on social interactions and signals

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,900
thereby facilitating effective

108
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,918
communication and understanding

109
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,079
hermeneutics provides a theoretical

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,639
framework for interpreting social

111
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,240
signals and cues crucial for Effective

112
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,699
social interactions

113
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,240
so perminutics allows for a nuanced

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,320
understanding of contextually

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,180
constituted meaning

116
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,639
it goes beyond the conventional notion

117
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,340
of self-contained objects to explore the

118
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,220
deeper contextual meanings in behavior

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,300
and cognition

120
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,400
hermeneutics offers a way to analyze

121
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,020
social action that goes beyond

122
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,620
positivist and humanist approaches by

123
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,780
fusing the conceptual schemes of the

124
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,020
Observer and the social actor

125
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,720
it complements inactivism by providing

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
the interpretive framework that are

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
continuously updated through social

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,139
interactions enriching our understanding

129
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,960
of cognition as Dynamic real-time and

130
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,080
cognition and contextual

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,680
in the realm of social cognition

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,419
inactivism

133
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:26,820
introduces the concept of generalized

134
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,680
synchronization

135
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,320
which

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,240
allows for a nuanced understanding of

137
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,039
how social interactions mutually

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,360
influence cognitive processes

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,039
the relationship between individual

140
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
beliefs and social expectations is

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,780
complex it's fundamentally shaped by our

142
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,820
interactions with the others and the

143
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,860
world

144
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,919
we thus see that meaning is

145
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,139
co-constituted by the individual and the

146
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,460
environment

147
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,919
if we adopt an actress and hermeneutics

148
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,199
approach we find the philosophical

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,940
foundations that lead into a

150
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,800
comprehensive overview of the

151
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,620
intersection with social cognition

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,080
if you want more references to read

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,880
about these topics you can ask me at the

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,680
end of the class and I can send you a

155
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
few

156
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,479
so it's essential to note however that

157
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,180
there are some criticisms uh that point

158
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,039
out the limitations of inactivism in

159
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,740
explaining social cognition

160
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,080
one of the key criticism is that current

161
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,300
articulations of inactivism are not yet

162
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
up to the task when it comes to

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,159
explaining complex social interactions

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
despite these criticisms inactivism

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,139
provides a consistent epistemology for a

166
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,660
psychology that is intrinsically social

167
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,580
looking forward the field of inactivism

168
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,680
and social cognition is right for

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,660
exploration and would benefit from a

170
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,100
deeper connection to active influence

171
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,560
there has been such research so

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,639
researchers uh like Maxwell ramstead has

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
developed a concept of inactive

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
inference which offers a promising

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
Avenue for integrating inactivism and

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
active inference

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,080
he's research aligns with full

178
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,000
psychology and suggests that these

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,220
Frameworks can coexist and enrich our

180
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,520
understandings of social cognition

181
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,380
future other directions can involve for

182
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,479
instance integrating inactivism with

183
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,220
other recognitive theories and exploring

184
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,259
its applicability applicability in real

185
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,599
world social scenarios through its

186
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,160
connection to active inference we can

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
make accurate and testable predictions

188
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,000
so while inactivism now provides us with

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
a foundational understanding of

190
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
cognition and social interaction the

191
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,199
concept of agency further enriches this

192
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,900
understanding by introducing more

193
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,880
philosophical perspectives that align

194
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,180
with or diverge from inactivism so

195
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,160
we can build on top of an activism

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,660
through the notion of agency

197
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:04,440
so we will now focus on the key issue of

198
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,199
inactivism which is how does agency

199
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,500
emerge how do things self-organize

200
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,419
um through their interaction with the

201
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,800
environment why are they not fully

202
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,880
determined

203
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,099
how can we account for agency in a

204
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,000
system where effectively

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
self-organization is seen as some degree

206
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,099
of determined by the materiality of the

207
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,180
agentence environment

208
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,220
agency is a complex construct that has

209
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,860
been explored through a multitude of

210
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,760
philosophical and scientific Frameworks

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,719
one prominent approach is the inactive

212
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,919
affordance-based perspective

213
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,979
which underscores the centrality of the

214
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,980
I can notion in shaping both cognitive

215
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,920
processes and behavioral outcomes

216
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,200
so Maxwell ramstead again substantiates

217
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,480
this perspective and resonates with the

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
research conducted by brunberg in 2018.

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,080
it posits for instance that agency is

220
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,839
far from being a mere passive State

221
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,660
rather it involves active Dynamic

222
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,100
engagement with the environment

223
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,240
current investigations in this domain

224
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,519
are being for instance continued by

225
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,640
researchers like radi pitlia who is

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,940
working on connecting properly uh the

227
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,339
the psychological phenomenon of agency

228
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,880
in uh active inference modeling

229
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,640
in parallel Tom holds you Invasion

230
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,560
models conceptualize active inference as

231
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,839
a Bayesian process aimed at minimizing

232
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,820
prediction error

233
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,160
this model finds support in the work of

234
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
Cal and comp and suggests that agency is

235
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
an active Endeavor to aligns sensory

236
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,519
inputs with internal predictions thereby

237
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,560
fostering a sense of control and

238
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,899
self-efficacy

239
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,899
the cybernetic interpretations offers a

240
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,120
more mechanistic lens focusing on

241
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,940
control mechanism in homeostasis

242
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,000
in this view agency is not just about

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,120
accurate predictions but also about

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,760
maintaining a balanced State through

245
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
Dynamic interpretations interaction

246
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,779
sorry with the environment

247
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,820
recent studies highlight the

248
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,220
significance of performance-based

249
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,620
inferences in shaping our sense of

250
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,040
agency

251
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,660
that approach suggested the congruence

252
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,399
between our actions and their expected

253
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,620
outcomes plays a pivotal role in

254
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,980
strengthening or weakening our sense of

255
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,660
agency

256
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,580
so collectively these diverse

257
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,279
interpretations serve as intellectual

258
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,620
Bridges connecting the domains of

259
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,720
philosophy Psychology and computational

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,459
Neuroscience

261
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,279
they offer complementary insights that

262
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,100
enrich our understanding of agency

263
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,660
thereby contributing to the broader

264
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,940
discourse on inactivism and its

265
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,180
application in understanding complex

266
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,319
cognitive and social phenomena

267
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,480
so how is Agents agency extended

268
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,940
deep temporal models and the concept of

269
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,940
agency both focus on the minimization of

270
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,279
uncertainty and the optimization of

271
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,959
decision making

272
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,779
deep temporal models provide a

273
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,700
computational framework that can model

274
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,519
the complex

275
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,440
time-dependent patterns of behavior and

276
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,940
cognition

277
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,700
offering insights into how an agency is

278
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,600
exercised in Dynamic social contexts

279
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
in the context of our overall goal of

280
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,560
understanding scripts through active

281
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,320
inference combining deep temporal models

282
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
with theories of agency allows us to

283
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,279
create more nuanced and predictive

284
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,820
models of how individuals navigate

285
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,040
social norms and make decisions through

286
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,680
goal-directed actions across different

287
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,260
scales of concern

288
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,500
in social cognition deep temporal models

289
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,779
help individuals anticipate and adapt to

290
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,100
changes in their social environment

291
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,860
across time skills that go beyond what

292
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,920
would be considered simply reactive

293
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,060
thereby reducing uncertainty and

294
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,018
enhancing decision making

295
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,360
an individual can plan an extend agency

296
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,600
beyond the current moment

297
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,399
so in the realm of planning algorithms

298
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,160
deep temporal models allow us for a

299
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,459
theoretical foundation for optimality

300
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,980
especially when resources are limited

301
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,019
they enable State abstraction and

302
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,899
cognitive control essential elements in

303
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,940
hierarchical planning

304
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,459
deep Temple models also constitute to

305
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,079
contribute to various cognitive

306
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,120
processes such as action understanding

307
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
and language processing which we will

308
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,000
discuss later

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,820
they can be interpreted and integrated

310
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,500
into deep reinforcement learning

311
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,019
algorithms to develop socially aware

312
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,600
navigation policies

313
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
deep temporal models thus serve as a

314
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,399
computational again bridge between the

315
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,920
neural mechanisms of action

316
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,639
understanding and the cognitive

317
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
processes that give rise to agency

318
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,240
so what might be potentially

319
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,040
neural mechanism that allows us to

320
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
connect deep temporal models to

321
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,380
um social interactions

322
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,360
this is where we bring in the insights

323
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,220
from neuroneuron systems and active

324
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,480
inference

325
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,800
this way we can have a more

326
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,839
comprehensive models that only predicts

327
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,820
but explains how individuals exercise

328
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,980
agency and complex social landscapes

329
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,139
here mirror neurons serve as a neural

330
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,420
Cornerstone for social cognition

331
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,700
firing not only during the execution of

332
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,680
an action but also during the

333
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,300
observation of that same action

334
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,639
performed by another

335
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,740
these specialized neurons are Central to

336
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,360
The Continuous updating of internal

337
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,639
models of the environment

338
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,700
including the actions and intentions of

339
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,200
others

340
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,260
they minimize uncertainty and facilitate

341
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,660
navigation through complex social

342
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,779
Landscapes allowing us for smoother

343
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,360
social interactions and more effective

344
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,639
communication

345
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,639
so here the Deep temporal models are

346
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,139
hierarchical generative models that

347
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,360
offer a computational framework

348
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,600
and these models are Adept at handling

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,420
the complexities of self-agency and

350
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,220
other agency

351
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,100
in the context of self-agency a deep

352
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,220
temporal models affords a high bias or

353
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,680
Precision to proprioceptive predictions

354
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,839
which gives us a nuanced understanding

355
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,339
of one's own actions

356
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,260
when observing another this bias is

357
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,779
adaptively suppressed enabling the

358
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,880
system to be flexible and context

359
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,360
sensitive

360
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,519
the interplay between mirror neurons and

361
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,160
deep temporal model is thus a compelling

362
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,100
area of research mirror neurons

363
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,079
contribute to the process of updating

364
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,480
internal models which is a core function

365
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,560
of uh deep temporal models

366
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,199
this synergistic relationship lasts for

367
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,899
more nuanced understanding of action

368
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,500
prediction

369
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,160
we can see a deep and significant

370
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,959
implication for long-term planning in

371
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,360
Social context The Continuous updating

372
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,240
of internal models facilitated by mirror

373
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,880
neurons and computationally powered here

374
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,980
through the Deep temporal models is

375
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,779
crucial for making complex decisions and

376
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,920
planning future social interactions

377
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,720
there's been Recent research that

378
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,160
indicates that our capacity to

379
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,980
understand actions extend beyond the

380
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,440
mirror neuron systems which involves the

381
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,959
activation of areas signaling unexpected

382
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,579
events

383
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,800
this adds another layer of complexity to

384
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,779
the already intricate interplay between

385
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,779
the neurons and the models which suggest

386
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,980
that our understanding of action

387
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,500
prediction and social cognition is far

388
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,620
from complete but is advancing rapidly

389
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,740
thanks to these integrated Frameworks

390
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,980
so given the ongoing research on mirror

391
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,079
neurons we have to consider how

392
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,820
computational models like deep temporal

393
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,500
models can offer a more nuanced

394
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,940
framework for studying these neural

395
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,480
mechanisms

396
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,620
so

397
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,959
let's try to think about

398
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,660
um some of the issues with mirror neuron

399
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,880
research

400
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,519
it's not without controversy some

401
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,680
critical reviews argue that there's no

402
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,480
compelling evidence supporting the role

403
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,500
of mirror neurons in action

404
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,120
understanding

405
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
others can suggest that mirror neurons

406
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,779
may be involved in lower level processes

407
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,000
of action perception but not in higher

408
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,980
level intention understanding

409
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,019
so we need more studies to control for

410
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,880
pre-motor contributions to action

411
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,680
perception and provide a clearer

412
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,420
definition of what is meant by action

413
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,279
understanding

414
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,019
this is particularly important as some

415
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,660
Research indicates that there may be no

416
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,759
proof that mirror neurons lead to action

417
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,160
understanding

418
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,959
this doesn't mean that it negates the

419
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,579
importance of these systems it means we

420
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,040
need more research to make sure that

421
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,780
they are in fact related to action

422
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,699
understanding

423
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,799
the functional properties of the mirror

424
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,299
neuron system indicates that action

425
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,339
understanding May primarily be based on

426
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,160
the motor cognition that under underpins

427
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,559
one's own capacity to act

428
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,480
so we will now consider how these neural

429
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,460
mechanisms can be integrated into

430
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,440
broader Frameworks like extended and

431
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,480
optimized active inference

432
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,919
so by doing so we can leverage

433
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,539
generative models to provide a more

434
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,799
nuanced understanding of action

435
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,320
perception prediction social cognition

436
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,419
and adapting behaviors to lead us to

437
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,280
scripts gender perspectives and cultural

438
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,000
affordances

439
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,100
we have expanded in time

440
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,640
now let's expand in space

441
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,860
extended and optimize active inference

442
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,539
represents a comprehensive framework

443
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,179
that Bridges between internal cognitive

444
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,700
processes and external environmental

445
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,679
interactions

446
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,080
generative models serve as the

447
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,539
Cornerstone extending beyond the

448
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,880
confines of an organism's brain and body

449
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
to incorporate external cognitive

450
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
resources such as Maps or written

451
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,299
language

452
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,460
this extension not only enhances the

453
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,440
efficiency and accuracy of these models

454
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,780
but also has practical implications in

455
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,460
various domains like social interactions

456
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,460
and language processing

457
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,640
if we think of a cognitive niche

458
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,480
um

459
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,700
the framework introduces key Dynamics

460
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,220
like selective Developmental and

461
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,620
organism Niche coordination

462
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,860
the Dynamics elucidate the intricate

463
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,080
relationship between organisms and their

464
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,240
environment

465
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,160
including the reciprocal effects of

466
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,720
environmental modifications and

467
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,000
selection pressures

468
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
in sequential Dynamics generative models

469
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,620
facilitate effective communication and

470
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,480
understanding

471
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,280
they allow us to see the emergence of

472
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,140
Behavioral and neurophysiological

473
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,299
correlates such as Theta gamma coupling

474
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,160
which we will discuss later in neural

475
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,960
activity which can be seen as an

476
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,820
emergent property of belief updating

477
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,500
under variational message passing

478
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,000
billing upon the foundational aspects of

479
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,640
extending and optimized active inference

480
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,340
it's crucial to delve into its specific

481
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,179
applications in Social contexts

482
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,620
when we optimize our generative models

483
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,240
through social scripts and Norms we can

484
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,440
see how extending active inference

485
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,240
serves as a practical tool for

486
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,940
navigating and modifying complex social

487
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Landscapes aligning with the framework's

488
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,160
broader goals of cognitive Niche

489
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,340
Construction

490
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,960
so we can see that this integrates both

491
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,700
internal and external cognitive

492
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,620
resources to optimize the generative

493
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,918
model

494
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,860
scripts serve as a cognitive blueprint

495
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,500
that reduce the uncertainty and

496
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,059
facilitates successful social

497
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,720
interactions they're continuously

498
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
updated through adapted changing social

499
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,640
Landscapes they enhance the fluidity and

500
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,880
adaptability of social behaviors

501
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,620
social norms act as a macro level

502
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,419
behavioral expectation that shapes the

503
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,539
social environment and creates favorable

504
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,539
niches for human interactions

505
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,940
these Norms are internal representations

506
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,299
that help individuals navigate complex

507
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,580
social environments effectively

508
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,120
so here cognitive Niche Construction

509
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,820
involves active modification of the

510
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,980
environment to create those favorable

511
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,200
contexts

512
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
extended active inference takes us a

513
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,980
step further by allowing for the

514
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,960
optimization of generative models

515
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,820
creating environments that are not just

516
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,299
favorable but also harmonious

517
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,940
the comprehensive approach here has

518
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,799
implications that span from psychology

519
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,799
sociology artificial intelligence and

520
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,360
allows us to potentially set the stage

521
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,039
for future research and cognitive

522
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,280
science

523
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,539
so here we see that there's an

524
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,120
importance to optimizing internal models

525
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,100
for effect to effective social

526
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,660
interactions

527
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,400
so while extended active inference

528
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,960
focuses on the broader cognitive

529
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,940
architecture involving generative models

530
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,500
and social norms

531
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,080
here we zero in on the role of deontic

532
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,900
value and social Conformity providing a

533
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,460
more nuanced understanding of how

534
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,200
individuals adapt and shape their social

535
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,299
environment

536
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,960
so the concept of deontic value

537
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,940
refers to the value attributed to

538
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,740
actions based on their adherence to

539
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,000
social norms and expectations

540
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,000
it allows us to guide individual choices

541
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,640
when faced with a decision an individual

542
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,799
way the deontic value of potential

543
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,559
actions against other factors like

544
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,380
personal preferences beliefs

545
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,299
to determine the most appropriate course

546
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,919
of action

547
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,000
he'll just allow me one

548
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,020
so this ties us very nicely to the

549
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,860
notion of agency that we explored before

550
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,100
in regimes of Expectations by axle

551
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,919
constant we elaborate the deonta cues

552
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,960
enable the environment to learn about

553
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
the behavior of its inhabitants

554
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,940
effectively Outsourcing the epistemic

555
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,980
and pragmatic values of any Behavior

556
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,860
you can see that the extension of active

557
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,539
inference here takes on a whole other

558
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,840
meaning

559
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,100
so active inference allows for dynamic

560
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,740
adaptation enables the individual to

561
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,659
update their internal models better

562
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,120
anticipate and connect to their

563
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,620
environments such that the environment

564
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,380
and the individual mutually model each

565
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,000
other

566
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,880
the optic value here serves as a Common

567
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
Thread between active inference and

568
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,460
regimes of expectations

569
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,280
through these regimes of expectation and

570
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,500
active inference we'll achieve a better

571
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,480
understanding of social Conformity and

572
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,080
decision making

573
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,140
regimes of expectations centers on the

574
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,000
computational construct of deontic value

575
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,940
which we explained before

576
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,860
and aligns with the broader research on

577
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,480
social conformity

578
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,400
especially the winner takes all model

579
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,039
proposed by Frank in 2008.

580
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,539
social expectation here plays

581
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:37,919
significant role in shaping human

582
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,620
decisions and specifically social

583
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,260
Conformity act as a learning strategy

584
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,299
which is effective in on certain

585
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,039
environments

586
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,380
so now that we build on the foundational

587
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,960
role of deontic value in the regimes of

588
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,700
expectation

589
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,260
we find that this computational

590
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,419
construct also serve as a crucial

591
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,220
weighing factor in individual decision

592
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,520
making

593
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,380
so we'll see how we can put this effect

594
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,760
directly on decision making

595
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,460
regimes of

596
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,020
um sorry regimes of expectations have

597
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,940
basically a function of Fitness

598
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,640
enhancing social conformity

599
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,380
it suggests that conforming to social

600
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,860
norms has evolutionary advantages

601
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,559
it leads into a circular causality

602
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,260
between shared Bayesian expectations and

603
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,080
individual policy selection

604
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
it's consistent with findings by sanfin

605
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,659
2014 which emphasized the importance of

606
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,460
norms and expectations in Social

607
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,179
decision making

608
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,280
so now that we have

609
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,140
how the environment and the individual

610
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,480
co-construct through these regimes of

611
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,020
expectations

612
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,280
we will find how this allows us to

613
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,679
construct a sense of self

614
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,220
specifically the social self

615
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,640
here social norms and shared Bayesian

616
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,860
expectations link our individual and

617
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,600
collective decision making processes to

618
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,520
the broader understanding of selfhood

619
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,580
so how does active inference allow us to

620
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,820
model how we derive the sense of self

621
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,279
let's start by explaining the three main

622
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,039
types of cells minimal

623
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,460
narrative and social

624
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,360
the minimal self is the pre-reflexive

625
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,940
experience of being a subject

626
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,679
emphasizing the body's role in shaping

627
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,679
subjective experience

628
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,740
The Narrative self is shaped by personal

629
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,799
stories and experiences highlighting the

630
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,360
importance of generative models in

631
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,600
organizing these experiences

632
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,179
aligns with the active inference

633
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,340
formalism and psychological desires

634
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,100
providing a coherent narrative that

635
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,799
guides our sense of self across time

636
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,500
so social self emerges from interactions

637
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,840
with others and is influenced by social

638
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,500
norms values and shared generative

639
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,159
models

640
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,200
this concept is supported by the full

641
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,840
concept of intentionality which includes

642
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,500
desires beliefs intentions awareness and

643
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,779
skill

644
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,580
understanding these facets of the sense

645
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,140
of self through the lens of active

646
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,500
inference gives us an integrative

647
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,600
cognitive process for emotions and

648
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,179
social interactions

649
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,740
so now we'll delve more into the

650
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,900
intricacies of the social self

651
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,580
to show that the generative model and

652
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,740
social scripts discussed earlier are

653
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,840
integral to its formation

654
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,120
these scripts optimized through extended

655
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,679
active inference not only guide our

656
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,240
social interaction but also contribute

657
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,360
to the shaping of that self

658
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,980
creating a seamless interplay between

659
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,960
individual cognition and Collective

660
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,860
social behavior

661
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,299
so as we said earlier social scripts are

662
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,159
the cognitive blueprints that guide

663
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,039
individuals through a myriad of expected

664
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,279
actions or events in Social contexts

665
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
these scripts are essentially generative

666
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,480
models that help individuals predict and

667
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,179
navigate social interactions

668
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,220
they're indispensable they allow us to

669
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,200
continuously update our internal models

670
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,779
to minimize uncertainty and achieve a

671
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,299
stable internal States

672
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,100
it's particularly important in a world

673
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,600
where social interactions are

674
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,120
increasingly complex and Laden with

675
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,379
unspoken expectations

676
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,380
this optimization serves as a micro

677
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,659
level mechanism that complements the

678
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,580
macro level influence of social norms

679
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,460
and deontic values creating a cohesive

680
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,960
understanding of social behavior

681
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,820
social scripts can be enshrined in

682
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,039
Beyond to cues which enable the

683
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,960
environment to learn about the behavior

684
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,760
of its inhabitants effectively

685
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,279
Outsourcing the epistemic and pragmatic

686
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,200
values of any Behavior as we saw earlier

687
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,320
in cognitive Niche Construction

688
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,380
the context the concept of contextual

689
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,480
modulation integrates sensory and motor

690
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,940
cues to influence our actions and

691
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,919
decisions allowing for dynamic

692
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,559
adaptation and refinement of generative

693
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,039
models

694
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,400
through this modulation we can see how

695
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,500
social scripts and norms

696
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
are shaped and adapted over time

697
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,600
which promotes the adaptability in the

698
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,460
face of changing environments of

699
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,500
individuals embedded in that environment

700
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,140
now

701
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,080
contextual modulation here is pretty

702
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,360
important and the mechanism not only

703
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,400
refines our generative model but also

704
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,460
provides the Adaptive flexibility

705
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,740
required in complex environments which

706
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,720
unites the theoretical underpinnings of

707
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,460
active inference with empirical findings

708
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,539
and adaptive Behavior

709
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,360
so according to Francesco donaroma

710
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,520
action perception is an active

711
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,740
inferential process that combines motor

712
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,320
prediction and hypothesis testing

713
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,740
crucial for understanding social scripts

714
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,899
adaptive social behavior thus results

715
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,840
from the dynamic interplay of

716
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,340
socio-effective and socio-cognitive

717
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,260
processes

718
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,860
research by Berg Mirza provides proof of

719
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,500
concept that social context May alter

720
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,200
perception enabling more adaptive

721
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,299
Behavior

722
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,980
it's also supported by studies that

723
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,679
reveal how instinctive Behavior

724
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,080
circuits in hypothalamus dynamically

725
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,240
encodes spatial and sensory cues to

726
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,919
drive adaptive social behaviors

727
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,539
contextual modulation and social scripts

728
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,000
are integral to Adaptive behavior and

729
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,320
action perception

730
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,480
which allows us to show how social

731
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,419
interactions are crafted through these

732
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,700
different scale these deep temporal

733
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,520
models that integrate various kinds of

734
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,919
priors at different scales

735
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,919
so here contextual modulation acts as a

736
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,600
linchpin in the integration of social

737
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,820
scripts into the generative models

738
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,140
we can now appreciate how generative

739
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,299
model and social scripts coalesce to

740
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,520
form a comprehensive framework for

741
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,020
understanding interactions

742
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,120
so active inference is a nuanced lens to

743
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,860
explore how

744
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,620
power dynamics

745
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,700
shape share degenerative models

746
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,860
thereby influencing the cultural

747
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,620
affordances available to individuals

748
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,779
for instance epistemic communities

749
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,940
serves as platforms where power dynamics

750
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,299
can significantly shape shared beliefs

751
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,919
and actions

752
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,080
through the construction of certain

753
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,399
niche

754
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,340
we can see that existing power structure

755
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,159
lead to the creation of environments

756
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,860
that perpetuate these structures through

757
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,899
certain kinds of scripts certain kinds

758
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,179
of norms and through the valence that we

759
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,700
associate to our sense of self relative

760
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,399
to these Scripts

761
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
cultural affordances here are

762
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,419
dynamically influenced by power tinged

763
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,679
asymmetries

764
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,179
these asymmetries can affect how

765
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,580
individuals perceive and enact social

766
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,659
scripts

767
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,700
which further shapes the cultural

768
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,440
affordances that they encounter

769
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,740
we see how deeply intertwined cultural

770
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,640
affordances are with power dynamics

771
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,240
it allows us to understand

772
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,779
societal structures in more depth

773
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:58,860
so

774
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,480
when we expand the scope of active

775
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,919
inference and cultural affordance

776
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,159
negotiation we can dive into a case

777
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,440
study that of gender norms and gender

778
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,640
fluidity to broader cultural contexts

779
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,279
this exemplifies the influence of power

780
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,820
dynamics

781
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,779
so just as individuals navigate and

782
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,700
adapt to cultural affordances that are

783
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,020
deeply shaped by societal power

784
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,179
structures they have to navigate gender

785
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,100
related affordances that they also

786
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,580
engage with

787
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,760
so through this we can also understand

788
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,659
the concept of gender fluidity

789
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:38,399
here generative model plays specific

790
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,980
role which is to adapt to changing

791
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,860
societal norms and gender related

792
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,820
affordances these are cultural

793
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,159
performances

794
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,140
is dynamic from a niche construction

795
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,260
allows individuals to create and adapt

796
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,120
environments that reflect their evolving

797
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,500
gender identity and expression

798
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,539
the concept of affordance negotiation is

799
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,640
particularly relevant here

800
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,320
it refers to the process by which

801
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,039
individuals adapt their behavior to

802
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,140
maximize opportunities and minimize

803
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,500
challenges in their environment

804
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,360
in the context of gender fluidity it

805
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,039
involves navigating complex social

806
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,320
scripts and Norms that shape gender

807
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,860
expression

808
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,940
research suggests that these gender

809
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,919
differences in negotiation are

810
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,380
contextually bound and can be subject to

811
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,059
change

812
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,740
by understanding how individuals

813
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,840
navigate these social scripts and Norms

814
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,279
we can for instance address the

815
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,799
limitations or constraints that affects

816
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,320
expressions of their gender identity

817
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,279
so here gender through the lens of

818
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,320
active inference as a case study and

819
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,080
affordance negotiation gives us a

820
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,140
comprehensive view of the social

821
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,080
psychology and how it can apply to

822
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,700
gender studies for instance but this is

823
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,380
true for many other kinds of cultural

824
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,980
phenomena

825
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,779
so we build now on the understanding of

826
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,519
how active inference and power dynamics

827
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,840
shape cultural affordances

828
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,000
we can see how this allows us to

829
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,560
understand potentially puzzling actions

830
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,599
um which are shaped by social scripts

831
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,699
and the Dynamics within the epistemic

832
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,619
communities they inhabit so

833
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,139
we have defined how scripts allow us to

834
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,139
interpret different kinds of behaviors

835
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,560
and help people navigate these their

836
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,540
desired outcomes given these social

837
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,760
scripts

838
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,159
so what happens when we are faced

839
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,619
um with puzzling actions

840
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,359
people rely on their generative models

841
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,879
to update their beliefs and expectations

842
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,099
so do we interpret these behaviors based

843
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,839
on inherent traits or situational

844
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,359
reasons

845
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,179
here traits and motives interact with in

846
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,280
predicting behaviors channeling the

847
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,020
behavioral expression throne's life

848
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,300
throughout one's life on the other hand

849
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,520
contextual cues significantly influence

850
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,839
the interpretation of ambiguous

851
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,099
behaviors

852
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,260
social scripts guide our expectation in

853
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,320
social situations can either be adapted

854
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,359
when confronted with unexpected Behavior

855
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:15,480
or allow us to shift from script to

856
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,820
script to have a better prior over what

857
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,780
we might expect next

858
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,680
so for instance this challenge is

859
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,240
particularly pronounced for those who

860
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,099
diverge from established social norms

861
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,619
and script their interpretations are

862
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,060
influenced by the Dynamics of

863
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,500
information spread within their

864
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,839
epistemic communities

865
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,000
understanding ambiguous social behaviors

866
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,040
is not just about individual cognition

867
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,260
but also about the social and cultural

868
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,880
contexts that shape our interpretations

869
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,520
so now we're going to dive from this

870
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,440
point into the specific contextual

871
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,599
factors that further Nuance our

872
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,520
understanding

873
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,500
our former discussion emphasized the

874
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,900
influence of power and social norms and

875
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,160
now we're going to turn our attention to

876
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,800
the impact say of social anxiety

877
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,420
behavioral flexibility and goal-oriented

878
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,040
perception in shaping our

879
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,660
interpretations of social behavior

880
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,280
understanding social behaviors often

881
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,440
requires an approach that goes beyond

882
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,140
trait-based interpretations

883
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,240
contextual factors like social anxiety

884
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,460
and significantly influence how we

885
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,579
interpret an ambiguous social cue for

886
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,980
instance determining uh the most likely

887
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,320
prior using the most likely prior rather

888
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,820
than being open to other kinds of

889
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,040
interpretations

890
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,839
behavioral flexibility is another

891
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,300
crucial aspect to consider

892
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,880
it allows for adaptability and nuanced

893
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,859
understanding of social behaviors across

894
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,200
different social contexts such that a

895
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,820
different script A same script can be

896
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,200
interpreted different ways through

897
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,960
different kinds of behaviors

898
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,359
the concept of goals here plays an

899
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,400
important role in Social perception

900
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,280
they can serve to provide a broad

901
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,640
implication or where for where we

902
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,260
understand an individual to try to be

903
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,599
headed such that while their lower level

904
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,400
script may be different from the one we

905
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,079
have their higher level script is still

906
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,740
interpretable

907
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,240
so now we're going to try to see what

908
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,760
can be the outcomes in real life of all

909
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
these processes together

910
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,020
we're going to focus on cognitive

911
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,760
mechanisms that underpin social

912
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
phenomena like confirmation bias and

913
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,540
Echo Chambers

914
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,640
building on the concept of active

915
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,040
inference we explore how individuals not

916
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,140
only interpret ambiguous social cues but

917
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,940
also actively seek information that

918
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,980
confirm their pre-existing belief

919
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,680
thereby shaping epistemic communities

920
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,760
confirmation bias is a cognitive

921
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,920
tendency that affects information spread

922
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,839
and decision making

923
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,240
it is driven by agents seeking

924
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,859
information that confirms their

925
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,140
pre-existing belief while avoiding

926
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,300
challenging information

927
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,880
this is an effective way of using action

928
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,099
to minimize free energy rather than

929
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,940
updating beliefs in a costly manner

930
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,300
Echo Chambers amplify this bias by

931
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,640
creating self-reinforcing Loops where

932
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,560
individuals selectively expose

933
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,500
themselves to aligned information

934
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,240
so Research indicates that Network

935
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,220
structures contribute to the Persistence

936
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,440
of echo Chambers thereby affecting

937
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,740
policy making and public discourse

938
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,180
the minimization of free energy

939
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,060
transfers to the network thereby shaping

940
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,400
the environment

941
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,040
you can see here how there is a loop

942
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,540
where the environment both shapes the

943
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,400
individual who will in turn continuously

944
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,680
shave the environment

945
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,780
interestingly some Studies have

946
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,599
identified a reverse confirmation bias

947
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,060
whereby some people actually do seek out

948
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,000
information in an explorative manner

949
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,359
which again aligns with this idea of

950
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,540
um of active inference epistemic value

951
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,020
and here we may try to ponder why

952
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,579
certain people are more likely to break

953
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,220
out of their Echo Chambers rather than

954
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,220
uh stay in them this may align

955
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,740
potentially with deep temporal models

956
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,859
whereas we can see value at a low at um

957
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,140
at a

958
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,240
later point in time and perhaps focus

959
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,359
more on this expected value rather than

960
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,060
on the direct value of the confirmation

961
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,540
bias

962
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,460
to mitigate such biases we can use

963
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,579
strategies such as fostering epistemic

964
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,339
change through diverging information and

965
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,460
encouraging reflection

966
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,900
to break apart Echo Chambers

967
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,980
and now we've explored a little bit

968
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,920
confirmation bias and Echo chamber

969
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,960
we can see how this in

970
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,380
um extends to human communication

971
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,900
this allows us to explore the principles

972
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,880
of active inference which shape

973
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,099
individual cognitive Tendencies and the

974
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,320
influence of the broader dynamics of

975
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
communication and collective

976
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,900
intelligence on the environment

977
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,240
so we can link communicative Behavior to

978
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,640
biological imperative of minimizing free

979
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,740
energy which emphasizes the

980
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,800
action-oriented nature of communication

981
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,540
the framework allows for adaptive

982
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,420
Behavior even when the models deviate

983
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,880
from theoretical representations of the

984
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,020
environment

985
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,400
so

986
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,700
how do we justify that people lie or

987
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,980
that people

988
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,420
say things which don't seem to rely

989
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,940
properly with what everybody else seems

990
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,200
to believe about the environment

991
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,720
effectively this is an action you're

992
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,880
trying to push a belief onto the

993
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
environment such that there is a

994
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,240
potential for the environment to be

995
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,280
shaped in a way that evidences your

996
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,700
beliefs

997
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,920
so we can think of cognitive control

998
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,900
here

999
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,859
whereby active inference has an

1000
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,420
effective goal maintenance in working

1001
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,780
memory it provides top-down guidance for

1002
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,839
overt Behavior moving beyond stereotyped

1003
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,000
responses our understanding of

1004
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,460
communication is enriched by introducing

1005
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,960
neurobiologically plausible

1006
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,540
computational hypotheses

1007
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,400
the ecological approach to active

1008
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,640
inference is a framework that

1009
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,099
understand the complexities of human

1010
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,339
communication across different scales it

1011
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,260
explores how individuals contribute to

1012
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,880
the collective intelligence of a group

1013
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,280
or Society by fostering a collaborative

1014
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,040
approach that leverages diverse skills

1015
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,380
and knowledge

1016
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,839
this is one of the reasons Echo Chambers

1017
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,420
are maintained they're efficient in the

1018
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,339
transmission of information and promote

1019
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:47,040
collaboration among agents who overtly

1020
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,700
share a model

1021
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,579
so now we're going to look at a more

1022
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,280
detailed understanding of ecological

1023
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,500
dimensions of this discourse

1024
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,660
context as we saw earlier plays a

1025
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,300
crucial role role in the activation of

1026
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,760
predictive inferences which offers

1027
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,500
further support for ecological

1028
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,579
approaches

1029
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,400
active inference models contain terms

1030
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,440
that encode both the object of desire

1031
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,359
and the strength of Desire of the

1032
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,460
psychological level

1033
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,619
so the context of inactive inference

1034
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,359
suggests that generative and recognition

1035
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,940
models are best cast as realizing

1036
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,380
inferencing control under the free

1037
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,079
energy principle

1038
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,540
so in this way communication through the

1039
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,820
active inference lens gives us an

1040
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,000
action-oriented nature of Cooperative

1041
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,040
communication where together we mutually

1042
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,160
craft our models such that we can

1043
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,060
achieve a common goal

1044
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,040
so now and lastly

1045
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,460
let's dive into a very short overview of

1046
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,320
how this may translate to language

1047
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,839
processing

1048
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,760
so remember we discussed deep temporal

1049
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,260
models

1050
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,420
here they enable us to explore the

1051
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,640
sequential dynamics of language

1052
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,319
processing

1053
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,359
the models are hierarchical

1054
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,880
where inference at higher levels informs

1055
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,880
the selection of words at lower levels

1056
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,640
this hierarchical structure allows for

1057
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,339
the accumulation of evidence over nested

1058
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:21,780
time scales

1059
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,000
one key aspect is the emergence of

1060
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,160
Behavioral and neurophysiological

1061
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,619
correlates in those sequential Dynamics

1062
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,140
like the Theta gamma couplings that we

1063
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,260
discussed earlier it's a phenomenon that

1064
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,540
again was observed and allows us to

1065
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,859
measure belief updating under

1066
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,920
variational message passing

1067
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,380
thus generative models aren't just

1068
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,660
predictive but also explanatory they can

1069
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,400
help us understand neural mechanisms

1070
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,900
like language comprehension

1071
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,420
so in cognitive control linguistine can

1072
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,920
be cast as individual agents

1073
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
contributing to this intelligence of the

1074
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,160
group

1075
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,500
and the research shows that genitive

1076
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,599
models are Central to the perception and

1077
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,720
interpretation of the linguistic signals

1078
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,880
we have a structural understanding of

1079
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,700
sequences of words and their context

1080
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,680
sensitivity

1081
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,359
this enables the agent to resolve

1082
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,520
uncertainty about the underlying

1083
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,839
conceptual semantic or lexical causes of

1084
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,680
sensory input

1085
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,880
it can incorporate beliefs about

1086
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,579
narratives the type of question the

1087
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,859
scenic state of the world a semiotic

1088
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:36,359
Factor indicating the topic of

1089
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,280
discussion

1090
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,859
these factors generate expectations for

1091
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:42,839
the lower levels such as syntax and

1092
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,180
semantics

1093
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,300
models enable inference through this

1094
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,819
deep structure about the narrative as

1095
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:54,440
such as those seen in Reading

1096
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,980
here the neural processes can be

1097
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,140
understood in terms of simulating the

1098
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,540
epistemic foraging seen in reading and

1099
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,980
other language related activities

1100
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,740
so to conclude

1101
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,680
we have seen a comprehensive

1102
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,359
understanding of active inference

1103
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,119
inactivism and their interplay in

1104
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,119
shaping social cognition Behavior

1105
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,400
we have explored various philosophical

1106
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,020
perspectives such as the inactive

1107
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,880
affordance-based perspective The

1108
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,280
helmholts Invasion model and highlighted

1109
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,440
the contribution to understanding our

1110
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,119
social interactions

1111
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,240
we've explored deep temporal models as a

1112
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,040
potent computational tool for modeling

1113
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,140
complex time-dependent patterns in

1114
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,060
social cognition such as in language as

1115
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,020
well

1116
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,300
we've discussed the role of mirror

1117
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,700
neurons emphasizing their potential

1118
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,500
sensuality in continuously updating

1119
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,359
internal models of the environment and

1120
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,980
their significance in social cognition

1121
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,160
discuss potential future directions for

1122
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,020
research if you are interested in these

1123
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,300
topics

1124
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,160
so here the interplay between active

1125
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,079
inference and activism computational

1126
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,960
models like deep temporal models give us

1127
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,640
a multi-dimensional view of social

1128
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,160
cognition and agency

1129
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,319
it broadens the scope of research but

1130
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,960
also brings us closer to our goal of

1131
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,420
understanding the complex cognitive and

1132
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,200
social phenomena

1133
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,260
so for next class I offer you an

1134
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,480
opportunity

1135
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,480
you should pick a text

1136
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,700
from this session from the references

1137
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,400
that will be made available or one that

1138
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,980
you find yourself in the literature

1139
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,420
read it

1140
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,599
and try to explain how it ties to the

1141
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,060
concepts that we explored today

1142
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,480
ideally you can present it to the group

1143
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,280
take five minutes explain what the text

1144
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,260
says and how it content and connects to

1145
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,300
the contents of the course

1146
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,579
if you have any questions we can

1147
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:02,780
potentially take them out

1148
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,220
thank you Mao that was epic

1149
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,560
all right well people can write

1150
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,480
questions in the chat I'll just read one

1151
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,800
all right

1152
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,099
where does identity and ideology fit

1153
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,859
in my presentation or in the in the

1154
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:31,260
framework that I'm presenting

1155
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,640
so I'm gonna assume it's in the

1156
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,319
framework

1157
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,220
um

1158
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,619
identity fits as a social self right

1159
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:40,020
identity is literally

1160
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,660
um how you craft your selfhood relative

1161
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,480
to the narratives that you're given so

1162
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,400
it's it's it's precisely the social self

1163
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,760
that we discussed ideology corresponds

1164
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,079
to

1165
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,180
um a loser

1166
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,800
let's say weak script that allows you to

1167
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,200
shift the valence of certain values

1168
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,140
across certain Norms so

1169
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,460
let's assume that you understand values

1170
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,280
as a higher or lower probability for a

1171
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,819
type of

1172
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,619
high-level Behavior so I value kindness

1173
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:20,520
there'll be a high prior over kindness

1174
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,000
and therefore the paths the policies

1175
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,180
that leads to what I ascribe to as

1176
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,760
kindness will therefore become more

1177
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,680
likely to be adopted and will become a

1178
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,859
norm if more of us value the same thing

1179
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,920
the key issue here is how do I associate

1180
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,160
the semantics of kindness to the actual

1181
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,920
pragmatic representations and actions

1182
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,720
that correspond to what I believe to be

1183
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,160
kindness and this is where the

1184
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,500
co-construction happens right we

1185
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,720
communicate together and I'm going to

1186
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,960
say this is kindness I'm acting on the

1187
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,480
World to determine now this is what we

1188
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,220
will believe to be kindness and I value

1189
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,319
kindness very highly because that's my

1190
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,660
ideology and therefore this is what we

1191
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,579
should be doing all these things connect

1192
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,680
together through the interaction of the

1193
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,140
environment the symbols encrusted in the

1194
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,760
environment that I share and

1195
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,380
co-construct through communication

1196
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,780
wow and

1197
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,060
how does that have an impact on

1198
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,460
affordances was the follow-up question

1199
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,700
there

1200
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,319
so if we go back to the part on the

1201
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,300
course about affordances we saw that

1202
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,560
certain

1203
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,660
um certain things are made more likely

1204
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,839
given the niche that you are in

1205
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,000
um if you understand neon to cues you

1206
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,819
see that um there's going to be some

1207
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,460
signals that pull you as attractors in a

1208
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,960
specific Direction

1209
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,940
so let's assume that we have an ideology

1210
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,420
again that promotes kindness in the

1211
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,300
environment it is highly likely that

1212
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,119
potential Pathways towards kindness will

1213
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,700
be made more available

1214
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,200
so for instance

1215
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,880
um let's assume that we believe that

1216
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,339
giving money to people

1217
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,099
um is kindness there's going to be more

1218
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:13,920
initiatives for you to give money so for

1219
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,880
instance I don't know if you guys have

1220
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,220
taken the plane recently but

1221
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,780
um Air Canada

1222
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,460
has started

1223
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,720
um

1224
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,599
program where if you have loose change

1225
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,640
in your pockets you can put it in the in

1226
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,500
the seat in front of you in a little

1227
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,660
pocket thing and you put the money there

1228
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,760
and they're going to donate it now

1229
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,680
I'm not saying that's kindness we can

1230
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,839
argue about the politics of it all and

1231
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,460
the tax Etc

1232
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,980
but this is an affordance that wasn't

1233
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,420
there before

1234
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,819
and now it's in my environment now I

1235
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:47,220
don't have to take it but it's it's now

1236
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,319
more readily available for me to

1237
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,359
actually act on it and you can see this

1238
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,700
across every level it's just that most

1239
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,819
affordances are invisible to us as

1240
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,520
affordances we just react to them we

1241
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,319
just exist within them but we don't

1242
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,599
consider they wouldn't be there such as

1243
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,420
a bathroom in a house this is one of the

1244
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,680
things that allows us to think more

1245
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,240
critically about

1246
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,339
um what it means to be homeless

1247
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,440
like to you it seems obvious when you

1248
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,640
need to go to the bathroom you'll go to

1249
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,720
the bathroom right there's a bathroom

1250
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,480
available to you but there isn't one for

1251
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,460
people who live outside because they

1252
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,079
don't have a home and yet we've

1253
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,720
criminalized the act of relieving

1254
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,200
yourself outside so we've basically said

1255
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,780
well don't pee or if you pee well you're

1256
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,599
now a criminal so being homeless by

1257
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,760
virtue of not having access to the same

1258
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,920
affordances means it's effectively

1259
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,079
criminal to be homeless so these are the

1260
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,940
kinds of ways that

1261
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,819
um ideology shapes our affordances and

1262
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:47,220
effectively pulls us in a state of

1263
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,380
Attraction and effectively in in

1264
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,880
different states of power as well

1265
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,760
because we collectively have decided

1266
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,700
that the only people who get to have the

1267
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,099
the right to certain affordances are the

1268
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,599
people who have enough money to live in

1269
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,160
a house Etc et cetera et cetera

1270
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,319
thanks there's a lot there all right

1271
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:08,760
I'll read a comment this is something

1272
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,520
you could address right now or save it

1273
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,020
for the discussion or however you want

1274
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,819
Michael wrote

1275
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,940
would you be open to attempting to map a

1276
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,280
social or personal narrative rather than

1277
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,680
another element in the literature EG

1278
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,480
translating the hero's journey or

1279
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,180
12-step recovery

1280
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,319
I'm not sure I'm sure I understand

1281
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,640
attempting to map like like like like

1282
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,339
connect the octave ontology and

1283
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:39,780
formalisms to a more broadly understood

1284
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,480
narrative or specific script

1285
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,720
so

1286
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,500
but

1287
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,500
um why do we want say

1288
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
um

1289
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,819
why do we feel like the hero's journey

1290
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,400
in itself is valuable we feel that it's

1291
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,800
valuable because we feel that

1292
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,420
it is a very easy explanation for uh why

1293
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,420
somebody would have value and it is

1294
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,339
usually

1295
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,740
um easy to minimize free energy through

1296
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,260
well there's a clear path right this

1297
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,059
person wasn't the result of very complex

1298
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:25,500
interactions of the environment or

1299
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,540
whatever it's actually no no it's all

1300
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,720
him he just understood the he understood

1301
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,579
what he had to do he figured out what he

1302
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,319
had to do and there you go he was able

1303
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,940
to do it and so this

1304
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,119
is a signal for perfect

1305
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:39,839
um

1306
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,420
Fitness to the landscape right it's Cog

1307
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,119
it's it's it's perfect cognitive grip so

1308
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,200
it's like

1309
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,900
there's an underlying assumption that

1310
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,380
this one person was able to update their

1311
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,440
genital degenerative model sufficiently

1312
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,800
such that they were perfectly able to

1313
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,660
grab every affordance that the

1314
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,540
environment gave them to go towards

1315
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,359
their uh their state objective so in

1316
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:07,680
terms of active inference it's pretty

1317
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,000
simple it's someone that has the

1318
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,400
capacity to go from a very unfit

1319
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,680
generative model to a very fits

1320
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,180
generative model relative to the

1321
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,040
environment and so we like that

1322
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,660
narrative because it's like okay well

1323
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,220
then that means everybody can do it

1324
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,619
right if if we can go from

1325
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:28,020
failure to being a hero and all we have

1326
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,500
to do is take one or two hardships and

1327
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,240
go through it

1328
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,760
um then then it's possible now there's

1329
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,559
also some deification here right because

1330
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,319
usually the hero's journey goes through

1331
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,720
some very very difficult elements and

1332
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,059
comes out on the other side

1333
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:47,940
um and we assume that because they can

1334
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,520
there's a rationale of meritocracy which

1335
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,599
is

1336
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,059
um the world is

1337
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,280
relatively equal for everybody so it

1338
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,440
tries to pull away from every other

1339
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,920
power factor ecological factor and it's

1340
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,500
like no no it's all about how you're

1341
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,599
able to to fix your generative model to

1342
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,819
do the right things that you have to do

1343
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,099
um so that's why I'm not a fan of it but

1344
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,319
I hope was this the mapping you were

1345
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:15,599
looking for in terms of active inference

1346
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,400
and um

1347
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,319
branded immunization kind of thing

1348
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,720
here's one thought on that the hero's

1349
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,160
journey or

1350
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,400
another archetypal attractor just

1351
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,040
archetype or just

1352
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,980
a thread that way it embeds a concise

1353
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,660
narrative account

1354
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,880
that is is made legible through

1355
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,319
storytelling that we can understand and

1356
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,599
it embodies not just kind of mythical

1357
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,339
things but also like

1358
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:50,460
real structural

1359
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,020
implicit

1360
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,940
features that's why some stories can be

1361
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,280
so short and and so transferable across

1362
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,140
context because they

1363
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,540
abstract but also they it's what they do

1364
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,880
include in those cases and then you

1365
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,980
talked about how that conveys something

1366
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,599
about value

1367
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,859
which is what supports social norms and

1368
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,380
social values which of course you can't

1369
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,680
point at anywhere

1370
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,540
yet

1371
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,180
what can you say about what our social

1372
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,419
norms or forces or what is the social

1373
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,780
um what is the social

1374
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,559
um

1375
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,900
I think you can point to it I think you

1376
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,200
can effectively point to processes you

1377
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,660
can point to

1378
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,359
material realities institutions

1379
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:49,800
um

1380
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,579
I think we tend to

1381
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:57,680
use the notion of the social to

1382
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,200
contrast it with the notion of the

1383
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,359
individual it's just that nothing's ever

1384
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,099
that simple

1385
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,200
um the individual is

1386
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,160
always built because of other

1387
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,400
individuals so there's there's no really

1388
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,319
such thing as an individual you're

1389
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,420
always embedded within something so the

1390
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,280
the real question is

1391
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,440
what's the scale

1392
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,700
um that you're interested in and what is

1393
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,980
identifiable as what may be within or

1394
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,480
without or outside of your control

1395
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,960
within that scale and we generally

1396
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,740
make a sort of conflation between what

1397
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,540
is social and what is uncontrollable

1398
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,760
even that's not necessarily true as we

1399
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,400
saw right because we we through our

1400
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,700
actions which can be verbal which can be

1401
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:53,099
um physical like we reiterate or

1402
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,240
push on what constitutes what is valued

1403
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,579
by other actors within the same locality

1404
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,020
so

1405
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,300
um if you're asking uh what constitutes

1406
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,559
culture

1407
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,880
well at the level of my house culture is

1408
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,240
uh we go to bed around 10 to 11 because

1409
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,640
if you don't go to bed at 11 you're

1410
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,839
gonna make noise and you're gonna wake

1411
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,319
me up so our shared culture is this this

1412
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:20,940
is something that we repeat over time

1413
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,160
that constitutes an attractor for more

1414
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,780
than just me

1415
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,059
um if I look at the level of my building

1416
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:31,200
it's nobody puts plants outside on their

1417
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,140
balcony if it's at the level of Montreal

1418
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,359
um it's there's potholes everywhere and

1419
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:37,920
we're not bitching really about it we've

1420
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,299
all accepted there's potholes everywhere

1421
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:40,980
so it's part of our culture it becomes

1422
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,720
part of our conscious

1423
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,119
um and so why is it cultural it's

1424
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,220
because

1425
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,700
we can see that this

1426
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,440
behavior these expectations translate

1427
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,500
not just to you to your own model but it

1428
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,819
translates to the model of other people

1429
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:59,040
as well and they can expect the same for

1430
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,619
you it's something which is uh

1431
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:03,240
definitely shared so I think you can

1432
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,180
easily point to things once you define

1433
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,859
the scale at which it becomes manifest

1434
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,980
thanks really interesting all right a

1435
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,920
question from upcycle Club who wrote

1436
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,859
in terms of the philosophical dimensions

1437
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:22,619
of agency and active inference

1438
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:27,180
what is the role of self-referentiality

1439
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,079
the term but if I understand correctly

1440
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:31,760
um

1441
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,520
we saw that you have to both model

1442
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,220
yourself and model the rest of the world

1443
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,359
in order to understand whether your your

1444
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:45,420
actions are likely to have the effects

1445
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,260
you want to have on the world so this

1446
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,920
self-referentiality if I understand

1447
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,500
correctly but I could be wrong is this

1448
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,660
notion of accurately modeling yourself

1449
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,540
as well does that does that answer the

1450
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,920
question

1451
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,180
yeah all right a question from

1452
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,859
Michael who wrote

1453
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:07,559
I work with marginalized communities who

1454
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:09,480
experience the larger culture as

1455
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,500
dominant

1456
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,920
and scientifically enabled how should

1457
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,500
such communities fortify themselves

1458
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,920
against the more skillful extractive

1459
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,400
cultures

1460
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,099
um I mean that's the

1461
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,920
that's the main question that's been for

1462
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,740
counter cultures forever

1463
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,799
um

1464
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,760
it depends what you mean by fortify

1465
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,680
yourself

1466
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,559
um if you mean be less likely to be

1467
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,200
extracted from

1468
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,599
um I think the question is being

1469
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,579
extracted from without getting something

1470
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:50,940
in return because effectively as you saw

1471
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,240
for coordination to happen you must

1472
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,000
provide something for the group in order

1473
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,180
for the group to move further so it's

1474
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,339
always a little bit extractive you will

1475
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:04,680
always expand some degree of free energy

1476
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,319
in order to move towards the policy that

1477
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:09,299
you've chosen as a group so there's two

1478
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:12,180
elements here chosen as a group

1479
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,819
and there should be a return on that as

1480
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:17,339
well right it shouldn't be just you pay

1481
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,500
nobody else gives you something so it's

1482
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,200
the degree to which the system minimizes

1483
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,960
everybody's free energy rather than

1484
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,540
minimizes this groups and this group is

1485
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,720
still a high brand or Gene low

1486
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,180
allostatic high allostatic load Etc

1487
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,780
so what you I mean I'm not the expert on

1488
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,220
that specifically I'm sure there are

1489
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,839
people who have worked with marginalized

1490
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,700
group way more than I have to give you

1491
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,339
better insights but

1492
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,460
from what I've read and from if I can

1493
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,960
derive from the theory that we've

1494
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,500
presented today it's

1495
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,799
you need to have a strong narrative

1496
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,780
that supports

1497
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,839
Your Capacity to increase your Fitness

1498
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:02,220
landscape

1499
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,280
and increases and maintains the bonds

1500
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,380
the the mark of blanket around your

1501
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,940
group

1502
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,160
um if your group is likely to dissolve

1503
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,740
all the time if it's constantly

1504
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,780
um

1505
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,720
threatened and shaky it's not going to

1506
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,700
be able to go very far it's always going

1507
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,680
to be in protective mode

1508
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,040
so you need to ensure that the group has

1509
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,619
strong bonds that the group can expand

1510
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,880
and that the group can together

1511
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,859
enacts policies that lead it to

1512
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:38,339
minimizing free energy and relative to

1513
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:41,339
the larger group

1514
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:44,339
that generally entails having more and

1515
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:47,880
more connections with individuals from

1516
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,760
the larger group such that

1517
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,260
um

1518
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,980
you are capable of

1519
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,099
changing their model little by little

1520
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:01,559
you want to have a strong boundary but

1521
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:03,720
you don't want to be unable to

1522
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,400
communicate with the external group

1523
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,540
because if you do that you can't

1524
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:12,059
communicate and co-construct

1525
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:13,740
um so it's

1526
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,680
it seems trivial but it's developing

1527
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,839
Ally ships where you have people from

1528
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:21,540
the larger group that become people that

1529
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,760
adopt your message and allow the

1530
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,220
expansion of your group and the ideology

1531
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,260
or the generative model of your group to

1532
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,599
be integrated within what what

1533
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,400
determines the policies of the higher

1534
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,020
level group or at least of the dominant

1535
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,599
extractive group I hope I hope this

1536
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:40,500
helps I know it's not as concrete as one

1537
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,440
might want but um I'm sure people with

1538
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,540
much more experience in these fields

1539
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,099
would have much better answers for you

1540
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,000
I have a question

1541
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,160
that I've long had about some of your

1542
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,900
different research projects which you

1543
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,280
presented here

1544
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,799
often there's this

1545
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,079
modeling of both the view from the

1546
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,079
inside with phenomenology

1547
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,960
and also a view from the outside

1548
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,000
so

1549
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,099
what can you say about active inference

1550
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,240
and that

1551
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,859
like what

1552
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:18,540
what does that mean where does that come

1553
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,680
from

1554
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,299
how does that matter for the personal

1555
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:24,259
and the social

1556
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,859
so imagine a marker blanket

1557
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:31,740
every Mark of blanket entails there's an

1558
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,079
outside and inside now you can always

1559
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,780
read drawings you can always consider

1560
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,220
it's wider smaller inside your marker

1561
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,380
blankets there are Mark of blankets it's

1562
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,839
all Market blankets all the way down

1563
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,099
so this notion of internal and external

1564
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:53,160
is only useful in relation to the

1565
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,720
measurement of a joint probability

1566
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,940
that's it

1567
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,140
it's not

1568
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,180
it's not ontological in the sense like

1569
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,440
you you can I can consider that my cells

1570
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,480
also have are have like an internal

1571
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,059
model and an external model and I'm just

1572
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:15,540
some emergent scale given the connection

1573
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,880
between all these models that have an

1574
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,960
internal and external model

1575
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,000
um this group right now has a mark of

1576
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
blankets which means us we have spoken

1577
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,980
and people who have not spoken to us do

1578
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,960
not have access to this information here

1579
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,640
and in order to exchange information

1580
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,619
they'll probably have to speak to some

1581
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:36,839
of us and so they'll be

1582
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:37,740
um

1583
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:40,559
there will be an action that we put upon

1584
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,319
the world as a group with some degree of

1585
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,299
cohesion over time

1586
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:47,400
so I think

1587
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,500
um we have to understand internal and

1588
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,960
external really in those terms in terms

1589
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,119
of

1590
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,040
temporality and objective

1591
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,980
outside of that these are illusory

1592
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,579
boundaries they're they they're not real

1593
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:04,680
and because they're not real we can sort

1594
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,359
of issue

1595
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:08,880
um essentialism like

1596
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,220
if a boundary can always be redrawn

1597
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:15,119
relative to some kind of Observer then

1598
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,160
everything is always Observer relative

1599
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,160
there's and there's no such thing as a

1600
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,020
thing which is a thing in itself it's

1601
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,680
always relational it's always phenomenal

1602
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,839
and how does this tie to phenomenality

1603
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,078
well

1604
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,000
because we are talking through this

1605
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,859
Market blanket because we're like we we

1606
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:38,160
don't actually have access to the rest

1607
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,900
of the world except through this

1608
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,039
boundary

1609
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,780
the internal model is what effectively

1610
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,700
Wiggles relative to the external world

1611
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,319
and therefore

1612
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:53,339
um you get phenomenality from this

1613
01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:56,579
remodeling of the external World from

1614
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,900
this uh given boundary so for instance

1615
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,839
our group's phenomenality of everybody

1616
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,960
else is our shared representation of who

1617
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,940
that even means of what that even means

1618
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,960
we have this phenomenal

1619
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,099
representation of that group we could

1620
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,780
even potentially

1621
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,740
um create

1622
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,359
um

1623
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:21,359
symbols for them we could create actual

1624
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,940
representations which would become kind

1625
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,220
of what would constitutes

1626
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,640
um qualia at the level of our group so

1627
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,799
yeah I think I've answered your question

1628
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:34,680
I get lost in my thoughts sometimes but

1629
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,960
it's great all right I'm gonna read a

1630
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,180
comment from Abel who just requested

1631
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,559
this comment to be read

1632
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,240
FL wrote

1633
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,099
I'd like to add some things about the

1634
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,500
ideology question you have a diversity

1635
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,839
of definitions of ideology for the

1636
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,520
purposes of the demonstration I'll

1637
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,480
cluster them into two one

1638
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,619
post-structuralist in this context an

1639
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:57,900
ideology is any system of value or of

1640
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,640
instrumentation of the world this is the

1641
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,500
definition malused in this case

1642
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,900
everything is ideology because the basic

1643
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,119
way we perceive the world is value

1644
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:09,420
written and two structuralist

1645
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,180
in this context an ideology is a system

1646
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,579
of discourse that dominates a given

1647
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,259
social context

1648
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,420
for structuralist definitions to apply

1649
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,060
you need a lot more than shared values

1650
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,460
you need a clergy that maintains and

1651
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,380
diffuses the specific discourse

1652
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,080
underlying the ideology

1653
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,880
I have a limited Insight in the

1654
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,920
historical evidence but as of my

1655
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,439
understanding ideology as factor of mass

1656
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:36,359
mobilization is pretty much an early

1657
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:39,779
modern particularism

1658
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:46,339
I was reading

1659
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,759
um

1660
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,920
I mean I feel like I feel like some if

1661
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,660
we cast it in terms of active inference

1662
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,000
it would be um

1663
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
the active States right like you need

1664
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,640
um you need something which acts upon

1665
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,160
the world in order to create the

1666
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,660
self-evidencing you require and that

1667
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,000
would be like the clergy right you need

1668
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,920
to push these beliefs onto the world you

1669
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,600
can't just sort of let them happen

1670
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,460
especially if we talk about Precision

1671
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,319
right because remember everything

1672
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,640
Wiggles everything's always

1673
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,920
non-stationary we move we change we

1674
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,540
interpret we reinterpret those degrees

1675
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,479
of uncertainty so how do we make sure

1676
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:24,839
that we continue over time right that we

1677
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:26,698
don't just dilute that our boundary

1678
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:28,620
stays very strong that's what I was

1679
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,479
discussing earlier with the with the

1680
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,219
groups that want to be able to avoid

1681
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:35,399
extractivism you need to proselytize you

1682
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:38,399
need to make sure the same narratives we

1683
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,500
return we always return to that same

1684
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,439
narrative and how if we look at like

1685
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,420
the clergy for instance

1686
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,560
um I don't know if it was a mistake or

1687
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,140
not but for a Time the only way to

1688
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:51,359
preach was in Latin which means the only

1689
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,120
way to access the word of God was

1690
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,760
through these people who not only

1691
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,580
um had to give you the word of God but

1692
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,900
they also controlled what it meant

1693
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,120
because you don't speak like now speak

1694
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,280
Latin and I'm gonna believe you you you

1695
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,760
have that knowledge so um it it goes

1696
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,800
back to these structures of power where

1697
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,719
there's some people that have more

1698
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,840
access to influencing others right they

1699
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,580
can push their beliefs with more

1700
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,460
Precision on others and others just kind

1701
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,960
of have to follow because they have no

1702
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,140
real way to

1703
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,520
themselves interpret and potentially

1704
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,840
shift narrative themselves

1705
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,219
when you do that I feel like I'm praying

1706
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:37,920
oh there's just a lot there's a lot

1707
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,920
there one part that I thought was very

1708
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,159
interesting was

1709
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,800
variational free energy is about

1710
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,219
observations and in what you had added

1711
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:52,380
just recently you talked about like the

1712
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,840
measurement of a joint probability

1713
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,300
there has to be like an aboutness of

1714
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,900
sensory observations for that thing

1715
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:05,280
otherwise it has not even a sensory it's

1716
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,100
not even an inanimate thing unless it

1717
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,960
has this

1718
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,400
that doesn't mean it's an interesting

1719
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,400
thing and I think that's what the recent

1720
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,540
work

1721
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:19,320
helps clarify with a sort of taxonomy

1722
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,500
from inner to more classically active

1723
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,219
control systems on through just

1724
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:27,239
the

1725
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:28,679
infinite

1726
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:31,380
possibilities of broadly cognitive

1727
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,300
modeling ecosystems of shared

1728
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,840
intelligence yeah

1729
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,420
I think that's a really interesting uh a

1730
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,159
really interesting distinction you just

1731
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,320
made so the the paper

1732
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,920
um by Lance and Co

1733
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,980
um

1734
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,659
maybe that is the key because I am okay

1735
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,760
so maybe this is a hot day but I I

1736
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,520
generally lean towards pan psychism I do

1737
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,739
believe that if Consciousness is the

1738
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:00,480
substrate then everything is some degree

1739
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,940
of conscious and we can stop using the

1740
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,500
word conscious and we can use the word

1741
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,040
model right there's a degree to which

1742
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,120
um there's a response uh between uh the

1743
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,520
the internal States of America blanket

1744
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,620
in the external States so there is some

1745
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,179
exchange of information there and

1746
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:19,860
whatever's done with the exchange maybe

1747
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,820
nothing and this may be the um the

1748
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,840
aboutness

1749
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,800
your internal model has no aboutness

1750
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,820
it's just

1751
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,980
there's information that was inputted

1752
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,320
and the only thing that it outputs is a

1753
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,000
constants of its boundary and that's

1754
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,880
that's it and therefore in order to have

1755
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,460
aboutness you have to have

1756
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,540
the possibility for your internal States

1757
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:48,120
um to shift to to move your boundaries

1758
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,880
somehow towards something more specific

1759
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,860
to segregates

1760
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,500
um to to discretize the external world

1761
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,360
into things that have more or less

1762
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,239
valence relative to your objectives very

1763
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,640
very akin to what Donald Hoffman is

1764
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,600
suggesting basically

1765
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:11,219
building on that and throughout your

1766
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:15,060
your presentation I I got a sense of the

1767
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,520
kind of two cultures The Sciences and

1768
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,159
the humanities not that they were

1769
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,780
exactly being represented in the talk

1770
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,739
but

1771
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:25,679
in terms of excellent style and

1772
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,840
classical approach

1773
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,739
and the non-overlapping magisteria

1774
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:35,159
idea that they're sort of

1775
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,800
a separable

1776
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,500
technical

1777
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,600
from the social

1778
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,239
and it's even though it's it's widely

1779
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:46,739
clear

1780
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:49,560
that the the beliefs in the moment

1781
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,960
shape the niche that has these feedback

1782
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,159
things the development of top-down

1783
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:58,380
architectures in some way that become

1784
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,780
topped out affordances for

1785
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,420
those or other people at some future

1786
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,780
time

1787
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,260
so

1788
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,719
where do we go from there and just like

1789
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,560
thinking about that space you know in

1790
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,360
what how do you

1791
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,159
how do you approach chapter six of the

1792
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,580
textbook in terms of the recipe for the

1793
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:27,080
active inference generative model

1794
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:33,380
for a social setting for social setting

1795
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,440
I think

1796
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:45,380
we go from semantics

1797
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:49,620
and we map the semantics

1798
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:54,540
of a group and you you you qualify what

1799
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,340
that group is maybe the description

1800
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,860
length of that group is Extreme maybe

1801
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:01,440
the description length is um my neighbor

1802
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,960
your neighbor me and uh three of their

1803
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,580
cats but not the fourth you know what I

1804
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,320
mean like maybe

1805
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,179
there's a cluster there and we map the

1806
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:10,980
semantics of that group

1807
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,840
and it's very specific

1808
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,960
and then through those semantics there's

1809
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,940
an inherent

1810
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,340
um causal structures of structure of the

1811
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,500
beliefs through which we could together

1812
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,679
like our own little experts try to map

1813
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,440
well okay what are our states what are

1814
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,140
our observations how do we map to this

1815
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,360
um and we try to test that model

1816
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,420
and then let's assume that

1817
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,420
um we disagree so we're gonna have

1818
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,580
different kind of breakdowns of reality

1819
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,780
and we're going to test the different

1820
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,400
models in a sort of

1821
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,980
um Bayesian expansion or ooh Asian model

1822
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,620
reduction or just just you know testing

1823
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,360
different models and DCM style and

1824
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,580
seeing which one Maps better to the

1825
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,679
expected uh observations we're going to

1826
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,600
see given our model

1827
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,199
um

1828
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:00,239
and you can do this for anything you can

1829
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,159
do this for a small group of neighbors

1830
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,679
you can do this for a very large group

1831
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:06,739
of people you can do this for

1832
01:16:06,739 --> 01:16:09,179
participants research you can do this

1833
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:11,400
for medicine

1834
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,380
um I think it's really about

1835
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,520
how do people carve nature at its joints

1836
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,219
and can they point to the exact

1837
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:22,800
observations which they believe

1838
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,020
um are part of the carvings or not

1839
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,400
I think that's possible in social

1840
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,120
sciences it's just about

1841
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,179
taking the time to formalize how

1842
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:36,120
observations

1843
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,500
um

1844
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,739
map to the carving together I think

1845
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:44,718
social sciences generally tend to

1846
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,199
push back

1847
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,739
against a carving

1848
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:51,300
they will prefer

1849
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,520
something that resembles more a manifold

1850
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,699
like it's like it it Ebbs and flows and

1851
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,620
it's like there's some prototypical

1852
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,020
stuff but mostly it's there's stuff that

1853
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,699
could come in and out and stuff and

1854
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:06,239
that's fine you can be accounted for so

1855
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,960
um if you if if you look at different

1856
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,960
carvings you can say we can work them

1857
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,400
through on our own sort of probability

1858
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,920
and say well this is much less likely

1859
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,140
it's possible it fits within the carving

1860
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,120
but it's much less likely what about

1861
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,440
this well this is really really really

1862
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,080
really like let's let's put a

1863
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,480
probability on this and maybe to you the

1864
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,520
probability is zero zero zero zero zero

1865
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,600
zero one

1866
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,880
that's fine it's in there

1867
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,800
um I think they'd be more comfortable

1868
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,719
with something that's less binary and

1869
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,460
something that's more

1870
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,100
um curved and allows for new things to

1871
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,840
be added were we to disagree on

1872
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,159
inclusions Etc

1873
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,560
that's a great point on kind of a narrow

1874
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,239
note but to what you just said there

1875
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,699
let's just say that there's four options

1876
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:58,080
if our prior is one zero zero zero then

1877
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,199
the any number of evidence times zero

1878
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,060
stays zero so that's like essentially

1879
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,560
fixed and that's when the hyper

1880
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,480
parameter is fixed

1881
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,880
and then if you enable even a tiny

1882
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,360
amount of

1883
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,640
non-zero value and so it's like 0.99999

1884
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,760
and then a bunch of zeros then that can

1885
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,219
still rise off the Baseline and then

1886
01:18:20,219 --> 01:18:21,360
that's the whole question of attention

1887
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,659
and cognition is how do you stay aware

1888
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,699
of relevant Salient information

1889
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:30,000
relevance realization and all that

1890
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,140
um another point was about

1891
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,940
um the

1892
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,940
causal model from the outside the part

1893
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,620
that the person doesn't directly control

1894
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,960
there's no Direct Control in the octave

1895
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,800
generative models of action observations

1896
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,500
it has to go through the niche that's

1897
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,659
how the thing is defined

1898
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:54,120
and so only indirectly can observations

1899
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,460
be changed and so that's the kind of

1900
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,719
part that you don't have agency over

1901
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:00,420
literally although the other glass half

1902
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:03,060
full side is that is to the extent that

1903
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,520
you do have agency over that

1904
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,580
and then where that glass is and and

1905
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,800
what narrative

1906
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,140
actually puts water into the glass or

1907
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:17,400
not and then what is the glass half full

1908
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,040
glass half empty part

1909
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,560
it brings so much

1910
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,420
and just so much like on the personal

1911
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,100
thought

1912
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,580
size but also it's just really

1913
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,140
interesting to see how this line of

1914
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,140
research which was more qualitative

1915
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,239
several years ago

1916
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:41,880
like in the 2016 to 18 time and just to

1917
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,699
see how different motifs

1918
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:46,980
have come into play with the generative

1919
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,320
models and

1920
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:53,340
so it's a pretty cool lecture and many

1921
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,159
people appreciated your work in the chat

1922
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,360
so that's cool do you have any other

1923
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,920
comments or anything you want to talk

1924
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,120
about

1925
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,300
no but uh I would um I'm gonna have to

1926
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,640
go in about two minutes but uh I would

1927
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,020
like to encourage people to really

1928
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,480
participate in the next one to read some

1929
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,980
texts

1930
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,020
um and to to express their ideas because

1931
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,679
this is how we we

1932
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,840
percolates percolates this is how we

1933
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,360
percolate good ideas and future research

1934
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,620
and the field of social sciences is ripe

1935
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,420
for this there's so much that can be

1936
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,120
done right now translated connected like

1937
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,580
we can get towards a confluent time in

1938
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,500
research and um

1939
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,140
and science

1940
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,080
all right really looking forward to the

1941
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,900
discussion and hoping that people engage

1942
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,060
in this

1943
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,780
affordance

1944
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,640
thank you see ya bye
