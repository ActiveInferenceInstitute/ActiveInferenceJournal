97160	464530	01:37	Use active inference to model collective behaviors with various environmental constraints. In active inference, you have correspondence between dynamical constraints like information over where the system is and belief that the system holds. What are the challenges and potential solutions in using active inference?

467220	1030040	07:47	The Dictionary of Cognitive Biases approach to modeling human behavior. This kind of open ended evolution of the intentional states of the agent can be addressed in a more meaningful way with active inference than with any other formal framework. What are some advantages precisely?	The Dictionary of Cognitive Biases approach to modeling human behavior has some challenges	Active Inference and the Future of Science
1030110	1456530	17:10	There could be some developments like in message passing algorithms or interoperability of different generative models. You have important compatibility, interoperability result between major fields of physics. How does science as a social activity ground our work or give us more?	What you said about message passing is interesting to me	Quantum Science: Interoperability
1458630	2076640	24:18	How can or does a framework theory articulate with moral, normative, ethical, deontic considerations? The most natural way to derive ethics from something like an activism or something like active inference is that both those framework are centered around biological individuation. It is hard, if not impossible, to derive positive results if someone tried to do it.

2077060	2499560	34:37	Active inference can be a jumping off point for other directions. One straightforward way to relate ethics to active inference is ethics like not ethics normativity as a social feminine. To have formulation between the two is probably not possible, at least highly nontrivial.	The work of active inference modeling can be in what it leads to	Inertial Ethics and the Network
2504380	2863680	41:44	How are higher order beliefs about doing better than expected, prediction error minimization integrated into the architecture of the agent's internal model of external dynamics? How does that articulate with these broader, very deep and fundamental human social contexts?	How does a free energy principle articulate with these broader, fundamental human social contexts	Free Energy Inference and Human Social Psychology
2875080	3050990	47:55	Where can I find the recommended reading list mentioned in the lectures? You it's. Just go to the big table and find the slides. We would like to also do more bibliographic work so that the books that people mention we can also have in that open source versioned journal.	Where can I find the recommended reading list mentioned in the lectures	Active Inference Journal
3052660	3129124	50:52	Next step is, did a lot of people register for the presenting in the conclusion session? I haven't gotten any specific responses or like titles yet. We're just kind of exploring and seeing what the people who are following along live want to do.	Next step is, did a lot of people register for the presenting in conclusion session	One last message for the course
3129322	3137040	52:09	Cool. Thank you, then. See you, AVO. Ciao.	All right. Thank you, then. Bye.	Hello, How are you?
