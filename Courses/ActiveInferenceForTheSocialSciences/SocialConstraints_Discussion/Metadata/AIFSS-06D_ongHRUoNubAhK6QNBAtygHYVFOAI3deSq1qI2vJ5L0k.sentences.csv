6180	6730	1	A	0.69	You.
8780	9432	2	A	0.99991	Hello.
9566	10824	3	A	0.97233	Welcome, everyone.
11022	14680	4	A	0.98	It is October 25, 2023.
14830	20772	5	A	0.99856	We're in active inference for the social sciences, and today we're in a discussion section.
20916	29690	6	A	1.0	It is Avel and I, and we'll start off by just saying hello and kind of reflecting on where we're at with the course.
30380	35760	7	A	0.9998	Then in we have the questions form that is on the course website.
35830	37360	8	A	0.99931	It's in the video description.
38020	41250	9	A	0.99996	Feel free to submit questions via this form.
41780	51428	10	A	1.0	And then today we're going to look at the questions that have been submitted and not answered yet, and we'll just give some thoughts on them.
51514	55868	11	A	0.99997	Also look for more questions to arise in the live chat.
56064	61220	12	A	0.99257	So with that, what do you want to begin with, Avel?
61380	72510	13	A	0.99961	Feel free to give any kind of overview or statement, and then we'll jump to the specific questions that have been submitted before today and during today.
73520	78268	14	B	0.7	The only statement that I want to make is the last presentation I did.
78354	88080	15	B	0.99702	So prediction cause constraints to exist would be our wealth summary of that.
88230	96630	16	B	0.59651	But really, I don't have anything to say that is more specific right now.
97160	100548	17	A	1.0	All right, well, this should be pretty fun.
100634	103350	18	A	0.97745	Let's jump into some questions.
105400	106150	19	A	0.93316	Okay.
108860	117880	20	A	0.59141	What are the challenges and potential solutions in using active inference to model collective behaviors with various environmental constraints?
121550	131578	21	B	0.76499	Um, so the challenges first is that in any model, you have to pick what you include and what you did not include.
131674	138350	22	B	0.99654	So when you talk about boundary conditions, when you talk about what's including the model, you have to make hypothesis.
138430	144050	23	B	0.97813	Like, if I tell you model another country that is under sanctions, like North Korea or Russia.
144470	145954	24	B	0.70002	Okay, how do you model that?
145992	149254	25	B	0.99869	Do you make a set pace for every possible product?
149452	160226	26	B	0.99999	Like, every dimension accounts for a specific product or type of product, and you have a zero if you have access to sorry, a zero if you don't have access to it, and one if you have access to it.
160348	168074	27	B	0.80855	Okay, but what if we have new things that happen that is not very useful if you're interested in innovation or something?
168192	174734	28	B	0.99726	So you will have to make specific policies that will produce specific questions that you want to ask to the model.
174932	181520	29	B	1.0	And using active inference does not change anything to that.
182710	212970	30	B	0.84	And where it is relevant is that you can have endogenous evolution of constraints using act inference, I think, in a more meaningful sense than you'd have with a pure, let us say, Hebian or non representational framework or a framework that is representational, but where the space presentation is like, hard coded.
213550	236450	31	B	0.99511	So there is a space of models, let us say, of evolution of social norms, where I think active inference would have an edge because active inference is built to represent normativity and intentionality, and it is not the case, to my knowledge, of other, like, either dynamicist or cognitiveist frameworks for modeling.
241430	245380	32	A	0.99989	Could you maybe restate and go into a little more detail?
246010	250760	33	A	0.99994	Was it non representational or indirect specification of what?
252650	255480	34	B	1.0	Of the beliefs of the system.
256010	258246	35	A	0.99886	So what's being directly specified?
258358	259510	36	A	0.92104	What's directly specified?
259590	262250	37	A	0.51	And then what is being indirectly specified?
263390	264726	38	B	0.99954	In active inference?
264838	284130	39	B	0.50509	Yeah, in active inference, you have, at least in a sense, correspondence between dynamical constraints like information over where the system is and belief that the system holds that are akin to norms or internal states.
284200	289522	40	B	0.99932	So beliefs or intentions are things that are going on inside.
289656	296166	41	B	1.0	And to my knowledge, there is no framework that makes an explicit formal connection between the two.
296188	304518	42	B	0.95148	You'd have dynamic framework where you have stuff that happens and there is no presentation or intentional states.
304684	326560	43	B	1.0	And you have things like utility theory where you have to specify preemptively what are the intentional states of the agents, which are not very relevant to represent the endogenous evolution of social constraints within a collective system.
327730	335380	44	B	0.84786	So situation where active inference would be useful is to model.
338230	341442	45	B	1.0	I will try to remember the term Stuart Kauffman used.
341576	346980	46	B	0.21261	Kaufmane fillin and fillin in.
353210	356390	47	B	0.79915	So I will share the can we both share the screen?
356460	357502	48	B	0.99961	No, we can't.
357666	363820	49	A	1.0	You can add it directly in this coda page.
367150	376090	50	A	0.99936	Probably a little easier than just go to the back end course code of page and then follow the token.
376170	376800	51	A	0.81	Yes.
377250	379998	52	A	1.0	And then go to the questions table and pop it out.
380084	382560	53	B	0.84	I don't have the questions that is on your screen.
386530	394660	54	A	0.99972	Just click on the little challenges and potential solutions and then pop it out.
402060	405290	55	B	0.57	It pop out what?
407340	409228	56	A	0.99978	Just like next to the row.
409244	410800	57	A	0.90637	See this expand row?
411220	413170	58	A	1.0	And then you'll be in the same place.
414820	415836	59	B	0.99998	What is the row?
415868	416450	60	B	0.91	C.
416980	418460	61	B	0.98718	There is no letters.
418620	419376	62	A	0.83846	No.
419558	422820	63	A	0.99982	Just look visually at the expand row.
424920	427072	64	B	0.94634	Look visually at the expand row.
427216	436520	65	A	1.0	Just click the expand row on the question that we're addressing and you'll pop into this campus.
437260	442920	66	B	0.61	The question that we are addressing is not on the page, at least on my terminal.
443500	447112	67	A	0.99995	Are you looking at the public front end or at the course back end?
447166	448968	68	B	0.60318	I'm looking at the back end.
449134	449512	69	A	0.99516	Okay.
449566	450780	70	B	1.0	And I do not have a question.
450850	452540	71	B	0.9839	What are blah, blah, blah?
455520	457550	72	B	0.64	Oh, it is sub question.
458480	459740	73	B	0.99933	What are the challenges?
460900	461760	74	A	0.48403	Okay, cool.
461830	462610	75	A	0.98	All right.
463780	464530	76	A	0.96881	Fun.
467220	468912	77	A	1.0	You were talking about Kaufman, though.
468966	469970	78	A	0.99992	What was it?
471140	486068	79	B	1.0	Yes, it's a paper that he co signed whose manator is Tepophilin critique of economic, like I say rationality, but now they say it's born in rationality.
486244	493240	80	B	0.99725	So the Dictionary of Cognitive Biases approach to modeling human behavior.
493820	503580	81	B	1.0	And basically the point of the paper, as I understand it, is that you have an evolution of the goals and norms that shape a social ecology.
504000	520530	82	B	1.0	And this kind of open ended evolution of the intentional states of the agent, I think, can be addressed in a more meaningful way with active inference than with any other formal framework I know.
532540	534920	83	A	0.98312	There are several other aspects, I think.
534990	542540	84	A	0.99995	So first to kind of restate the challenges and then go to the potential solutions and the advantages.
543520	555292	85	A	0.96599	Like the advantages in principle and in practice you started with identifying the major any kind of modeling challenges.
555356	575156	86	A	0.97553	So active inherits from all of these modeling challenges or areas that are difficult to step aside from and then depending on the resources of the group and whether it's 2023 or 2000 future time when there's different tooling.
575188	586696	87	A	0.9828	So that is just about the challenge of active inference sometimes compared today with more off the shelf approaches which also may or may not work.
586878	600224	88	A	0.99976	But in an active you'll be spending your time making something that may or may not work, may or may not be orders of magnitude more just sophistication of a modeling setting then the team is ready to again, that's a general modeling point.
600262	618016	89	A	0.99998	But it's also very easy to get into with activ and to jump the gap between something that is pedagogical and helps show something like intuitive or cool and making something, for example, that can be used in high reliability settings.
618208	625468	90	A	1.0	And that's a jump that hasn't been necessarily conveyed in the open source setting.
625504	634952	91	A	0.99612	So it's difficult to see examples of whereas there's kind of like production type machine learning algorithms that can at least be no, that's just a little general point.
635086	639816	92	A	0.99323	So what are some advantages precisely?
640008	645272	93	A	0.9457	There's some really interesting concepts related to this like indirect specification.
645416	655440	94	A	0.99814	So like let's just say that we were talking about the mountain car example or a social variable that seemed to be moving within a certain range.
656260	664184	95	A	0.99999	Then the direct encoding of that constraint would be basically made outdated.
664252	670624	96	A	0.99531	Okay, now the landscape changes and then all of a sudden the mountain car can go twice as far to a different direction.
670752	682244	97	A	0.99996	So if that constraint had been explicitly encoded about cognitive variables or about the exposition of the mountain car, then the model goes stale.
682372	696668	98	A	1.0	But if what's encoded is somehow a relation with an agent in the environment so the mountain car has 10 can go left or right as its affordances and everything that builds from there.
696834	702850	99	A	1.0	And then here's the laws of physics or mechanics, such that here's the weight of the car.
703220	713216	100	A	0.61	And then if the landscape changes or is modeled as changing, then you get, oh, yeah, now it can go further or shorter.
713248	731960	101	A	0.99999	In this direction, but that's like an outcome of the relationship between the agent and the environment explicitly represented as such versus just looking at the outcome and then putting constraints on the outcome.
735920	750640	102	B	1.0	Yes, to say we have historically the concept of explanation that we have inherited from the 19th 20th century is that we explain by having a lawful relationship between variables.
751220	755500	103	B	0.99	And to do that we have to press specify what are the relevant variables.
755660	761460	104	B	0.99	And this is not a thing that exists with open ended evolutionary dynamics.
761800	767110	105	B	0.99992	This is all in the genital cognitive agency something paper.
771800	776472	106	B	0.87	And so when we ask questions to a model we don't want to have the answer.
776606	778644	107	B	0.99152	Yeah, it will evolve anxiously.
778692	779384	108	B	0.99997	We don't really know.
779422	786540	109	B	0.99995	This is not what is expected basically so we tend not to look at operanded evolutionary dynamics.
787120	810240	110	B	1.0	I would say that active inference has some leverage to represent that that other framework could not have because of the relationship between constraints as a clinical thing and beliefs as an intentional statement.
813320	814020	111	A	0.98762	Yeah.
814170	839630	112	A	1.0	One thing that makes me think of so when we're doing modeling based, outcome based modeling whether for hobby or for grad school, for job, we're often in a setting that either expects or rewards or accepts only a converging answer.
841520	849970	113	A	0.94265	Because it's being does insulin in drosophila change their circadian this or that?
851780	857170	114	A	0.99956	It's very converged of a question already and it's something where we're looking to reduce our uncertainty about.
858020	870324	115	A	0.99973	So then that closes off to the extent that it converges it closes off divergent routes not just of like doing and addressing that question.
870442	871924	116	A	0.99997	That's more of a methodological point.
871962	893704	117	A	0.99992	But then we don't make models that can see a more open ended horizon of what could actually happen in the system because that always adds more state spaces that can be broken and unfolded.
893832	906016	118	A	0.99996	So I guess again to the kind of kernel of the question you've written these very interesting sequence of papers about symmetry breaking and all of this.
906198	923940	119	A	0.99983	So how do you use that in a way that goes beyond just stating larger and larger state spaces or feeling less and less confident when it seems like a large piece of this is that certain aspects of systems are unprestatable.
926380	927204	120	B	0.9992	Sorry, confident.
927252	931160	121	A	0.95209	But what precisely unprestatable?
932140	933620	122	B	0.52422	Unprestatable?
933700	945580	123	B	1.0	Yes, I'm confident that you cannot prestate the space of possibilities or space of belief that an agent can have and model upon an evolution.
945920	955004	124	B	0.99915	Something that could like that is by definition of the terms something that could be argued is that there is no such thing as a plane devolution.
955052	972390	125	B	0.99999	But that would be a very bold thing to claim and most people would not say that explicitly ever because it's kind of obviously not the case.
972860	975290	126	B	0.79417	If there is argument for it, I'd like to hear it.
978380	1016468	127	B	0.86624	But the argument that are stated against the upper ended evolution thing are basically, you have, I would say, all rely on a confusion between the fact that the law of physics work, which they do, and the idea that the specific language that physics talks is a full and objective representation of everything there is or could be, which is like it's a possibility we can discuss about it.
1016474	1018880	128	B	0.99991	But this is a distinct possibility.
1018960	1023270	129	B	0.98811	That the statement that the law of physics work, which again they do.
1028700	1030040	130	A	0.90631	Okay, cool.
1030110	1047448	131	A	0.99861	Well then just to sort of close on this octave advantages many interesting conceptual advantages, we hope analytical and more transdisciplinary or more holistically.
1047624	1057120	132	A	1.0	And also another huge piece is it's connected to an always improving open source computational environment?
1057620	1066708	133	A	0.99979	We expect and prefer but in that case linking a system in year X social system or model.
1066794	1090670	134	A	0.99978	It's kind of like using a Linux system that there could be some developments like in message passing algorithms or interoperability of different generative models or category theoretic augmentation of models that are connected to the active inference ontology all these different kinds of synthetic technologies which we can basically already imagine and to some extent already have.
1091440	1099820	135	A	1.0	It becomes a way to map systems to a lot.
1099970	1124760	136	A	1.0	And that is not, as far as I understand, possible without kind of a first principles and ecosystems of shared intelligence and all these other kind of memes and themes that we talk about all the time, surprise, minimization things, doing as most likely for them to do, paths of least action, Bayesian mechanics.
1125580	1148300	137	A	0.99941	Then there's a continuity of explanation with the rock just being there and the investor trading with this strategy, an instrumental unifying account that makes relatively minimal claims about the territory that includes the rock and the investing activity.
1151220	1152610	138	A	0.60355	What did you add in.
1156200	1171304	139	B	0.99971	What you said about message passing is interesting to me because you have a broad coalition of physicists, mathematicians, social scientists, people in academia who basically think there is one language to nature and what we do as scientists is to discover it.
1171502	1174424	140	B	0.97	And I do not think that holds water.
1174542	1179548	141	B	0.86106	Not only because open evolution is a thing which is a sufficient element actually.
1179634	1181772	142	B	0.98769	But if you look at Mr.
1181826	1206324	143	B	0.2655	Spacing, if you look at Quantum Basinism, if you look at category theory, open formally and conceptually the possibilities that there are different languages in the world and they may be more or less interoperable and they may be non reducible to each other and then you start to ask collision questions.
1206442	1219124	144	B	0.99649	I'd say especially when implicitly or explicitly you are interested in what determines the fact that a specific language works in a specific context.
1219252	1226332	145	B	0.93044	Why is not going to go further down the math road.
1226386	1226990	146	A	0.8811	But.
1230960	1240320	147	B	1.0	You have important compatibility, interoperability result between major fields of physics.
1243780	1248220	148	B	1.0	I will give a reference by John Bayes.
1248300	1249456	149	B	1.0	I don't know you pronounce it.
1249478	1251250	150	B	0.99	I never said this.
1259640	1277660	151	B	0.53541	So we have important interoperability results in fields of physics and formal science and we don't have a proof, however, that all possible presentation of physics are interoperable.
1281760	1282860	152	B	0.99882	How do you say that?
1282930	1286964	153	B	0.90734	Interoperable, interoperable, interoperable.
1287032	1289090	154	B	0.8316	Okay, so they said it's wrong.
1290100	1292400	155	A	0.89555	No, it's a great point.
1292470	1298828	156	A	0.95	And what's really interesting is like the relationship between Bayes graphs.
1298924	1308820	157	A	1.0	First off, Bayes graphs being analytically described and then computationally implementable is on the order of decades old.
1308970	1331080	158	A	1.0	And then as we kind of explored just yesterday in Live Stream 55.0, the relationship between the Bayes graph and forney graphs which enabled message passing to be done procedurally to optimize a Bayes graph which just brings all of these computational, all these analytical connections.
1331160	1337570	159	A	0.9995	But that wasn't understood until it was and that was only slightly over two decades ago.
1338500	1353620	160	A	0.89407	So then in fact, those kinds of results and developments reflect the changing social and scientific niche.
1353960	1365930	161	A	0.99994	So I don't know, maybe this is a different question, but science as a social activity and then I don't know, how does that ground our work or give us more?
1367020	1367770	162	A	0.99976	What.
1369500	1388240	163	B	0.93919	So about the whole language thing, I don't know where it's at now, but at least ten years ago it seemed that you can have message passing.
1388740	1399936	164	B	0.94	You can have bias and coherence of state of observable that does not rely explicitly on the probabilities as in a dispersion that is embedded in a specific set space.
1400038	1405860	165	B	1.0	You can have bias and coherence that preexist to the representation in which probability is embedded.
1406360	1423844	166	B	1.0	And if there was a way to cross this and message passing, you'd have a pretty straightforward road to straighter account of contextuality and social construction.
1423892	1425980	167	B	0.72	I said this with scare quotes.
1427600	1429192	168	A	0.99984	Great note.
1429336	1436088	169	A	0.99986	Exciting for quantum context and quantum social and scripts and constraints and norms.
1436264	1438768	170	A	0.79245	Let's close that question for now, though.
1438854	1439200	171	A	0.99995	Nice.
1439270	1439890	172	A	0.74428	Okay.
1445490	1447982	173	A	0.65515	How can yeah, great question.
1448036	1449022	174	A	0.99998	Thank you to whoever asked.
1449076	1450234	175	A	1.0	And again, video description.
1450282	1456530	176	A	1.0	You can ask it'll appear and we'll see if anyone writes more questions during the stream.
1458630	1469110	177	A	0.99999	How can or does a framework theory, principle of everything articulate with moral, normative, ethical, deontic considerations?
1476270	1484330	178	B	0.99107	So I think it is addressed in a good amount of detail by an activist.
1484410	1489550	179	B	0.99998	How you relate a theory of biological individuation to a theory of ethics.
1490690	1502002	180	B	1.0	I do not have a good grip on this literature, so I have high level intuitive opinion on that.
1502056	1504500	181	B	0.99997	But this is not like state of the art.
1505210	1518070	182	B	0.57	And okay, basically I'd say this flows well with stoic virtue etics.
1519050	1521894	183	B	0.99932	Things act according to the nature.
1522022	1525820	184	B	0.99995	So you may as well work so that your nature is good.
1526430	1531710	185	B	1.0	And then you have recursivity in accounting what is good and what is not.
1531860	1537310	186	B	1.0	And I do not see straightforward analytical way to resolve this ambiguity.
1537970	1539642	187	B	1.0	I said circularity or ambiguity.
1539706	1540720	188	B	0.99934	Both apply.
1546850	1547310	189	A	0.58119	Yeah.
1547380	1563030	190	B	0.99758	So I think Evan Thompson has worked nuts and may have a much better answer to how we relate theories of being and theories of physics.
1563370	1565160	191	B	0.31	Oh, Varila did actually.
1569950	1591870	192	A	0.99937	Yeah, I guess my sort of short answer would there would be first just we would have to hear a lot more even possible perspectives, but without even hearing them can at least maybe say that there is an articulation and a meter stick as an instrument.
1592710	1599406	193	A	1.0	And this kind of goes actually to that question about the Bayes spaces and what is preconditioned.
1599438	1612470	194	A	0.99866	So in what ways is the meter stick articulate with downstream ethical frameworks?
1613130	1614214	195	A	0.9997	What ought to be done?
1614252	1641680	196	A	0.93386	Or just normative more broadly, there's downstream decisions that the meter stick is agnostic too, and then the meter stick is also a social result that is itself downstream of other norms and constraints, biotic abiotic constraints, regularities of space time.
1645650	1662002	197	B	0.81	I would say what we can do with theory of sense making, be it active inference or inactivism, is to just describe what we mean by normativity analytics?
1662066	1664870	198	B	0.99999	What are the underlying natural processes?
1665210	1667898	199	B	0.9928	When I say natural, I do not mean by opposition to social.
1667984	1672300	200	B	0.68543	Those processes are biological and social at the same time.
1673390	1681722	201	B	1.0	And that may bring reflexivity or distance to account of normativity.
1681786	1687082	202	B	0.99998	That may prove some of them incoherent or ill advised.
1687226	1692662	203	B	0.99944	That will not give you a solution to what is ethical and what is not, notably.
1692746	1709006	204	B	0.99858	Because the most natural way to derive ethics from something like an activism or something like active inference is that both those framework are centered around biological individuation.
1709198	1712614	205	B	0.82605	So we may say that biological individuation is good.
1712652	1718034	206	B	0.99992	Actually, that sounds sensible, but then the question is biological individuation for whom?
1718162	1723094	207	B	0.99995	Because you have a right, I guess, or desire will at least to exist.
1723142	1727546	208	B	0.91713	But soros cancer cells within your body, who trumps who?
1727648	1728506	209	B	1.0	I don't know.
1728608	1730480	210	B	0.99976	Not from a purely sweetie account.
1732770	1754414	211	B	0.99999	There is no way you can straightforwardly, ambiguously derive a prescriptive notion of good from any physics, any descriptive account of the world you will love when you do, when you make nomadic claims, you have goals because you are linking and because of active inference enactivists.
1754542	1762120	212	B	0.99999	We know that cognition is embedded in no activity, in the autonomy, in the biological activity of the agent.
1762570	1770220	213	B	0.99997	So the theory that you are framing is in some way motivated, even if you don't know how or admit that it is.
1770750	1782010	214	B	1.0	And then I'd say from there it does not quite destroy the project of an objective system of ethics, but it makes it much harder to refund.
1783890	1798260	215	B	0.99891	So yeah, I'd say you can derive a lot of negative results from descriptive theory of like, I wouldn't say ethics because ethics are non descriptive, but descriptive theory of how ethics come to be.
1798630	1808246	216	B	1.0	I would say that it is hard, if not impossible, to derive positive results if someone tried to do it.
1808348	1810520	217	B	0.69695	I'd like to see what this is.
1815050	1815702	218	A	0.99673	Wow.
1815836	1816326	219	A	0.99999	Thank you.
1816348	1817190	220	A	0.81758	Avil.
1817550	1820170	221	A	0.91871	That last piece was very interesting.
1820320	1842960	222	A	0.99985	Many results, many ant colonies with their behavior to model many real situations, to understand social constraints and norms in instrumentally with descriptions that are then in the discussion section of the paper.
1843730	1848110	223	A	1.0	And the data are the data and those are the descriptive aspects.
1848190	1855306	224	A	0.99817	It's a different kind of data in a slight way, but there's already enough to describe and interpret from what would be merely described.
1855438	1862598	225	A	1.0	And it is very hard to derive positive results first.
1862684	1874730	226	A	0.99996	It's a hard domain to make positive results in not just ones that make people feel good, but by positive, like positivism, like justified, true assertions about a metaphysical space.
1874880	1881774	227	A	0.70422	So it's hard to derive positive results about normativity and the kind of areas that this person asked.
1881972	1895102	228	A	0.99998	These are all areas that are and it's hard to use a quantitative theory, which is almost it's an abstraction or it's just one language.
1895166	1906200	229	A	0.99995	It's hard to use that to make positive results external to the system, harder to make external to the system.
1906650	1911110	230	A	0.99999	Positive results internal to the system are dime a dozen.
1911450	1955480	231	A	0.9998	But then to really make that reflexive loop that you described between what is and what we expect and prefer, which is actually woven up in an interesting way in act INF rather than two kind of diverge timelines like, what we quote, expect to happen, like a prediction of the, likeliest, future and then a second timeline that's like, well, what I would really prefer to be doing in Actimp, the agent just has one expectation preference which loads up on the pragmatic value.
1957370	1967320	232	A	0.99995	But that gives a unified approach towards one's expectations of how things will be and what they expect prefer them to be.
1978980	1995430	233	B	0.7	I would say that at Vibe check level active inference flows well with the idea that empowerment is good actually but make it a formal relation would be quite hard.
1997080	2004600	234	B	1.0	You could say that inference vibes well with the notion that everyone knowing their place is good, which is quite the opposite.
2005920	2017390	235	B	0.99001	So I don't see an amigos relation between active inference and any ethical framework I can think of.
2018740	2030940	236	B	0.97	I would say again that it flows well with virtue ethics framework because of the relation between one's action and one's nature.
2031020	2044788	237	B	0.99998	According to axio inference, nature being here in Australia term, that is maybe not the best term, but I'm literally using production of before Christ text.
2044874	2055160	238	B	0.99936	So yeah, nature is not that bad, just not what we mean in the context of 19th 20th discussions.
2058800	2076640	239	A	0.99992	Yeah, that's a very complex topic with definitely a lot of rich work on our cities and people nature, our humans, animals and that sort of homo sapiens type discourse.
2077060	2096600	240	A	1.0	And then how does active inference frame the relationship with the niche in terms of entanglement or communication or co action, intra action, communication and influence through the blanket?
2097900	2100760	241	A	1.0	Where does that go beyond just describing?
2102140	2103192	242	A	1.0	It doesn't have to.
2103246	2110040	243	A	1.0	I think a sort of base level in what you referred to here is like that artifact.
2110120	2119840	244	A	1.0	The product of the work, which is what the work is about, can be a jumping off point for other directions.
2120420	2125890	245	A	1.0	And so the work of active inference modeling can be in what it leads to.
2127300	2138900	246	A	0.81702	It's not always internal to the model that the improved awareness or better decision is realized.
2147350	2167986	247	B	1.0	I can see one quite straightforward and I don't think it is entirely broken way to relate ethics to active inference is ethics like not ethics normativity as a social feminine is a collective phenomenon.
2168018	2169990	248	B	0.46774	It's about social relationships.
2170730	2200934	249	B	1.0	And you could apply descriptive theory of human behavior and like human social aggregated collective behavior to find out what traits in Australia are prone to survival or adaptivity and you could say that those traits are good actually by construction of what we mean by ethics.
2201082	2210850	250	B	0.99947	That could be Bayes Coherence claim and then you could be interested in what traits make organization durable.
2213190	2216230	251	B	0.85766	This is the only logically, straightforward way I see.
2216300	2225430	252	B	0.99996	But that would tend to identify as good things that I would not see as good.
2225500	2227398	253	B	0.99994	Like feudalism.
2227494	2229340	254	B	1.0	It lived quite a long time.
2230190	2242510	255	B	0.99687	Well, feudalism, let us say old school empires with no claimed representations or power by the, how do you say populace.
2244050	2255620	256	B	0.99	And you could basically renormalize this theory not around clock time but around.
2257830	2258146	257	A	0.99	I.
2258168	2263410	258	B	0.99812	Don'T know, metric of lifetime, how much things happen within organization.
2264170	2268520	259	B	0.71	And then you'd start having something that is less obviously wrong.
2269450	2284460	260	B	0.67	And you could have basically ethics be about optimization of specific parameters that can be addressed by descriptive framework, but you'd have to make a lot of jumps to get there.
2285630	2296780	261	B	1.0	And while I do not see an obvious problem to that, it is very possible that we would not like the conclusion of such optimization thing.
2297150	2308420	262	B	1.0	And again, if you want to model something, you have to decide what are the parameters of interest and you can be wrong about that.
2308790	2315720	263	B	0.88927	So here again, you do not have an ambiguous even at a purely descriptive level, you do not have an ambiguous application of anything to anything.
2320500	2323810	264	B	0.99725	Would say that more empowerment is good, actually.
2327140	2346410	265	B	1.0	And I would say this goes at many nested scales of organization and I would say it has somehow something to do to the physics of electrical integration, but only in a vibe check way.
2348700	2350250	266	A	0.99923	Nothing wrong with that.
2351740	2374050	267	A	0.99425	Yeah, especially with some of the recent work like the variational synthesis with eco evo devo and the connections between the statistical concepts of persistence or thinkness from free energy principle related to remeasurement of the observer or the organism of themselves.
2374500	2381364	268	A	0.99997	That concept of repeated measurement being compatible in our work and in other related works.
2381562	2392390	269	A	0.99999	Basically with fitness, if there's a height distribution of trees in the forest and then a certain time point later, the height distribution is the same.
2393980	2398920	270	A	0.99989	That was stabilizing dynamics.
2399260	2402920	271	A	0.99998	We could say stabilizing evolution or stabilizing selection.
2403500	2405980	272	A	0.99996	If it moved, it moved.
2407600	2424530	273	A	0.9	And so how do since there is such a coupling between things being as they are and basically what the distribution of what is there is described both this stoic way but also this kind of evolutionary biology way.
2425300	2450600	274	A	0.99993	So does active inference offer any other or complementary perspective other than just the kind of strengths and weaknesses of using fitness, phenotypic fitness or memetic fitness as its own justification?
2453820	2457848	275	B	1.0	To say that is to say that something is good because it exists.
2458024	2460590	276	B	0.99998	This is not a strong position to take.
2462000	2474960	277	B	0.99995	So this is why you'd have quite high level of difficulty to derive anything prescriptive from anything descriptive.
2475460	2477250	278	B	1.0	The function is not the same.
2477620	2480580	279	B	1.0	You can make relation between the two.
2480650	2492180	280	B	0.97463	No, ethics is purely blind about nature, of nature is purely ethically unmotivated.
2492760	2499560	281	B	0.99989	But to have formulation between the two is probably not possible, at least highly nontrivial.
2504380	2519996	282	A	0.99774	Okay, so to kind of close on this question how does a free energy principle as a principle for everything and active inference as an implementable framework for applying free energy principle systems.
2520108	2530360	283	A	0.99999	How does that articulate with these broader, very deep and fundamental human social contexts?
2530460	2544180	284	A	0.99124	Short answer seems to be it's a lot like other scientific ideas, inherits a lot of their challenges and frictions and situations.
2544600	2550330	285	A	0.99998	Also there appear to be some interesting promising routes or themes to weave in.
2551020	2580234	286	A	1.0	However, even with a very charitable or optimistic interpretation, there seems some in principle challenges with these areas that make certain kinds of claims, perhaps not even within the proximate understanding we have of active inference, but people should totally write in the live chat or add comments and stuff.
2580272	2582000	287	A	1.0	I mean it's just interesting question.
2583090	2603418	288	A	0.7916	Okay, how are higher order beliefs about doing better than expected at PEM?
2603514	2613646	289	A	0.9923	Probably prediction error minimization integrated into the architecture of the agent's internal model of external dynamics and itself in those dynamics.
2613838	2620786	290	A	0.99999	My thought here is that we have prior beliefs to fulfill certain self evidencing expectations, e.
2620808	2623170	291	A	1.0	G homeostatic predictions.
2623510	2647574	292	A	0.99999	But how do those interact with these higher order predictions which appear to my mind to deny or negate the fundamental priors insofar as they predict the agent to go over and above the levels of prediction error minimization which otherwise might be achieved by fulfilling those fundamental priors they gave their thought?
2647692	2649880	293	A	0.87157	Let's return to the original question.
2653390	2669630	294	B	0.44	I do not know like I know that comparison to a baseline homeostatic level of prediction arm innovation is quite important thing in the shop psychiatry, possibly in the work of park's homes.
2670130	2674590	295	B	1.0	I do not know how that's implemented actually in computational models.
2675170	2679390	296	B	0.9977	So I'd rather not answer progressively.
2680470	2683620	297	B	0.97702	Ben White should be more informed about these things.
2684790	2685202	298	A	0.92611	Yeah.
2685256	2686530	299	B	0.95232	Or maybe you Daniel.
2687130	2695590	300	A	0.6375	Well, I mean the word that seems to be doing the work is integrated.
2696890	2705766	301	A	0.99822	So higher beliefs about doing better than expected, prediction error minimization or we can just say free energy minimization.
2705958	2712540	302	A	0.99979	So this was explored in the active inference work.
2713250	2724790	303	A	0.99141	So if the free energy was decreasing as expected, it was associated with neutral valence.
2724970	2738150	304	A	0.74335	If things were improving better than expected it was associated with positive valence and if things were doing worse than expected, it was negative valence.
2738890	2754310	305	A	0.99769	So because of the ability to make hierarchical active models and just hierarchical bayesian models in general, it is possible to talk about these beliefs, about beliefs, metacognitive beliefs.
2754470	2769390	306	A	0.82138	So it is possible to make models that have expectations about how well even an optimization process is going to go and then a computational psychiatrist or whatever may associate that with the affect.
2771250	2777742	307	A	0.99999	How is that integrated into the agent's internal model of external dynamics?
2777806	2785586	308	A	0.99954	Well, shortest answer is to sketch it out how one sees it and then it becomes either there or not.
2785768	2804810	309	A	0.99997	But just in general, if the internal model includes these higher order beliefs about doing better than expected, then that's the agent's generative model that then interfaces or articulates with external dynamics.
2807790	2813462	310	A	0.99995	So you could have some environment that has environmental regularity or dynamics.
2813526	2816800	311	A	0.5551	Or that are influenceable or not.
2817250	2819294	312	A	0.91	And then you could deploy two agents.
2819412	2828094	313	A	0.66	One of them that has the baseline generative model and the other one has this doing better than expected layer that the questioner is asking about.
2828292	2846440	314	A	1.0	And then they can do parameter sweeps and maybe adding this higher order belief increases the state space a lot and so it increases the computational costs a lot, but some interesting pockets of behavior are found, or the behavior in that setting ends up looking the exact same, but in another setting it would have been different.
2847690	2863680	315	A	0.75	A lot of these questions point towards very important modeling questions which can basically only be pointed at because so much is going to depend on what the actual model goal is.
2875080	2884660	316	A	0.77744	Okay, where can I find the recommended reading list mentioned in the lectures?
2889560	2894540	317	A	0.22	You it's.
2899280	2910220	318	A	0.63373	So where we have the slides from the lecture, they're in live streams.
2910380	2912652	319	A	0.99998	Just go to the big table and find the slides.
2912716	2916870	320	A	1.0	If you find a lecture that doesn't have slides, just let us know and we'll add it.
2919000	2923940	321	A	0.9998	Where things were just mentioned in the lectures?
2924360	2926068	322	A	0.99681	That's a great question.
2926234	2949980	323	A	1.0	And our goal at the active inference journal, beyond just transcribing and publishing and adding captions and translating and everything of these live streams, we would like to also do more bibliographic work so that the books that people mention we can also have in that open source versioned journal.
2950640	2954636	324	A	0.99858	So we generate the first version of the transcript, people update it and improve it.
2954658	2955964	325	A	1.0	Oh, what was the name of that author?
2956012	2957824	326	A	0.99996	What book are they talking about here?
2958022	2963084	327	A	1.0	And then we can actually have a unified bibliography section for the stream.
2963132	2970212	328	A	0.99661	So if that sounds interesting to you and you'd benefit from it, then surely many, many others will too.
2970266	2978010	329	A	0.99668	So if you're excited to see that kind of active inference journal work, I highly encourage recommend it.
2979500	2981210	330	A	0.69417	Abel, what else will you add?
2984060	2987416	331	B	0.86614	Same I can have nothing to add.
2987598	2988330	332	A	0.99605	Yeah.
2990400	3000040	333	A	0.99601	Okay, well, we can look at some of the other questions that were added that others wrote.
3000200	3010290	334	A	0.99997	People in live chat can add question or they can go to the course website and ask a new question.
3014660	3025590	335	A	0.99989	Do you want to look at one of the previous ones or do you have any other just thoughts you want to bring up?
3027000	3027828	336	B	0.99884	Not really.
3027914	3030100	337	B	1.0	The first ones were answered.
3033740	3036072	338	B	0.99978	They were asked weeks ago.
3036126	3041880	339	B	0.9997	So there is a relatively low likelihood that going over them again would be very helpful.
3042040	3044460	340	B	0.99	I think we can cut the discussion.
3045680	3046428	341	A	0.99998	Cool.
3046594	3050990	342	B	0.72439	But the important things that are not treated now can be treated in conclusion anyway.
3052660	3056210	343	A	0.96354	Okay, so what are the next steps then for the course?
3057700	3063200	344	B	0.99999	Next step is, did a lot of people register for the presenting in the conclusion session?
3065480	3070070	345	A	1.0	I haven't gotten any specific responses or like titles yet.
3070920	3075270	346	B	0.79744	Okay, so we see if people do that.
3075960	3084632	347	A	0.9936	Yeah, we can write another message, including even a short video message or just a written one.
3084686	3094670	348	A	1.0	And then also ask specific people also if anyone is interested to present something, but they're not really sure the format or they want pre recorded.
3096320	3107310	349	A	0.97913	We're just kind of exploring and seeing what the people who are following along live want to do and also trying out things that we think futures will want to do too.
3109440	3114190	350	A	0.52095	So if someone has an idea on that, we're definitely open to it.
3114840	3124820	351	A	0.5	It any last thoughts?
3127480	3129124	352	B	0.99934	No, I am good.
3129322	3130070	353	A	0.99963	Cool.
3130680	3131590	354	A	0.93	All right.
3131960	3133110	355	A	0.99989	Thank you, then.
3134520	3135568	356	A	0.57867	See you, AVO.
3135664	3136448	357	B	0.8788	Ciao.
3136624	3137040	358	A	0.97723	Bye.
