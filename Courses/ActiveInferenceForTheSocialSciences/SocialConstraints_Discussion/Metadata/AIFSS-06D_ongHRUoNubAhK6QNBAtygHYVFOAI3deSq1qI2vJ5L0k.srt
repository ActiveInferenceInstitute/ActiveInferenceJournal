1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,730
You.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,884
Hello. Welcome, everyone. It is October

3
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:16,296
25, 2023. We're in active inference for

4
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:19,368
the social sciences, and today we're in

5
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:23,144
a discussion section. It is Avel and I,

6
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:25,640
and we'll start off by just saying hello

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,720
and kind of reflecting on where we're at

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,488
with the course. Then in

9
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,896
we have the questions form that is on

10
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:36,512
the course website. It's in the video

11
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,484
description. Feel free to submit

12
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:43,312
questions via this form. And then today

13
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:46,052
we're going to look at the questions

14
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:47,764
that have been submitted and not

15
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:50,292
answered yet, and we'll just give some

16
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,852
thoughts on them. Also look for more

17
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:55,868
questions to arise in the live chat.

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,416
So with that, what do you want

19
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:02,312
to begin with, Avel? Feel free to give

20
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:06,308
any kind of overview or statement,

21
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,036
and then we'll jump to the specific

22
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:10,696
questions that have been submitted

23
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,510
before today and during today.

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,044
The only statement that I want to make

25
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,990
is the last presentation I did. So

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,852
prediction cause constraints to exist

27
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:28,080
would be our wealth summary of that.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,640
But really, I don't have anything to say

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,630
that is more specific right now.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,876
All right, well, this should be pretty

31
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,350
fun. Let's jump into some questions.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,150
Okay.

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,028
What are the challenges and potential

34
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,496
solutions in using active inference to

35
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:56,020
model collective behaviors with various

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,880
environmental constraints?

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,710
Um, so the

38
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,190
challenges first is that in any model,

39
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,286
you have to pick what you include and

40
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:12,414
what you did not include. So when you

41
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,606
talk about boundary conditions, when you

42
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:16,786
talk about what's including the model,

43
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:19,026
you have to make hypothesis. Like, if I

44
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,586
tell you model another country that is

45
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,346
under sanctions, like North Korea or

46
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:26,146
Russia. Okay, how do you model that? Do

47
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:28,342
you make a set pace for every possible

48
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:31,762
product? Like, every dimension

49
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:33,894
accounts for a specific product or type

50
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:36,038
of product, and you have a zero if you

51
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:38,006
have access to sorry, a zero if you

52
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,318
don't have access to it, and one if you

53
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,546
have access to it. Okay, but what if we

54
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,426
have new things that happen that is not

55
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,874
very useful if you're interested in

56
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,714
innovation or something? So you will

57
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,710
have to make specific policies that will

58
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,518
produce specific questions that you want

59
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:55,946
to ask to the model. And using active

60
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:59,934
inference does

61
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:04,978
not change anything to that. And where

62
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:08,994
it is relevant is that you can

63
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:13,390
have endogenous evolution of constraints

64
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,654
using act inference, I think,

65
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,666
in a more meaningful sense than you'd

66
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,680
have with a pure, let us say, Hebian or

67
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,186
non representational framework

68
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:29,346
or a framework that is representational,

69
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,562
but where the space presentation is

70
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:35,530
like, hard coded. So there is a space

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,658
of models, let us say, of evolution of

72
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,318
social norms, where I think active

73
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:43,398
inference would have an edge

74
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,326
because active inference is built to

75
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,654
represent normativity and

76
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,862
intentionality, and it is not the case,

77
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,454
to my knowledge, of other, like, either

78
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:55,406
dynamicist or cognitiveist frameworks

79
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,450
for modeling.

80
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,338
Could you maybe restate and go into a

81
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,314
little more detail? Was it non

82
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,914
representational or indirect

83
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,760
specification of what?

84
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,480
Of the beliefs of the system.

85
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,246
So what's being directly specified?

86
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,314
What's directly specified? And then what

87
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:24,038
is being indirectly specified? In active

88
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:27,094
inference? Yeah, in active inference,

89
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,020
you have, at least in a sense,

90
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,522
correspondence between dynamical

91
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:35,662
constraints like information over where

92
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:38,670
the system is and belief that the system

93
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,480
holds that are akin to norms or

94
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,314
internal states. So beliefs or

95
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,866
intentions are things that are going

96
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,074
on inside. And to my knowledge, there is

97
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:54,130
no framework that makes an explicit

98
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,166
formal connection between the two.

99
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:59,334
You'd have dynamic framework where you

100
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:02,422
have stuff that happens and there is no

101
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:05,014
presentation or intentional states. And

102
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,122
you have things like utility theory

103
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:11,298
where you have to specify preemptively

104
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,626
what are the intentional states of the

105
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:18,970
agents, which are not

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,626
very relevant to represent the

107
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,478
endogenous evolution of social

108
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,560
constraints within a collective system.

109
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,142
So situation

110
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:34,302
where active inference would be useful

111
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,380
is to model.

112
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,274
I will try to remember the term Stuart

113
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:44,002
Kauffman used. Kaufmane fillin and

114
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:46,980
fillin in.

115
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,942
So I will share the can we both share

116
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,474
the screen? No, we can't. You can add it

117
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:03,206
directly in this coda

118
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:03,820
page.

119
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,986
Probably a little easier than just go to

120
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:14,926
the back end course code of page and

121
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,886
then follow the token. Yes. And then go

122
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,998
to the questions table and pop it out.

123
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:21,838
I don't have the questions that is on

124
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:22,560
your screen.

125
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,254
Just click on the little challenges

126
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,066
and potential solutions and then pop it

127
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:34,660
out.

128
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,290
It pop out what?

129
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,744
Just like next to the row. See this

130
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:52,336
expand row? And then you'll be in the

131
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:55,836
same place. What is the row?

132
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:58,460
C. There is no letters.

133
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,064
No. Just look visually at the expand

134
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:05,712
row. Look visually

135
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,592
at the expand row. Just click the expand

136
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:12,996
row on

137
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,756
the question that we're addressing and

138
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:17,672
you'll pop into this campus. The

139
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,912
question that we are addressing is not

140
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,920
on the page, at least on my terminal.

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,320
Are you looking at the public front end

142
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,864
or at the course back end? I'm looking

143
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,296
at the back end. Okay. And I do not have

144
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,540
a question. What are blah, blah, blah?

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,550
Oh, it is sub question.

146
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,760
What are the challenges? Okay, cool.

147
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,530
All right. Fun.

148
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,912
You were talking about Kaufman, though.

149
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:52,708
What was it? Yes, it's a paper

150
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:55,956
that he co signed whose manator is

151
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,580
Tepophilin critique of economic,

152
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,716
like I say rationality, but now they say

153
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:07,290
it's born in rationality. So the

154
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,092
Dictionary of Cognitive Biases approach

155
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:14,616
to modeling human behavior. And

156
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:17,164
basically the point of the paper, as I

157
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:18,588
understand it, is that you have an

158
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:21,724
evolution of the goals and norms that

159
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:25,244
shape a social ecology. And this kind

160
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,524
of open ended evolution of the

161
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:30,416
intentional states of the agent, I

162
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:33,504
think, can be addressed in a more

163
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,520
meaningful way with active inference

164
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,276
than with any other formal

165
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:40,530
framework I know.

166
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,648
There are several other aspects, I

167
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:57,960
think. So first to kind of restate

168
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,172
the challenges and then go to the

169
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:02,540
potential solutions and the advantages.

170
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,364
Like the advantages in principle and in

171
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:10,204
practice you started with identifying

172
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:13,840
the major any kind of modeling

173
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,264
challenges. So active inherits from all

174
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:20,768
of these modeling challenges or areas

175
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:23,700
that are difficult to step aside from

176
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,236
and then depending on the resources of

177
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:31,092
the group and whether it's 2023

178
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:34,356
or 2000 future time when there's

179
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:37,704
different tooling. So that is just about

180
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:40,324
the challenge of active inference

181
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,064
sometimes compared today with more off

182
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,656
the shelf approaches which also may or

183
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:48,716
may not work. But in an active you'll be

184
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:49,996
spending your time making something that

185
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,604
may or may not work, may or may not be

186
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:55,420
orders of magnitude more just

187
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,464
sophistication of a modeling setting

188
00:09:57,512 --> 00:09:59,068
then the team is ready to again, that's

189
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:00,784
a general modeling point. But it's also

190
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:03,952
very easy to get into with activ and to

191
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:07,330
jump the gap between something that is

192
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,524
pedagogical and helps show something

193
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:13,972
like intuitive or cool and making

194
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,004
something, for example, that can be used

195
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,896
in high reliability settings. And that's

196
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:22,496
a jump that hasn't been necessarily

197
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,656
conveyed in the open source setting. So

198
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,192
it's difficult to see examples of

199
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,012
whereas there's kind of like production

200
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:31,656
type machine learning algorithms that

201
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:34,104
can at least be no, that's just a little

202
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:36,108
general point. So what are some

203
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:39,816
advantages precisely?

204
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:42,824
There's some really interesting concepts

205
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,184
related to this like indirect

206
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,396
specification. So like let's just say

207
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:47,956
that we were talking about the mountain

208
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:52,316
car example or a social variable

209
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,336
that seemed to be moving within a

210
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:58,396
certain range. Then the direct encoding

211
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:02,640
of that constraint would be

212
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,836
basically made outdated. Okay, now the

213
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:07,508
landscape changes and then all of a

214
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,236
sudden the mountain car can go twice as

215
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:11,732
far to a different direction. So if that

216
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:14,520
constraint had been explicitly encoded

217
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,504
about cognitive variables or about the

218
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,176
exposition of the mountain car, then the

219
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,700
model goes stale. But if what's encoded

220
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,388
is somehow a relation with an agent in

221
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,980
the environment so the mountain car has

222
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,596
10 can go left or right as

223
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,596
its affordances and everything that

224
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:38,336
builds from there. And then here's the

225
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:41,376
laws of physics or mechanics, such that

226
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:44,210
here's the weight of the car. And then

227
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,916
if the landscape changes or is modeled

228
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:51,156
as changing, then you get, oh, yeah,

229
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,396
now it can go further or shorter. In

230
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:56,404
this direction, but that's like an

231
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:59,124
outcome of the relationship between the

232
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:02,580
agent and the environment explicitly

233
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,680
represented as such versus

234
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,992
just looking at the outcome and then

235
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,960
putting constraints on the outcome.

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,928
Yes, to say we have historically

237
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,836
the concept of explanation that we have

238
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:26,108
inherited from the 19th 20th century is

239
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,844
that we explain by having a lawful

240
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:31,856
relationship between variables. And to

241
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:33,744
do that we have to press specify what

242
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:36,336
are the relevant variables. And this is

243
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:39,884
not a thing that exists with open ended

244
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:42,676
evolutionary dynamics. This is all in

245
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:46,260
the genital cognitive agency something

246
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,110
paper.

247
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,740
And so when we ask questions to a model

248
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,144
we don't want to have the answer. Yeah,

249
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:58,948
it will evolve anxiously. We don't

250
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,616
really know. This is not what is

251
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,816
expected basically so we tend not to

252
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:06,540
look at operanded evolutionary dynamics.

253
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,884
I would say that active inference has

254
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:13,964
some leverage to represent that that

255
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,572
other framework could not have because

256
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:20,108
of the relationship between constraints

257
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:23,824
as a clinical thing and beliefs as an

258
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:30,240
intentional statement.

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,476
Yeah. One thing that makes me think of

260
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:38,710
so when we're doing modeling based,

261
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,420
outcome based modeling whether for hobby

262
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,970
or for grad school, for job,

263
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,120
we're often in a setting that

264
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,504
either expects or rewards or accepts

265
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:59,630
only a converging answer.

266
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,288
Because it's being does insulin

267
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:08,724
in drosophila change their circadian

268
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:12,716
this or that? It's very converged

269
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,864
of a question already and it's something

270
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,096
where we're looking to reduce our

271
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:19,970
uncertainty about. So then that

272
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,996
closes off to the extent that it

273
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:27,700
converges it closes off divergent routes

274
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,696
not just of like doing and addressing

275
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:31,028
that question. That's more of a

276
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:34,120
methodological point. But then we don't

277
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,384
make models that can see

278
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:42,712
a more open ended horizon of what could

279
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:46,460
actually happen in the system because

280
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,052
that always adds more state

281
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:53,704
spaces that can be broken and unfolded.

282
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,944
So I guess again to the kind of kernel

283
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,850
of the question you've written these

284
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,484
very interesting sequence of papers

285
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:05,136
about symmetry breaking and all

286
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:09,344
of this. So how do you use that in

287
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,232
a way that goes beyond just stating

288
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:15,348
larger and larger state spaces or

289
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:18,964
feeling less and less confident when

290
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:21,076
it seems like a large piece of this is

291
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,804
that certain aspects of systems are

292
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:23,940
unprestatable.

293
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,680
Sorry, confident. But what precisely

294
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,160
unprestatable?

295
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,030
Unprestatable? Yes, I'm confident that

296
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,996
you cannot prestate the space of

297
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:42,076
possibilities or space of belief that an

298
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,716
agent can have and model upon an

299
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:47,292
evolution. Something that could like

300
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,610
that is by definition of the terms

301
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,976
something that could be argued is that

302
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:54,556
there is no such thing as a plane

303
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:58,304
devolution. But that

304
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:01,588
would be a very bold thing to claim and

305
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:05,124
most people would not say that

306
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:08,580
explicitly ever because it's

307
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,256
kind of obviously not the case. If there

308
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:15,290
is argument for it, I'd like to hear it.

309
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,304
But the argument that are

310
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:26,256
stated against the upper ended evolution

311
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:37,004
thing are basically,

312
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,728
you have, I would say, all rely on a

313
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,656
confusion between the fact that the law

314
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:45,584
of physics work, which they do, and the

315
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:48,464
idea that the specific language that

316
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:50,876
physics talks is a full and objective

317
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,656
representation of everything there is or

318
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,028
could be, which is like it's a

319
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:56,468
possibility we can discuss about it.

320
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,880
But this is a distinct possibility.

321
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,948
That the statement that the law of

322
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,270
physics work, which again they do.

323
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,896
Okay, cool. Well then just to sort

324
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:16,172
of close on this octave advantages many

325
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:19,356
interesting conceptual advantages, we

326
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:22,910
hope analytical and more

327
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,448
transdisciplinary or more holistically.

328
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:30,780
And also another huge piece is it's

329
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,800
connected to an always improving open

330
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,936
source computational environment? We

331
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,932
expect and prefer but in that case

332
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:45,428
linking a system in year X social

333
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:47,892
system or model. It's kind of like using

334
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:50,292
a Linux system that there could be some

335
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,704
developments like in message passing

336
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,672
algorithms or interoperability of

337
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,812
different generative models or category

338
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,556
theoretic augmentation of models

339
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:02,628
that are connected to the active

340
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:04,904
inference ontology all these different

341
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:07,356
kinds of synthetic technologies which we

342
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,116
can basically already imagine and to

343
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,700
some extent already have. It becomes

344
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,276
a way to map systems to a

345
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,576
lot. And that is not, as far as I

346
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:26,512
understand, possible without

347
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,928
kind of a first principles and

348
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,324
ecosystems of shared intelligence and

349
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,296
all these other kind of memes and themes

350
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,190
that we talk about all the time,

351
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,332
surprise, minimization things, doing as

352
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,116
most likely for them to do, paths of

353
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,760
least action, Bayesian mechanics.

354
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,020
Then there's a continuity of explanation

355
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,104
with the rock just being there and the

356
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:55,804
investor trading with this strategy, an

357
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:59,820
instrumental unifying account that

358
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,816
makes relatively minimal claims

359
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,676
about the territory that includes the

360
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:08,300
rock and the investing activity.

361
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,610
What did you add in.

362
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,940
What you said about message passing is

363
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,308
interesting to me because you have a

364
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,064
broad coalition of physicists,

365
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:23,836
mathematicians, social scientists,

366
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,264
people in academia who basically think

367
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,824
there is one language to nature and what

368
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:31,304
we do as scientists is to discover it.

369
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:34,424
And I do not think that holds water.

370
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,268
Not only because open evolution is a

371
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:39,112
thing which is a sufficient element

372
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,772
actually. But if you look at Mr.

373
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:43,944
Spacing, if you look at Quantum

374
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,704
Basinism, if you look at category

375
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,764
theory, open formally and conceptually

376
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:52,176
the possibilities that there are

377
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,512
different languages in the world and

378
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:58,732
they may be more or less interoperable

379
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:01,444
and they may be non reducible to each

380
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:05,332
other and then you start to ask

381
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:09,684
collision questions. I'd say especially

382
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:13,210
when implicitly or explicitly you are

383
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,216
interested in what determines the fact

384
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:18,136
that a specific language works in a

385
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:23,704
specific context. Why is not

386
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:26,332
going to go further down the math road.

387
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:26,990
But.

388
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,216
You have important compatibility,

389
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:38,320
interoperability result between major

390
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,320
fields of physics.

391
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,220
I will give a reference by John Bayes.

392
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,176
I don't know you pronounce it. I never

393
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,250
said this.

394
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,600
So we have important interoperability

395
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,756
results in fields of physics and

396
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:09,656
formal science and we

397
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:14,600
don't have a proof, however, that all

398
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,684
possible presentation of physics are

399
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:17,660
interoperable.

400
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,152
How do you say that? Interoperable,

401
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,264
interoperable, interoperable. Okay,

402
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,704
so they said it's wrong. No,

403
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,520
it's a great point. And what's really

404
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,000
interesting is like the relationship

405
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,828
between Bayes graphs.

406
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,870
First off, Bayes graphs being

407
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,484
analytically described and then

408
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:46,836
computationally implementable is on the

409
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,796
order of decades old. And then as we

410
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:52,216
kind of explored just yesterday in Live

411
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:56,536
Stream 55.0, the relationship

412
00:21:56,718 --> 00:22:00,164
between the Bayes graph and forney

413
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:03,448
graphs which enabled message passing to

414
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:05,736
be done procedurally to optimize a Bayes

415
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:08,044
graph which just brings all of these

416
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,312
computational, all these analytical

417
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,984
connections. But that wasn't understood

418
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,976
until it was and that was only slightly

419
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:19,490
over two decades ago. So then

420
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,320
in fact, those kinds of results and

421
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,036
developments reflect the

422
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:33,620
changing social and scientific niche.

423
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,348
So I don't know, maybe this is a

424
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,356
different question, but science as a

425
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:42,088
social activity and then I

426
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,280
don't know, how does that ground our

427
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,770
work or give us more? What.

428
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,530
So about

429
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,412
the whole language thing, I don't know

430
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,884
where it's at now, but at least ten

431
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,230
years ago it seemed that

432
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
you can have message passing.

433
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,144
You can have bias and coherence of state

434
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,284
of observable that does not rely

435
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:17,424
explicitly on the probabilities as

436
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,928
in a dispersion that is embedded in a

437
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,796
specific set space. You can have bias

438
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:23,296
and coherence that preexist to the

439
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,996
representation in which probability is

440
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:28,516
embedded. And if there was a way to

441
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,768
cross this and message passing, you'd

442
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,500
have a pretty straightforward

443
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,148
road to straighter

444
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:43,208
account of contextuality and social

445
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,128
construction. I said this with scare

446
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:49,192
quotes. Great note.

447
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:52,584
Exciting for quantum context and quantum

448
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:55,276
social and scripts and constraints and

449
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:58,144
norms. Let's close that question for

450
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,890
now, though. Nice. Okay.

451
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,318
How can yeah, great question. Thank you

452
00:24:08,324 --> 00:24:09,742
to whoever asked. And again, video

453
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,854
description. You can ask it'll appear

454
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:14,418
and we'll see if anyone writes more

455
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:16,530
questions during the stream.

456
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,566
How can or does a framework theory,

457
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:24,582
principle of everything articulate with

458
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,882
moral, normative, ethical,

459
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:29,110
deontic considerations?

460
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,254
So I think it is addressed in a

461
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,330
good amount of detail by an activist.

462
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,922
How you relate a theory of biological

463
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,550
individuation to a theory of ethics.

464
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,734
I do not have a good grip on this

465
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:58,834
literature, so I have high

466
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,002
level intuitive opinion on that.

467
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:04,500
But this is not like state of the art.

468
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,030
And okay,

469
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,302
basically I'd say this flows well

470
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:18,070
with stoic virtue etics.

471
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,410
Things act according to the nature. So

472
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,934
you may as well work so that your nature

473
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,650
is good. And then you have recursivity

474
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,134
in accounting what is good and what is

475
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:34,650
not. And I do not see straightforward

476
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,414
analytical way to resolve this

477
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,166
ambiguity. I said circularity or

478
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:40,720
ambiguity. Both apply.

479
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,834
Yeah. So I think Evan Thompson has

480
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:54,418
worked nuts and may have a

481
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:58,680
much better answer to how

482
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,146
we relate theories of being and theories

483
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:05,160
of physics. Oh, Varila did actually.

484
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,338
Yeah, I guess my sort of

485
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:16,300
short answer would there would be first

486
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,782
just we would have to hear a lot more

487
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:24,382
even possible perspectives, but without

488
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:26,494
even hearing them can at least maybe say

489
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:29,966
that there is an articulation and a

490
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,234
meter stick as an instrument. And this

491
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:34,722
kind of goes actually to that question

492
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:38,386
about the Bayes spaces and what

493
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:41,106
is preconditioned. So in what ways is

494
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:47,746
the meter stick articulate

495
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:51,314
with downstream ethical

496
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:54,406
frameworks? What ought to be done? Or

497
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:56,150
just normative more broadly,

498
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,818
there's downstream decisions that the

499
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:02,810
meter stick is agnostic too, and then

500
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,100
the meter stick is also a social result

501
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,338
that is itself downstream of other norms

502
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:14,810
and constraints, biotic abiotic

503
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,480
constraints, regularities of

504
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,680
space time.

505
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,434
I would say what

506
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:32,482
we can do with theory of sense making,

507
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:34,462
be it active inference or inactivism,

508
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:39,110
is to just describe

509
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,002
what we mean by normativity analytics?

510
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:43,874
What are the underlying natural

511
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:46,566
processes? When I say natural, I do not

512
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:48,282
mean by opposition to social. Those

513
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:51,258
processes are biological and social at

514
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:56,426
the same time. And that

515
00:27:56,528 --> 00:28:00,046
may bring reflexivity or distance to

516
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:03,354
account of normativity. That may prove

517
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:07,082
some of them incoherent or ill advised.

518
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:09,086
That will not give you a solution to

519
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,040
what is ethical and what is not,

520
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,082
notably. Because the most natural way

521
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:19,502
to derive ethics

522
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,874
from something like an activism or

523
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:24,034
something like active inference is that

524
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:26,818
both those framework are centered around

525
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:30,262
biological individuation. So we may say

526
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,614
that biological individuation is good.

527
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:35,574
Actually, that sounds sensible, but then

528
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:37,122
the question is biological individuation

529
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:40,266
for whom? Because you have a right, I

530
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:43,094
guess, or desire will at least to exist.

531
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:46,282
But soros cancer cells within your body,

532
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,226
who trumps who? I don't know. Not from a

533
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:50,480
purely sweetie account.

534
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,982
There is no way you can

535
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,286
straightforwardly, ambiguously derive a

536
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:59,390
prescriptive notion of good from any

537
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,886
physics, any descriptive account of the

538
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:05,540
world you will love

539
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,046
when you do, when you make nomadic

540
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,930
claims, you have goals because you are

541
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,518
linking and because of active inference

542
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:16,354
enactivists. We know that cognition is

543
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,360
embedded in no activity, in the

544
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,398
autonomy, in the biological activity of

545
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:24,118
the agent. So the theory that you are

546
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:26,774
framing is in some way motivated, even

547
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:29,626
if you don't know how or admit that it

548
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:33,082
is. And then I'd say from there

549
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:36,634
it does not quite destroy the project of

550
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:38,394
an objective system of ethics, but it

551
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,010
makes it much harder to refund.

552
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,134
So yeah, I'd say you can derive a lot of

553
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,562
negative results from descriptive theory

554
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:53,214
of like, I wouldn't say ethics because

555
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,170
ethics are non descriptive, but

556
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,666
descriptive theory of how ethics come to

557
00:29:57,688 --> 00:30:01,090
be. I would say that it is hard,

558
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,762
if not impossible, to derive positive

559
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:08,246
results if someone tried to do it.

560
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,520
I'd like to see what this is.

561
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,618
Wow. Thank you. Avil. That last piece

562
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:21,254
was very interesting. Many results,

563
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:25,450
many ant

564
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,980
colonies with their behavior to model

565
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,166
many real situations, to understand

566
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:33,680
social constraints and norms in

567
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,554
instrumentally with descriptions

568
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:42,106
that are then in the discussion section

569
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:45,918
of the paper. And the data are the

570
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,390
data and those are the descriptive

571
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,394
aspects. It's a different kind of data

572
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,714
in a slight way, but there's already

573
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,426
enough to describe and interpret from

574
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:55,958
what would be merely described. And it

575
00:30:55,964 --> 00:31:01,970
is very hard to derive positive results

576
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,054
first. It's a hard domain to make

577
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:06,678
positive results in not just ones that

578
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:07,974
make people feel good, but by positive,

579
00:31:08,022 --> 00:31:11,270
like positivism, like justified,

580
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,070
true assertions about a metaphysical

581
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,694
space. So it's hard to derive positive

582
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,546
results about normativity and the kind

583
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:22,286
of areas that this person asked. These

584
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:28,382
are all areas that are and

585
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,750
it's hard to use a quantitative theory,

586
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,098
which is almost it's an abstraction or

587
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:36,002
it's just one language. It's hard to use

588
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:40,210
that to make positive results

589
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,894
external to the system, harder to make

590
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:47,714
external to the system. Positive results

591
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:51,110
internal to the system are dime a dozen.

592
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,906
But then to really make that reflexive

593
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:57,980
loop that you described between

594
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,490
what is and what we expect and prefer,

595
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,514
which is actually woven up in an

596
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:11,470
interesting way in act INF rather

597
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,054
than two kind of diverge timelines like,

598
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:18,446
what we quote, expect to happen, like a

599
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:20,686
prediction of the, likeliest, future and

600
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,546
then a second timeline that's like,

601
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,674
well, what I would really prefer to be

602
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:28,562
doing in Actimp, the agent just has

603
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:32,930
one expectation preference which

604
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,480
loads up on the pragmatic value.

605
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,202
But that gives a unified approach

606
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,542
towards one's expectations of how things

607
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:46,534
will be and what they expect prefer them

608
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:47,320
to be.

609
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,276
I would say that at Vibe check level

610
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,516
active inference flows well with the

611
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:07,670
idea that empowerment is good actually

612
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,184
but make it a formal

613
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:15,430
relation would be quite hard.

614
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,784
You could say that inference vibes well

615
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:21,796
with the notion that everyone knowing

616
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:23,816
their place is good, which is quite the

617
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:27,176
opposite. So I don't

618
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,328
see an amigos relation between active

619
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:35,272
inference and any ethical

620
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:37,390
framework I can think of.

621
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,052
I would say again that it flows

622
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:46,012
well with virtue ethics framework

623
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:49,884
because of the relation between one's

624
00:33:49,932 --> 00:33:51,536
action and one's nature. According to

625
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:53,908
axio inference, nature being here in

626
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:57,364
Australia term, that is maybe not the

627
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,916
best term, but I'm literally using

628
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:04,788
production of before Christ text.

629
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:07,610
So yeah, nature is not that bad,

630
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,944
just not what we mean in

631
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:15,160
the context of 19th 20th discussions.

632
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,404
Yeah, that's a very complex topic with

633
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:25,772
definitely a lot of rich work on our

634
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:28,596
cities and people nature, our humans,

635
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:32,610
animals and that sort of

636
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,856
homo sapiens type discourse. And then

637
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,304
how does active inference frame the

638
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:43,764
relationship with the niche in

639
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:47,600
terms of entanglement or communication

640
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,740
or co action, intra action,

641
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,736
communication and influence through the

642
00:34:55,758 --> 00:34:59,784
blanket? Where does that go beyond just

643
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:03,192
describing? It doesn't have to.

644
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:06,228
I think a sort of base level in what you

645
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:10,040
referred to here is like that artifact.

646
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,636
The product of the work, which is what

647
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:16,376
the work is about, can be a jumping

648
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,840
off point for other directions.

649
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,124
And so the work of active inference

650
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:25,890
modeling can be in what it leads to.

651
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,984
It's not always internal

652
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:35,344
to the model that the improved

653
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:38,084
awareness or better decision is

654
00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:38,900
realized.

655
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,806
I can see one quite straightforward and

656
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:54,434
I don't think it is entirely broken

657
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:56,914
way to relate ethics to active inference

658
00:35:56,962 --> 00:36:04,166
is ethics like

659
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:06,342
not ethics normativity as a social

660
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:07,986
feminine is a collective phenomenon.

661
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:11,814
It's about social relationships. And you

662
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:15,670
could apply descriptive theory

663
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,658
of human behavior and like human social

664
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:23,580
aggregated collective behavior to

665
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,086
find out what traits in Australia are

666
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,734
prone to survival or adaptivity and

667
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:36,062
you could say that those traits are good

668
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:39,726
actually by construction of what we

669
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:41,826
mean by ethics. That could be Bayes

670
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:44,498
Coherence claim and then you could be

671
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:46,402
interested in what traits make

672
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:50,850
organization durable.

673
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,930
This is the only logically,

674
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,774
straightforward way I see. But that

675
00:36:56,812 --> 00:37:02,210
would tend to identify

676
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,094
as good things that I would not see as

677
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:08,346
good. Like feudalism. It lived quite

678
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:12,220
a long time. Well, feudalism, let us say

679
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,854
old school empires with no claimed

680
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,240
representations or power by the,

681
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,510
how do you say populace.

682
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:28,686
And you

683
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:32,174
could basically renormalize this theory

684
00:37:32,222 --> 00:37:35,620
not around clock time but around.

685
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,722
I. Don'T know, metric of lifetime, how

686
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:43,410
much things happen within organization.

687
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,150
And then you'd start having something

688
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,086
that is less obviously wrong. And you

689
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:56,246
could have basically ethics be about

690
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:58,714
optimization of specific parameters that

691
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,006
can be addressed by descriptive

692
00:38:00,038 --> 00:38:02,746
framework, but you'd have to make a lot

693
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:06,362
of jumps to get there. And while

694
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,620
I do not see an obvious problem to that,

695
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,274
it is very possible that we

696
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:15,402
would not like the conclusion of such

697
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:19,180
optimization thing. And again,

698
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,946
if you want to model something, you have

699
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,914
to decide what are the parameters of

700
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,794
interest and you can be wrong about

701
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:30,546
that. So here again, you do not have an

702
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:32,686
ambiguous even at a purely descriptive

703
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:33,930
level, you do not have an ambiguous

704
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,720
application of anything to anything.

705
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,184
Would say that more empowerment is good,

706
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:43,810
actually.

707
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,848
And I would say this goes at many nested

708
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:54,564
scales of organization and

709
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,836
I would say it has somehow something to

710
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,656
do to the physics of electrical

711
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:04,152
integration, but only

712
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,410
in a vibe check way.

713
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,250
Nothing wrong with that.

714
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,072
Yeah, especially with some of the recent

715
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:18,236
work like the variational synthesis with

716
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:21,836
eco evo devo and the connections between

717
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:25,864
the statistical concepts of persistence

718
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:29,040
or thinkness from free energy principle

719
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,396
related to remeasurement of the observer

720
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:34,912
or the organism of themselves. That

721
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:37,440
concept of repeated measurement being

722
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,100
compatible in our work and in other

723
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,140
related works. Basically with fitness,

724
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,156
if there's a height distribution of

725
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:49,060
trees in the forest and then a certain

726
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,864
time point later, the height

727
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:54,584
distribution is the same. That was

728
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:58,920
stabilizing dynamics.

729
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,336
We could say stabilizing evolution or

730
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,164
stabilizing selection. If it moved, it

731
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,604
moved. And so

732
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:12,024
how do since there is such a coupling

733
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:14,092
between things being as they are and

734
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:18,604
basically what the distribution

735
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,944
of what is there is described both this

736
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:22,736
stoic way but also this kind of

737
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:26,716
evolutionary biology way. So does active

738
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:30,836
inference offer any other

739
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:33,492
or complementary perspective other than

740
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:36,836
just the kind of strengths and

741
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:40,884
weaknesses of

742
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:42,100
using fitness,

743
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,224
phenotypic fitness or memetic fitness as

744
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:50,600
its own justification?

745
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,364
To say that is to say that something is

746
00:40:56,402 --> 00:40:59,116
good because it exists. This is not a

747
00:40:59,138 --> 00:41:02,924
strong position to take. So this is why

748
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:06,990
you'd have quite

749
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,636
high level of difficulty to derive

750
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:14,032
anything prescriptive from anything

751
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:16,656
descriptive. The function is not the

752
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:20,276
same. You can make relation between the

753
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:23,716
two. No, ethics is purely blind about

754
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:27,824
nature, of nature is purely

755
00:41:27,872 --> 00:41:32,180
ethically unmotivated.

756
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,304
But to have formulation between the two

757
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:38,264
is probably not possible, at least

758
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:39,560
highly nontrivial.

759
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,572
Okay, so to kind of close on this

760
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:50,012
question how does a free energy

761
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:53,310
principle as a principle for everything

762
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,296
and active inference as an implementable

763
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:58,272
framework for applying free energy

764
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:00,704
principle systems. How does that

765
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:07,148
articulate with these broader, very deep

766
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:10,360
and fundamental human social contexts?

767
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,248
Short answer seems to be it's

768
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:17,728
a lot like other scientific ideas,

769
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:21,796
inherits a lot of their challenges and

770
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:25,236
frictions and situations. Also there

771
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:27,764
appear to be some interesting promising

772
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:30,330
routes or themes to weave in.

773
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,608
However, even with a very charitable or

774
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:37,340
optimistic interpretation, there seems

775
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,924
some in principle challenges with

776
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:44,350
these areas that make

777
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,242
certain kinds of claims, perhaps not

778
00:42:51,296 --> 00:42:54,326
even within the proximate understanding

779
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:57,114
we have of active inference, but people

780
00:42:57,152 --> 00:42:59,194
should totally write in the live chat or

781
00:42:59,232 --> 00:43:00,886
add comments and stuff. I mean it's just

782
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,840
interesting question. Okay,

783
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,462
how are higher order beliefs about doing

784
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:23,822
better than expected at PEM? Probably

785
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:26,282
prediction error minimization integrated

786
00:43:26,346 --> 00:43:28,314
into the architecture of the agent's

787
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:31,842
internal model of external dynamics and

788
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:34,482
itself in those dynamics. My thought

789
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:36,626
here is that we have prior beliefs to

790
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:39,502
fulfill certain self evidencing

791
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:42,254
expectations, e. G homeostatic

792
00:43:42,302 --> 00:43:45,006
predictions. But how do those interact

793
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:46,834
with these higher order predictions

794
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:49,366
which appear to my mind to deny or

795
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:52,406
negate the fundamental priors insofar as

796
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:54,134
they predict the agent to go over and

797
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,406
above the levels of prediction error

798
00:43:56,438 --> 00:43:59,626
minimization which otherwise might be

799
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:01,366
achieved by fulfilling those fundamental

800
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:06,646
priors they

801
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:08,646
gave their thought? Let's return to the

802
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:09,880
original question.

803
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,980
I do not know like I know that

804
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,934
comparison to a baseline homeostatic

805
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:24,090
level of prediction arm innovation is

806
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,682
quite important thing in the shop

807
00:44:26,736 --> 00:44:28,426
psychiatry, possibly in the work of

808
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,786
park's homes. I do not know how that's

809
00:44:31,818 --> 00:44:33,674
implemented actually in computational

810
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:37,566
models. So I'd rather not

811
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:41,202
answer progressively. Ben White

812
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:42,994
should be more informed about these

813
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:46,530
things. Yeah. Or maybe you Daniel.

814
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,880
Well,

815
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,782
I mean the word that seems to be doing

816
00:44:53,836 --> 00:44:55,590
the work is integrated.

817
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,742
So higher beliefs about doing better

818
00:45:00,796 --> 00:45:02,998
than expected, prediction error

819
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:04,394
minimization or we can just say free

820
00:45:04,432 --> 00:45:06,762
energy minimization. So this was

821
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:12,540
explored in the active inference work.

822
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,520
So if the free energy

823
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,122
was decreasing as expected,

824
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,790
it was associated with neutral valence.

825
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,754
If things were improving better than

826
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,974
expected it was associated with positive

827
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:33,058
valence and if things were doing

828
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:37,114
worse than expected, it was negative

829
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:41,014
valence. So because of the

830
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:43,954
ability to make hierarchical active

831
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:47,394
models and just hierarchical

832
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:49,414
bayesian models in general, it is

833
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:51,414
possible to talk about these beliefs,

834
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:54,310
about beliefs, metacognitive beliefs.

835
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,974
So it is possible to make models

836
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:01,562
that have expectations about

837
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:03,726
how well even an optimization process is

838
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:05,082
going to go and then a computational

839
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:08,106
psychiatrist or whatever may associate

840
00:46:08,138 --> 00:46:09,390
that with the affect.

841
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,466
How is that integrated into the

842
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:17,166
agent's internal model of external

843
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:20,578
dynamics? Well, shortest answer is to

844
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:22,770
sketch it out how one sees it and then

845
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,450
it becomes either there or not. But just

846
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,320
in general, if the internal model

847
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,346
includes these higher order beliefs

848
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:35,270
about doing better than expected,

849
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,938
then that's the agent's generative model

850
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:43,434
that then interfaces or articulates with

851
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:44,810
external dynamics.

852
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,626
So you could have some environment that

853
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:52,810
has environmental regularity or

854
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,110
dynamics. Or that are influenceable or

855
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,782
not. And then you could deploy two

856
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:01,246
agents. One of them that has the

857
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:03,454
baseline generative model and the other

858
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:05,434
one has this doing better than expected

859
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:07,342
layer that the questioner is asking

860
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:09,614
about. And then they can do parameter

861
00:47:09,662 --> 00:47:12,034
sweeps and maybe adding this higher

862
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:14,658
order belief increases the state space a

863
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:15,778
lot and so it increases the

864
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:17,474
computational costs a lot, but some

865
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:19,334
interesting pockets of behavior are

866
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:22,514
found, or the behavior in that setting

867
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:24,678
ends up looking the exact same, but in

868
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:25,814
another setting it would have been

869
00:47:25,852 --> 00:47:30,438
different. A lot of these questions

870
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:34,630
point towards very important modeling

871
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,086
questions which can basically only be

872
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,406
pointed at because so much is going to

873
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:43,680
depend on what the actual model goal is.

874
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,830
Okay,

875
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,816
where can I find the recommended reading

876
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:04,660
list mentioned in the lectures?

877
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,540
You it's.

878
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,632
So where we have

879
00:48:22,706 --> 00:48:25,984
the slides from the

880
00:48:26,022 --> 00:48:30,220
lecture, they're in live streams.

881
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,288
Just go to the big table and find the

882
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:33,856
slides. If you find a lecture that

883
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,136
doesn't have slides, just let us know

884
00:48:35,158 --> 00:48:36,870
and we'll add it.

885
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,516
Where things were just mentioned

886
00:48:42,698 --> 00:48:45,348
in the lectures? That's a great

887
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:48,228
question. And our goal at the active

888
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:50,392
inference journal, beyond just

889
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:53,316
transcribing and publishing and adding

890
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:54,680
captions and translating and everything

891
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,224
of these live streams, we would like to

892
00:48:57,262 --> 00:49:00,990
also do more bibliographic work

893
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,796
so that the books that people mention we

894
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:07,720
can also have in that open source

895
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,644
versioned journal. So we

896
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,009
generate the first version of the

897
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:14,488
transcript, people update it and improve

898
00:49:14,504 --> 00:49:15,536
it. Oh, what was the name of that

899
00:49:15,558 --> 00:49:17,104
author? What book are they talking about

900
00:49:17,142 --> 00:49:19,328
here? And then we can actually have a

901
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:22,736
unified bibliography section for the

902
00:49:22,758 --> 00:49:25,344
stream. So if that sounds interesting to

903
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:28,340
you and you'd benefit from it, then

904
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,156
surely many, many others will too. So if

905
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:32,196
you're excited to see that kind of

906
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:35,712
active inference journal work, I highly

907
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:38,010
encourage recommend it.

908
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,210
Abel, what else will you add?

909
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,416
Same I can have nothing to add.

910
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:48,330
Yeah.

911
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,830
Okay, well,

912
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,604
we can look at some of the other

913
00:49:56,642 --> 00:49:58,590
questions that were added that others

914
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,644
wrote. People in live chat can add

915
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:05,040
question or they can go to the course

916
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:09,312
website and ask

917
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:10,290
a new question.

918
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,156
Do you want to look

919
00:50:19,178 --> 00:50:22,676
at one of the previous ones or do

920
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:24,196
you have any other just thoughts you

921
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:27,828
want to bring up? Not really.

922
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:30,100
The first ones were answered.

923
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,370
They were asked weeks ago. So there is a

924
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,944
relatively low likelihood that going

925
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:41,880
over them again would be very helpful.

926
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,460
I think we can cut the discussion.

927
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,428
Cool. But the important things that are

928
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:49,996
not treated now can be treated in

929
00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:53,776
conclusion anyway. Okay, so what are the

930
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:56,210
next steps then for the course?

931
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,632
Next step is, did a lot of people

932
00:50:59,686 --> 00:51:01,904
register for the presenting in the

933
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:03,200
conclusion session?

934
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,656
I haven't gotten any specific responses

935
00:51:08,688 --> 00:51:11,572
or like titles yet. Okay,

936
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:15,270
so we see if people do that.

937
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,170
Yeah, we can write another message,

938
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,512
including even a short video message or

939
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,640
just a written one. And then also ask

940
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:29,048
specific people also if anyone

941
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:30,988
is interested to present something, but

942
00:51:30,994 --> 00:51:32,892
they're not really sure the format or

943
00:51:33,026 --> 00:51:34,670
they want pre recorded.

944
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,332
We're just kind of exploring and seeing

945
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,588
what the people who are following along

946
00:51:40,674 --> 00:51:44,044
live want to do and also trying out

947
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:46,396
things that we think futures will want

948
00:51:46,418 --> 00:51:50,204
to do too. So if someone

949
00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:53,020
has an idea on that, we're definitely

950
00:51:53,090 --> 00:52:03,812
open to it. It any

951
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:04,820
last thoughts?

952
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,590
No, I am good. Cool. All right.

953
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,568
Thank you, then. See you, AVO.

954
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:16,448
Ciao.
