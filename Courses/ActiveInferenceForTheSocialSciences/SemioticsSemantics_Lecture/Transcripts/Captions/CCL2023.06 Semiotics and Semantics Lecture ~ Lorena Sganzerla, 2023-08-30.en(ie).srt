1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,080
thank you

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,840
all right hello and welcome everyone

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,519
this is the course active inference for

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,540
the social sciences in 2023. it's August

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,460
30th or maybe a different date depending

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,600
on where you are

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,300
and today we're in the semiotics and

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,180
semantics section we'll be hearing a

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,840
lecture from Lorena zakenzela and then

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,920
we're going to have a little bit of a

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,740
discussion so Lorena thank you a lot for

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,360
joining and off to you for the lecture

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,440
okay

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,300
hello everyone

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,780
um I'm based in Australia yeah I'm

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,480
Lorena I'm doing actually my PhD in

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,100
philosophy here

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm working cognitive sciences and

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,719
philosophy I work within from Concepts

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,780
or Innovations of information

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,360
so I'm very interested in

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,460
um foundational understanding of

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,620
cognitive sciences and information and

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,400
how this this kind of things cash out

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,740
and this is why I was interested in

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,939
talking about semantics and social

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,619
cognition

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,140
to see how these things cash out and

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,320
have a few ideas on how semiotics

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
can be compatible with like active

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,259
imprints and I try to organize a little

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,700
bit of this semiotic notion and active

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,280
inference to see if they pan out maybe

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,340
they don't so let's see how he goes

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,780
um

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,640
so let's talk about active inference

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
formal semantics and social cognition

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
foreign

39
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,540
okay I cannot move my slides now we can

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,860
so

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,500
I will first have a very short

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,079
introduction for you guys I have out

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,759
here so what you're going to do like we

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,500
have a short introduction I'm going to

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,899
talk a little bit of theories of meaning

46
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,280
and then we're gonna talk a little bit

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,079
the free energy principle and active

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,500
inference uh and how shared symbols and

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,379
social cognition can be thought together

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,319
I bring one case that I find interesting

51
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,840
and then we draw some conclusions

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,300
so let me know what you think in the

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,480
comments and after we can have a little

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,920
discussion or in the next session

55
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,859
so

56
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,840
your background introduction that I want

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,500
to first point to is we're talking about

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,560
biological agents and how they act so

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
we're always thinking in terms of

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,860
biological agents acting to express

61
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,959
uh you know that Express information or

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,060
sensitivities to context dependent

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,400
relevance to their environment and

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,500
things

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,519
uh that involve communities however how

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,280
this very minimal way of talking about

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,120
what motivates and what is relevant to

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,280
people becomes stable enough as a

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
self-sustaining pattern

70
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,340
of interactions like are they stable and

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,040
how they become that stable soon how can

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,319
those information sensitivities ground

73
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,680
values norms and goals like consistently

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
and over time

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,319
assuming that those values and goals are

76
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,260
necessary for Meaningful interactions so

77
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,900
we have two line motivations to behavior

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,739
right that's not really obvious and

79
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,959
ultimately how meaning is brought about

80
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,540
I don't think I'm gonna answer that but

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,760
I want to point to some directions and

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,580
how people have been thinking about

83
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,580
these questions over time

84
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,239
uh

85
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,879
so the problem of meaning has a brief

86
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,620
account right like traditionally

87
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,140
approaches of uh

88
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,319
to cognition localized meaning inside

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,459
individual organisms and more

90
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,040
specifically inside their minds so

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,860
meaning pertains to

92
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,260
a bit of content and this kind of things

93
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,920
so many have however like many have a

94
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,680
developmental history so it's hard to

95
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,199
catch those two things together if it's

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,380
inside people's minds how it can have an

97
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,380
evolutionary in developmental history

98
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,320
assuming that meanings are same things

99
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
that we can learn over time and they

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
happen in shared contexts they don't

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,360
happen out of nowhere in a vision from

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,699
nowhere

103
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,340
in a sense like we can say that it's not

104
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,699
really trivial the

105
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,440
conventionalized words

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,580
like for example meaning the

107
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,560
conventionalized meaning of a word for

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
instance cat means catch have

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,060
evolutionary history one thing does not

110
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,220
come from the other we need a better

111
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,979
understanding to Cache this meaning out

112
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,280
and that's where I'm stepping from like

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,340
that's my grounding like you need to

114
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,320
catch these things out in terms of

115
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,719
community of language users

116
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,919
which brings a problem right we have

117
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,320
goals and values that can be defined in

118
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,940
terms of those communities and you have

119
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,820
material and body factors so how these

120
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,479
two things are together or how how goals

121
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,860
and values affect and

122
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,259
motivate to material and envirage agents

123
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,400
to answer this kind of question like

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
over time there are a few

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
preferred ways like some I will do a

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,199
brief overview of some theories of

127
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,600
meaning they usually in terms of

128
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,639
cognitive sciences and any philosophy of

129
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,820
mind that's what I'm interested in how

130
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,759
they catch it out they usually try to

131
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,220
think of those things in terms of syntax

132
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,740
like concerns with form as an abstract

133
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,820
organizing kind of approval it's a type

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,080
of grammar and how uh at the order of

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,259
things and how The Logical

136
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:15,240
unfolding of those symbols how they

137
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,720
become meaningful and we but the syntax

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
itself is not really enough to cash out

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,580
meaning in semantics so then

140
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,039
in that since syntax evolve into a field

141
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,860
that we call semantics in which meaning

142
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,740
and mental constant are organized

143
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,919
throughout this

144
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
instructional syntax

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
then we have prepositional knowledge and

146
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,460
Truth conditions in which allows

147
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,880
these organizational story of meaningful

148
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,400
words to make sense and they're going to

149
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,680
point out into the into the outside

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
world

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,580
and I have a third option it's an it's

152
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,699
not so news well it's not so famous

153
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,580
which is semantics or more importantly I

154
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,699
will focus on bio semantics

155
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,160
uh they uses it concerns with the use of

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
symbols like

157
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,699
how they bring about meaning in terms of

158
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,340
pragmatics and that would be a little

159
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,680
bit different and we'll catch it out in

160
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,419
different terms

161
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,020
in relation to its peers like semantics

162
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,460
and syntax

163
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,740
well syntax is pretty clear in terms of

164
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,560
being rules right so what is semantics

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,080
talk about so talk about mental content

166
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,120
about intentionality about mental

167
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,460
representations in the sense we have

168
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,979
semantics that have a specific key

169
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,160
Concepts that reference truth conditions

170
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,919
and denotation so if you have mental

171
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,419
content and if you put these meanings

172
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,240
inside the organism it has to refer to

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,460
something else and how this cognitive

174
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,940
penetratory penetration happens like how

175
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,039
can meaning

176
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,099
come about Inside the Mind and how that

177
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,180
refers

178
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,940
to something outside in the world and

179
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,819
how this observational Viewpoint of you

180
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,979
thinking about something in front of you

181
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,860
can be actually true so we need we need

182
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,800
true conditions that denote these

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,900
specific relationship

184
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,780
and that is represented like in terms of

185
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,539
mental content

186
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,180
foreign

187
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,400
ly there's like very ways of catching

188
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,919
this out like uh it can that can be

189
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,319
functional that can be more an

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,800
internalized mental specific types of

191
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,419
representations grounded in vehicles

192
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,399
it's a very rich discussion and I don't

193
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,140
want to go into all that but just want

194
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,080
to point it out that science and

195
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,500
Neuroscience use those terms to study

196
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,040
and to build models that relates to

197
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,100
mental representations in terms of newer

198
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,380
representations because it kind of makes

199
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,480
sense for us like brain activity you can

200
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,040
see them in terms of what happens

201
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,380
by studying human beings and babysitting

202
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,120
animals and how this make the

203
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,700
representations really to something that

204
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,740
happens in the world you can see that

205
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,880
one Behavior elicits specific

206
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,700
activities and they have a correlational

207
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,860
uh relationship

208
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,820
and that is highly debated but there we

209
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,019
go we have

210
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,360
many types of Cashing Out newer

211
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,620
representations and concerning to this

212
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,260
relationship of stimuli and the

213
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,080
interpretation of the stimuli and how

214
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,019
they

215
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,440
motivate action

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,140
that's already a very much weaker claim

217
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,720
in relation to mental content and things

218
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,300
being inside organisms but it is to you

219
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,839
in the same line of reasoning

220
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,540
and there is also biosemite semiotics

221
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,060
which I want to focus a little bit more

222
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,580
because it comes in with the use and

223
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,680
interpretation of signs and symbols

224
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
which then also emphasizes like the

225
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,440
nature the embodied nature and the

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,019
situated nature of meaning so you don't

227
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,420
have meaning without those practices and

228
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,580
without the use of embodied agents

229
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,800
so we have to reject the idea that

230
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,899
meaning are abstract symbols or they

231
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,899
kind of be something that has to be in

232
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,519
your mind and refer to something outside

233
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,920
they're gonna only exist in this type of

234
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,839
relationship and they can take many

235
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,180
forms including chemical signal signals

236
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,260
like visual Clues Behavior words

237
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,980
like the word catch you can have

238
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,260
and how you organize it will get they

239
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,480
are all symbolic and that fits also in

240
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,220
that kind of structure

241
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,660
so they are very important for

242
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,320
communication obviously because we do

243
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,880
communicate in terms of pointing to the

244
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,000
same shared Notions of symbols in words

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and also other types of of symbolic

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,620
meaning

247
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,380
and we coordinate life around them so

248
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,360
living systems are then here

249
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,420
characterized by the semiotics

250
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,700
but the ability of creating and

251
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,680
interpreting and using these symbols in

252
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,019
terms of their practices the fathers

253
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,200
like of biosemiotics

254
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,500
and started like in

255
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,640
about probably in the 19th century

256
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,160
and Ox coal is one of the most famous

257
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,000
Representatives currently you can find

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,680
new

259
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,920
authors like Hoffman or

260
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,640
bigger

261
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,120
so I try to organize a little bit

262
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,180
in a specific model uh in a type of

263
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,480
model in a visual story how this uh two

264
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,120
types of understanding many are being

265
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,940
applied in terms of

266
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,980
series of reading

267
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,399
historically so even by semiotics we

268
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,899
have into pragmatics and you have the

269
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,300
practice and they relate to Dynamics and

270
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,240
context dependent so you can see here on

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,079
the top of the screen how agent we have

272
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,420
the agent relationship with its

273
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,360
psychological and social aspects and by

274
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,180
semiotics is somewhat concerned of how

275
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,459
correlation leads to prediction and

276
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,200
beliefs and that leads to expectations

277
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,220
and we also have other types of theories

278
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,279
likewise tele semantics and um

279
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,079
and theories of computational syntax

280
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,240
that tries to understand the Dynamics

281
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,660
and the mechanism of these uh

282
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,260
relationship

283
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,079
and they are not really Crossing each

284
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,560
other they are not in the same

285
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,120
they're not talking about the same

286
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,820
necessary things so how can these things

287
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,519
be brought together

288
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,180
that's when we I was thinking how can

289
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,100
bring this

290
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,019
free energy principle and active

291
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,399
inference in terms of those

292
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,500
relationships so well

293
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,139
different every principle and active

294
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,720
active influence as we know and I have

295
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,300
been talking about probably in the past

296
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,480
two classes they have it's a model that

297
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
is interesting for that because it has

298
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
like very minimal assumptions so it

299
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,139
starts off from the idea that organisms

300
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,720
act to maintain themselves in their

301
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,700
expected biological and cognitive States

302
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,519
so you're always talking you're you're

303
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,620
modeling and you're using this

304
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,680
mathematical to ground uh biological

305
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,040
agents in very embodied sense

306
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,040
and they do so by minimizing the free

307
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,139
energy right so they have these

308
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,120
metabolical states that have to be

309
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,279
minimized in terms of

310
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,100
expenditure in terms of uncertainty

311
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,600
given that

312
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,519
the long-term average of free energy is

313
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,380
entropy they want to minimize their

314
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,300
uncertainty in terms of their

315
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,100
metabolical states well that that

316
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,420
entails

317
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,339
that they have a specific range of

318
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,079
States they want to stay in like

319
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,420
minimally just stay alive to stay alive

320
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,880
you have to do a bunch of

321
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,940
things as a human being but every single

322
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,399
embodied agent would you prefer to stay

323
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,700
alive so there are some preferred basic

324
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,940
states that we've defined how action

325
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,800
will be take first to maintain it

326
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,019
metabolical states and how that

327
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,300
coordinates with the environment

328
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,920
which entities that

329
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,380
organisms and agents can be described in

330
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,620
in those terms like in active inference

331
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,420
tries to bring out those minimals

332
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,120
assumptions in mathematical terms that

333
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,940
try to express how reducing the

334
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,980
probability of these non-anticipated

335
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,500
states or States they are not favorable

336
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,079
to maintaining the minimum metabolical

337
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,820
needs

338
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,779
will be reduced right and that can be

339
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,579
catch the in terms of a generative model

340
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,579
as we've been saying throughout the best

341
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,820
actions how this genetic model set

342
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,220
specific times and organizes around

343
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,940
specific parameters that wants to they

344
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,720
can be described as trying to maintain

345
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,199
those parameters within reasonable uh

346
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,600
range

347
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,320
so by minimizing free energy on average

348
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,740
and over time this system will

349
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,839
self-organize so we'll bring out the

350
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,060
parameters of its internal states that

351
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,300
occupy a limited number of possible

352
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,959
State through set into a specific range

353
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,019
that will then be

354
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,240
then we'll be

355
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,120
used as somewhat could be in the guide

356
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,920
for this Behavior you have two kinds of

357
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,160
Dynamics happening here right that's

358
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
what I want to talk about a little bit

359
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,899
so we have then a phenotype that exists

360
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,699
in a specific type of States but that

361
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,860
will have to coordinate two different

362
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,660
kinds of Dynamics they're going to be

363
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,940
stated here as complement complementary

364
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,160
right you have both plates you have

365
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,680
belief updated so with Flow State you

366
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,959
have one type of modeling which is the

367
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,600
normal equilibrium steady states that is

368
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,699
intrinsic is named here intrinsic

369
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,560
information geometry and you have

370
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,720
believed updating that can be

371
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
can be treated as

372
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,160
extrinsic information on Geometry and

373
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,660
those are different

374
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,139
types of modeling

375
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,779
or the different types of thinking about

376
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,940
those processes that's most important

377
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,120
right so in terms of flow States

378
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,820
we can talk about uh dynamical system

379
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,940
and how you settle and self-organize

380
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,740
specific parameters and in terms of

381
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,420
failure updating we will be talking

382
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,679
about by Asian mathematics and by Asian

383
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,780
cognitive cognition and in in specific

384
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,400
ways of catching out

385
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,699
how an agent will change and behave over

386
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,020
time in relation to the Dynamics that

387
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,439
is set into place in this like State

388
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,059
space of possible actions

389
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,059
so while dynamical systems will explore

390
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,340
temporary contextual dependence between

391
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,700
environment and agent will set these

392
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,640
specific State space that has temporal

393
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,799
Dimension and has contextual Dimension

394
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,160
and once this state space is sort of

395
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,740
established we have more or less

396
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,880
uh it's a more

397
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
more or less

398
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
deterministic approach

399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,340
to what what can possibly unfold so how

400
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,580
changes changes in how Behavior

401
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,419
can be cashed out in terms of

402
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,340
non-deterministic behavior and that is

403
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,020
defined by the different type of

404
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,039
probabilistic

405
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,960
thinking

406
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,320
which is division mechanics of belief or

407
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,660
belief updating so we have then a

408
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,780
process of belief updating throughout

409
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,960
weighted interactions within this range

410
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,400
of

411
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,900
possible

412
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,980
States

413
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,039
so we do have Dynamics and we do also

414
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
have by Asian process

415
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,960
unfolding together in terms of

416
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,080
mechanisms

417
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,720
and with that we do have mathematical

418
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,880
statements providing a unifying

419
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,039
perspective on formal approaches

420
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,100
connecting behavior and Dynamics

421
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,160
so that's what active inference should

422
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,860
be bringing about as a novelty in

423
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,480
relation to other forms of understanding

424
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,820
organisms which can also can either cash

425
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,280
things out in terms of behavior or in

426
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,559
terms of Dynamics so trying to bring

427
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,120
these two things together is quite

428
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,940
interesting to understand how symbols

429
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,820
and what is semantics for instance

430
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
so that's what that's the question I

431
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,580
will be asking right now let's talk a

432
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,740
little bit about that

433
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm drawing here from a quite

434
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,480
interesting paper from

435
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,299
Maxwell hamster and initi politics

436
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,260
um

437
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,640
is in is free energy principle a

438
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,740
principle for formal semantics

439
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,440
so what what would be formal semantics

440
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,780
it sounds like

441
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,179
an oxymoron right like how semantics can

442
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,340
be formal how can you formalize it so

443
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,140
semantics the theory of meaningful

444
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,500
things so how can that be empty of

445
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,059
content

446
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,500
well

447
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,140
it has a few principles in which you can

448
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,559
explain what performance semantics

449
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,780
should how a formal semantics should be

450
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,039
understood

451
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,440
first off we have by Asian formalism

452
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,020
that does not necessarily have to commit

453
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,299
to classical Notions or representations

454
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,780
which are propositional in nature have

455
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,240
propositional semantic Concepts so the

456
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,340
idea is that you can

457
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,160
you can use the notion of representation

458
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,440
in a way that is not necessarily

459
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,140
contentful so how that's going to be

460
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,419
so under the free energy principle

461
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,419
representations can be formal that's the

462
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,320
argument

463
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,260
they are bringing under the physics of

464
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,380
uh flow specifically dynamical system

465
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,020
theories and information geometry you

466
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,140
can have this mathematical statements

467
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,340
that only represent possible uh

468
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,280
specific ways of interacting how these

469
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,520
correlations will affect each other in

470
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,460
over time in this variational phase type

471
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,240
of

472
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,120
Cashing Out mathematical uh functions

473
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,799
in the sense we can talk about

474
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,260
representation you know how we can be

475
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,539
understood under this formalism and what

476
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,400
they are saying is that they are best

477
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,440
understood as internal structures that

478
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,980
enable the system to parse out their

479
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,320
sensory sensitivities or the sensory

480
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,159
streams so to organize them in specific

481
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,440
parameters and also in terms of their

482
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,380
own Market of blankets and in their

483
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,280
blanket States

484
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,940
which is interesting here which is the

485
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,980
new novelty of this paper is that ground

486
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,200
in a mathematical model in these

487
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,020
mathematical properties of the system

488
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,100
will like avoid grounding these

489
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,380
properties in terms of the properties of

490
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,720
symbols and semantics in abstract or

491
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,539
subjective Notions of meaning but

492
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,059
impossible ranges of action

493
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,659
so summing up what we had before was a

494
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,179
type of computational model that had a

495
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,659
specific components that does not allow

496
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,059
for the intelligibility intelligibility

497
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,700
of cognitive component which is

498
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,100
intention which is motivation

499
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,700
context bring computer metaphors we have

500
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,220
neuro and cognitive activity often seen

501
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,919
as a transfer of symbolic information

502
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,580
and cognition then the snapshot of this

503
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,520
transfer so it's totally dependent of

504
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,220
that kind of symbolical transfer which

505
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,799
is really difficult to explain how

506
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,820
that's going to be biologically

507
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,159
plausible and there's a lot of effort

508
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,380
trying to do that so if you're

509
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,600
interested in this little there's a very

510
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,080
vast wealth of literature but they have

511
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,320
to answer to this problem so

512
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,900
cloud in my name brain needs to produce

513
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,480
an impromptu response to inputs of the

514
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,299
external environment all the time

515
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,760
and the idea of this formal semantics

516
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,460
the authors is trying to explain is

517
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,039
trying to include this component into

518
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,559
the model so you have a deflationary

519
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,799
model about content so you have a formal

520
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,360
semantics we have semantics without

521
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,840
content interestingly and formulated as

522
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
a variation of free

523
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,299
A variation free energy functional so

524
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,940
those structures

525
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,159
that embody those process correspond to

526
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,120
status states in the system name

527
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,760
and we also have the ecological

528
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
component

529
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,559
that can be

530
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,780
formalized in terms of these two

531
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,640
informational geometry that we

532
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,760
distribute densities do probabilistic

533
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,360
the density is one from the Dynamics and

534
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
one from the position describing

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
Behavior

536
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,100
and a lot so how can active influence be

537
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,500
compatible to biosynthetics can it be

538
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,480
actually compatible or is it even

539
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,020
necessary

540
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,360
well and

541
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,520
active inference is a very general

542
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,580
framework and then it does not really

543
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,559
give us

544
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,240
the tools to understand how encoding can

545
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,520
happen in terms of

546
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,200
symbols like how they can be

547
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,140
broadcasted into Collective action

548
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,120
because prediction alone does not

549
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,700
explain how do they come about so in

550
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,740
this sense

551
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,860
uh we do have meaningful correlations

552
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,820
that

553
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,159
refer to the Dynamics of one or two or

554
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,980
more systems in terms of information or

555
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,080
geometry

556
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,000
that needs to be cashed out with

557
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,200
predictive value so how is this

558
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,860
possible

559
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,220
well

560
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,900
we can talk about that in terms of

561
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,980
shared attention that's when one form of

562
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,779
these kind of model chip cache designs

563
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,360
so we have active inference capturing

564
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,400
relevance statistical relations between

565
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,059
environment and in aging and why

566
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,419
we uh why I'm trying to think about here

567
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,919
is how biosemiotics offer tools for this

568
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,600
informational sensitivities and in

569
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,659
statistical relations to catch symbols

570
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,720
in terms of use an interpretation

571
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,640
within communities of language users

572
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,179
about

573
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,559
and that can only happen in the sense

574
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,559
via directed action so the problem now

575
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,799
will turn you to how is it possible to

576
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,380
specify the factors that are sufficient

577
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,940
to constrain action and directed into

578
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,400
specific

579
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,520
um

580
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,539
about is European forestry I'm picking

581
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,840
this example from a very important like

582
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,740
a stage from chain disc

583
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,500
I really recommend kind of thing tells

584
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,220
the story about how coordinated action

585
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,039
how stage coordinates specific

586
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,080
Collective actions but that's not the

587
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,059
point that I want to talk here so

588
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,820
here let's unfold that a little bit in

589
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,679
terms of the design of scientific

590
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,779
forestry and think about scientific

591
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,940
forestry as a practice

592
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,700
and a practice that has an organizing

593
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,960
principle

594
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,059
that we will like

595
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,919
um well that will

596
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,520
be the main important uh articulating

597
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,000
story The can

598
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,020
connect together how agriculture layouts

599
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,299
plantations in specific ways and how

600
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,419
Collective Collective firms will make

601
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,120
specific choices in terms of this

602
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
organization and how Villages can

603
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,120
structure themselves around one specific

604
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,580
notion or one specific organizational

605
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,020
principle

606
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,860
and how everything can be calculated to

607
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,700
make

608
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,640
once one type of practice which is

609
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,140
agriculture is a very general more

610
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,260
legible and more manipulable

611
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,520
or

612
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,919
different kinds of communities so in

613
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,919
that we will involve manipulating the

614
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,640
very concrete aspects of the land the

615
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,059
terrain the products the workforce so it

616
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,520
has a very encompassing effect

617
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,380
over time and in a very concrete

618
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,380
in a very concrete sense

619
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,440
and interestingly when you talk about

620
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,400
European forestry and how how European

621
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,039
forestry was modeling the terrain and

622
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,620
how it's catching out value of these

623
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,960
terrains they were not trying to do that

624
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,140
to successfully depict the full range of

625
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,140
diversity of the actual social activity

626
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,500
and also the actual activity of

627
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,320
Agriculture or the richness of the

628
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,539
vegetation or they are not even trying

629
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,580
they didn't intend to do that that was

630
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,720
not the point of this kind of

631
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,000
modeling turned into a practice right

632
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,600
those models generally represent

633
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,720
specific slices of nature that were

634
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,240
interesting for one specific official

635
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,539
Observer and

636
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,779
that point is really important because

637
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,340
that we

638
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,179
came how all these communities and how

639
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,700
the terrain and how the forest we won't

640
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,200
fold over time

641
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,799
within this specific perspective

642
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,860
so I bring here a quote that I really

643
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,980
really like because it tries to flesh

644
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,980
this out in simple terms and very useful

645
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,720
ones

646
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,659
so thinking that exaggerating only

647
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,760
slightly

648
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,340
one might say that the interest in

649
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,440
forests

650
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,520
was resolved true when Fisco

651
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,039
specific single number which was the

652
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,279
revenue that you from the timber that

653
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,320
was extracted annually

654
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,779
well that's okay that's understandable

655
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,520
like that's intelligible and that

656
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,380
happens with you every day in terms of

657
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,740
how we understand our economy but what

658
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,140
is interesting about this quote is like

659
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,720
the best way to appreciate

660
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,059
how heroic was this constriction of

661
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,820
vision is to notice what Falls outside

662
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,340
the field of vision

663
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,460
so what is missing from that is not the

664
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,620
the organizational principle of Timber

665
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,980
being valuable but everything that was

666
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,919
not there or was being excluded treason

667
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,380
bushes and Planters implants that hold

668
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,559
little to non-potential for that purpose

669
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,840
so missing out of that is Florida

670
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,659
diversity foliage fruits

671
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,880
Etc twigs and branches missing out of

672
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,919
that are insects and small animals

673
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,559
depending on this diversity oh this

674
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,260
ecological organization falls out

675
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,799
of the organizational principle and that

676
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,899
has very complete consequences that we

677
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,299
still suffer and we still live we live

678
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,260
in the

679
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,480
height of this

680
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,039
uh

681
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,679
climate crisis that also starts from

682
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,559
this kind of thinking so it has really

683
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,679
very material consequences for us and

684
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,080
had for them at the time if you read

685
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,700
more about it you know that a team

686
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,039
whereby like ex by streaming and

687
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,740
domesticating nature so much like

688
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,840
decreased in quality and then eventually

689
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,299
decreased in value which prompted them

690
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,000
to re to try to reorganize that kind of

691
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,039
story

692
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,600
and what do I want to call attention

693
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
with the example is that also to bring

694
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,440
some specific ways of talking about it

695
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,500
this brings vocabulary for that only

696
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
exists in terms of this type of practice

697
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,059
specifically so this vocabulary

698
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,539
constrains nature in a way by pruning

699
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,620
what can your cannot be used so it

700
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,899
generates more than illegible nature but

701
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,659
a way of making nature intelligible and

702
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,399
intelligible in a very specific certain

703
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,059
way and we make that happen in terms of

704
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,659
symbolizing things in specific terms but

705
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,220
the symbols they don't exist in

706
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,000
themselves they exist only in

707
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,620
organizing this social practice around

708
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,980
them so when you replace nature with a

709
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,440
term called natural resources we are

710
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,919
doing exactly that it's specifying from

711
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,260
a generalized notion of nature

712
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,360
like flora and fauna becomes something

713
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,559
valuable becomes a commodity

714
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,919
but not everything right it trims

715
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,039
the practice it separates competing

716
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,100
species from value glands so plants are

717
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,200
symbolized as crops

718
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,020
and what is or the competing species are

719
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,640
symbolized the weeds they are not

720
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,740
necessarily crops or weeds or anything

721
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,380
like that in nature but area that for

722
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,260
the way we talk like that because we

723
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,640
practice

724
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,059
agriculture in a certain way that also

725
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,159
help that's the same for insects or

726
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,020
small animals that consume these

727
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,279
interesting crops

728
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,000
so

729
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,039
the material effect of that and how that

730
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,279
only gains protection in the practice

731
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,340
over time and how you have specific

732
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,320
intention that has unintended

733
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,000
consequences uh are necessarily here

734
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,779
situated contextualized and embodied in

735
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,519
terms of trimming specific types of

736
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,039
attention and this attention will only

737
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,399
shift to reach to try to repopulate

738
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,279
insect population for instance when you

739
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,480
realize

740
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,000
that this practice like brought this

741
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,640
specific effect in a certain way

742
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,700
that affects the value of our

743
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,960
understanding of nature

744
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,080
and that generates expect exactly a type

745
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,360
of social coherence and social

746
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,519
coordination and

747
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,519
how constraints create these coherence

748
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,880
right

749
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,220
well

750
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,399
now let's talk back again like cement

751
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,699
about formal semantics while while these

752
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,739
formal semantics and active influence

753
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,500
sort of embeds one type of mathematical

754
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,239
formalism

755
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,760
uh

756
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,440
symbols can only be grounded

757
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,800
in a specific concrete practices or in

758
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,820
action

759
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,339
so while active inference can be used as

760
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,159
a tool to explain social understanding

761
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,520
it it does do that in terms of

762
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,679
generalized synchronization okay in a

763
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,080
model of cognition that can be inactive

764
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,679
and dynamic but is it still very general

765
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,619
in terms of biosematics we can

766
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,159
think of it as a framework that might be

767
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,440
compact compatible with active imprints

768
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,020
in terms of explaining the materiality

769
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,660
of the environment in a non-reductive

770
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,060
and a non-reductionist way that tries to

771
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,880
retain some naturalistic credentials

772
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,180
so how that conventions are affecting

773
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,660
and effecting the invited agent in terms

774
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,720
of forming those singles and cashing out

775
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,399
those epistemic values

776
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,119
and

777
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,820
well social interaction in this sense is

778
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,720
not reduced to prediction because in

779
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,000
this sense the prediction will not be a

780
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,060
primitive but it would print but it

781
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,640
would be a result of a specific

782
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,380
participatory construction of the social

783
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,579
scene

784
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,640
over a specific

785
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,740
uh organizational principles and actions

786
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,540
that

787
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,339
through the general through the

788
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,800
synchronization of this generative

789
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,099
models or the synchronization of those

790
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,260
agents that can be described in terms of

791
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,720
those generative models gain predictive

792
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,119
value and when you model that then you

793
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,119
have this type of understand the value

794
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,480
of prediction in those senses

795
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,079
so

796
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,060
that allows

797
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,940
that allows us to say that social actors

798
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,240
in distance can behave as if they have a

799
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,660
generative model that synchronizes with

800
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,599
that symbolic State of Affairs allowing

801
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,040
them to understand each other's

802
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,320
behaviors

803
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,400
or to develop approximate sales

804
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,900
informational sensitive or

805
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,359
responsiveness to the same symbols and

806
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,380
goals

807
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,880
they are approximate because they're

808
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,560
obviously not going to be the same but

809
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,880
they have a

810
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,700
they have an the same approximate

811
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,079
orientation

812
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,980
so in this sense we don't have ever a

813
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,500
view from nowhere we don't have ever

814
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,140
this view that is only

815
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,839
cast out in terms of specific types of

816
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,599
minds but you also have types of Mind

817
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,280
shaped in terms of this

818
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,300
very concrete organizations

819
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,460
that happens in a community like for

820
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,260
humans at least it happens in community

821
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,660
of language and users so the

822
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,140
relationship with a symbolic cues

823
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,660
helps to select attention

824
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,540
at that specific time as well pruning

825
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,640
what is what should be ignored is

826
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,720
socially constructed environments so

827
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,260
within a specific community of language

828
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,020
users some types of actions will be

829
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,220
desirable and will be deemed as true in

830
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,700
that specific type of community and can

831
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,060
be only evaluated under those terms

832
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,300
so you can provide reasons for actions

833
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,200
in that specific

834
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,020
in that specific context context and you

835
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,020
can talk about how

836
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,980
rational that action is in terms of the

837
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,079
conditions set by those communities

838
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,060
in

839
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,520
and that brings us to the idea that

840
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,920
human cognition in this sense is never

841
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,140
decoupled from this cultural

842
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,380
Norms that like pushes and orients them

843
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,060
over time

844
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,339
so you know scale of behavior and that's

845
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,839
the interesting thing and that's why

846
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,940
active inference can be an interesting

847
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,040
tool to

848
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,140
model this type of human communities and

849
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,640
this type of behavior

850
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,040
because it can come from the very

851
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,000
Dynamics the very basic of Dynamics to

852
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,520
specific types of perception and scale

853
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,240
up and more

854
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,420
so when you have the problem of symbols

855
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,960
like in these two decoupled

856
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,579
possible

857
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,460
community of users and symbols and

858
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,560
embodied agents and things that do not

859
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,500
combine we can try to

860
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,619
model our agents in a way that we don't

861
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,119
have this problem anymore because you're

862
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,579
trying to include that very

863
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,580
that very

864
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:22,800
[Music]

865
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,480
um

866
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,280
component into the model

867
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,859
so in the sense we have active inference

868
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,380
used as tools to explain social

869
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,700
understanding

870
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,700
as generalized synchronization

871
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,220
and in understanding others

872
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,079
in that sense because of this

873
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,720
generalized synchronization model tennis

874
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,520
assumed by

875
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,660
those types of

876
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,480
organizational principles

877
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,940
we can also engage in terms of Niche

878
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,520
construction so we have more or less

879
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,460
deterministic way of understanding

880
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,900
um

881
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,960
the nature of singles because the more

882
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,260
we interact and approximate synchronized

883
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,420
with the environment we change the

884
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,520
environment that might changes back so

885
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,599
you have

886
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,480
an open system that is always an

887
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,640
everywhere situated

888
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,160
and he can be modeled then with this

889
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,619
type of predictive value

890
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,320
so

891
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,099
that's more or less what I had in mind

892
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,200
and that's how I was trying to think

893
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,839
about biosemiotics and in a possible

894
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,320
relationship with um

895
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,859
free energy principle and the formalisms

896
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,900
of active inference

897
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,380
and yeah I think this is it

898
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,020
awesome thank you Lorena

899
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,980
I'll just

900
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,420
organize things a little in my room but

901
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,880
thank you very much for this excellent

902
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,500
lecture

903
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
um just as a kind of warm up

904
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,980
how did you come to see it this way

905
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,200
what what brought you to this general

906
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,579
question of semantics and how do you see

907
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,280
that like on your own path and see what

908
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,480
what other

909
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,820
comparable or analogous approaches have

910
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,540
been done in terms of a meta-analysis

911
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,520
and proposal related to the

912
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,960
Naturalization of semantics

913
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,599
uh I think it's kind of hard to

914
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,339
naturalize semantics right I think

915
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,500
there's a lot of effort in doing that

916
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,660
and it might be that if you think

917
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,820
differently about how we naturalize

918
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,940
those values

919
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,820
we might have better answers instead of

920
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,260
trying to

921
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,720
instead of trying to fit

922
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,480
gauge and into the model we try to fit

923
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,099
the model into the agent right I think

924
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,440
that's the move I think that was the

925
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,960
motivation I think the interesting the

926
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,240
interesting part of biosomatics in that

927
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,300
sense it tries to make less assumptions

928
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,820
when you're we will start from a

929
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,140
hardcore

930
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,720
assumption or model assumption right

931
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,220
that semantics is within only within the

932
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,560
mind then we have a very hard time

933
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,740
trying to explain that if you assume

934
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,320
less about that you might bring

935
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,000
different types of explanations of

936
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,079
course

937
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,780
but they might be very they'd be more

938
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,520
interesting that I was trying to like

939
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,800
see how that actually

940
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,440
how that looks like when you you bring

941
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,599
these two things together in in the

942
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,540
terms of active inference and free

943
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,760
energy principle if that works if that

944
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,079
is possible

945
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,700
I don't know if that answers your

946
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,939
question

947
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,960
so wondering about that fundamental

948
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,880
question and then coming across active

949
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,859
inference or how

950
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,960
elsewhere have people brought in the

951
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,480
more formal and Technical

952
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,680
into this question

953
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,300
um

954
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,359
what do you mean by Mar like formal and

955
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,859
can you repeat that please yeah how does

956
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,900
active inference help us or have

957
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,339
continuity or difference with previous

958
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,140
ways that people

959
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,280
have connected the technical part from

960
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,520
the um yeah what you described as the

961
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,440
formal semantics embeds the mathematical

962
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,480
formalism and then the symbols are

963
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,420
grounded in specific action so has that

964
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,819
been played out in other technical

965
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,380
Frameworks

966
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,540
well we do have technical Frameworks

967
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,980
that try to organize that in developing

968
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,200
activism right and auto poetic and

969
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,020
activism but then we just have in these

970
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,380
terms the notion of symbols uh sometimes

971
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,119
get

972
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,220
get Loosely described and I think these

973
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,020
guys are not really interested in that I

974
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,980
think they're trying to describe

975
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,440
something else for example or you can

976
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,940
have some specific types of

977
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,780
computational that like if you if you

978
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,640
really buy into the mind the

979
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,200
computational

980
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,960
brain and Temptation mind metaphor

981
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,900
then you have a hard time also to

982
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,780
explain how semantics are built in into

983
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,300
that computation right

984
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,700
I don't think anyone has a very strong

985
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,680
answer to that you have to really buy

986
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,260
into the idea of information processing

987
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,180
and that's something that that's what

988
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,640
brought me a little bit to that thing if

989
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,200
you buy into the metaphor of information

990
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,359
processing then you need to have

991
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,900
semantics within the brain if you try to

992
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,180
lose a little bit this notion if you try

993
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,880
to understand process and information in

994
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,400
different terms what happens

995
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,079
I think that was more or less the

996
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,940
question that I was trying to ask

997
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,520
an effective influence and by

998
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,660
semiotics can because they have less

999
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,960
assumptions in terms of what happens

1000
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,839
inside the processing information

1001
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,760
content in the mind

1002
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,640
if that can if can if that can bring

1003
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,540
interesting like answers or if you can

1004
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,220
use as a model to organize Behavior

1005
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,020
and

1006
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,180
and there's another point that also

1007
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,119
brought me a uh to

1008
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,579
this type of thinking was

1009
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,460
trying to understand

1010
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,859
how active active inference can include

1011
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:44,520
his historicity of the agent right

1012
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,140
because I think that something comes

1013
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,960
across

1014
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,359
debated in active influence how you

1015
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,520
bring novelty into the state space like

1016
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,380
once you define that state space the

1017
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,640
state space is more or less

1018
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,500
deterministic

1019
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,240
because everything will happen within

1020
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,920
that specific range so how does an

1021
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,380
object comes within

1022
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,280
this type of uh modeling

1023
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,859
so how can you explain that

1024
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,079
if if it does I don't know it's more

1025
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,160
like

1026
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,140
it's it's more like an exploratory

1027
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,000
question that I was trying to make and

1028
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,819
see how that pans out I don't I actually

1029
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:25,220
also don't have an answer for that but

1030
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,319
if you take seriously this uh some more

1031
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,300
inactive claims that you need history of

1032
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,660
interactions to to understand how agents

1033
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,420
behave you cannot understand agents

1034
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,000
without that so

1035
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,700
how does active inferences these

1036
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,280
questions specifically

1037
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,000
right because once yeah that system I

1038
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,640
think that is still kind of debated I'm

1039
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,220
not sure if there's new developments in

1040
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,220
this specific topic but I remember I

1041
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,280
think two years ago was like this

1042
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,099
specific papers from the Paulo I think

1043
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,859
the 4K laying down a path is

1044
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:06,839
specifically focusing on that in the

1045
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,720
formalisms and Etc so I don't know if

1046
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,640
these two things can

1047
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,099
bring a little bit of more

1048
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:18,079
to the conversation maybe not

1049
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,119
this great I'll just ask some some more

1050
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,099
general questions you're adding a lot

1051
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,800
with these thoughts so you said the

1052
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,260
social interaction in this account is

1053
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,020
not reduced to prediction

1054
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,380
so how would you unpack that

1055
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,540
and how would you relate this

1056
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,859
I don't know exactly what term of art

1057
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,420
would go here but this kind of social

1058
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,060
epistemology that active inference

1059
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,460
provides Us in contrast to say

1060
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,680
predictive processing

1061
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,900
so how is it that that we would or

1062
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,640
wouldn't reduce something to prediction

1063
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,680
and then what is it that active

1064
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,520
inference brings into that discussion

1065
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,839
yeah

1066
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,220
oh I think I have two points in that

1067
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,720
like active interest in that sense that

1068
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,680
has like

1069
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,480
out type of modeling that tries to

1070
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,240
include all the time and everywhere the

1071
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,819
embodied agent like if if you take

1072
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,339
seriously the idea then the model

1073
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:18,660
the genetic model is always accurately

1074
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,400
modeling

1075
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,240
that specific agent and because you can

1076
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,040
it cannot be true or false that the

1077
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,500
model is your current state like is like

1078
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,079
that like even if you are not feeling

1079
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:32,760
really well you just know that you're

1080
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,020
not feeling well in relation to

1081
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,240
something else and that

1082
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,079
that story is still very accurate to

1083
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,839
your stage condition right now

1084
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:46,380
right so the prediction

1085
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,839
you get instruction in socially at least

1086
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,300
in that sense not in the specific detail

1087
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,700
of like predictive predictive processing

1088
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,380
you think because I think that's more

1089
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,359
complicated but socially in social

1090
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,859
cognition at least

1091
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,599
we can talk about this predictive value

1092
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,400
I think it's a more interesting way to

1093
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,780
do that because

1094
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,520
the mother the the example that I use in

1095
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,980
terms of Cashing Out symbols we are

1096
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,020
we're using some something that was

1097
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,180
meant in

1098
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,579
to make something intelligible that have

1099
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,819
very bad consequences that were not even

1100
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,859
close to be predicted

1101
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,200
so in that sense and how these

1102
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,819
consequences happen

1103
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,680
don't prediction cannot be there

1104
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,140
everywhere and all the time

1105
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,640
the prediction in this has an

1106
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,980
orientation as well right

1107
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,319
so that gonna that's gonna unfold only

1108
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,060
in terms of the orientation but that's

1109
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,880
not all-encompassing

1110
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,060
so well what does that say about the

1111
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,440
prediction that's why I was trying to

1112
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,540
think of it as not being a primitive but

1113
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,760
something that comes along with this

1114
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,300
Dynamics

1115
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,480
but yeah

1116
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,300
well this is a very deep impression

1117
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,660
point that because the causal structure

1118
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,839
of the world changes historiosity agents

1119
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,339
change they learn

1120
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,740
and they attend and then the niche

1121
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,359
changes with stigma G and Niche

1122
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,819
modification so because things really do

1123
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:16,980
change Through Time

1124
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,000
then just training a data set at one

1125
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,440
time point

1126
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,440
and then using that same generative

1127
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,500
model and carrying it forward

1128
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,380
it's like picking a speed in a direction

1129
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,720
when you're on a Winding Road and just

1130
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,980
saying all right now let's turn on

1131
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,900
cruise control right now and just keep

1132
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,160
going in this direction it's working

1133
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,960
right now

1134
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,500
um so then to connect that to the

1135
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,560
legibility of the forests as the causal

1136
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,900
model changed and externalities were not

1137
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,579
taken into accountants and so on all

1138
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,380
these different features you brought in

1139
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,040
so now is active inference and cognitive

1140
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,700
modeling cognitive Technologies

1141
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,500
increasing our legibility

1142
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,980
of perception cognition and action

1143
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,960
through surveillance technology and

1144
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,940
other mechanisms

1145
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,000
such that there could be

1146
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,500
slash we expect there to be

1147
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,460
also

1148
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,780
hidden Dynamics and externalities that

1149
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,800
we are also failing to see when we make

1150
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,900
some aspects of cognitive systems

1151
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,099
legible

1152
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:30,960
in the way that research in the

1153
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,700
neurosciences is happening towards

1154
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,839
yeah I think in the sense like if you

1155
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,240
've got focuses everything right it

1156
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,980
would be non-informative

1157
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,140
in terms of what you do when you do that

1158
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,300
you have one interested you're

1159
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,220
interested in something right you have

1160
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,720
one

1161
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,760
thing in mind when you get your trying

1162
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,500
to flesh out

1163
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,359
in terms of cognitive modeling how that

1164
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,480
so how that applies to these more own

1165
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,339
compassing situations I think that's

1166
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,740
like that model is how I'm trying to ask

1167
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,020
this question so you can model them in

1168
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,700
dislike sliced

1169
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,099
sense and that's

1170
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,619
that's what we that's what we do as

1171
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,660
scientists and that's how we learn about

1172
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,680
things

1173
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,880
but that only way of seeing that that

1174
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,740
very specific model does not all

1175
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,839
encompassing for Owens or it's like so

1176
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:26,099
how can you

1177
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,940
how can you use that in comparison to

1178
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,440
other situations so how can you

1179
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,420
integrate this this type of thing I

1180
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,040
don't know I really

1181
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,079
I I don't have a question for an answer

1182
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,599
for that I don't know if we do have an

1183
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,160
answer for this

1184
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,380
this type of

1185
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,079
question currently but I think it's a

1186
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,180
very valid question to ask

1187
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,599
because because also in terms of

1188
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,920
sometimes

1189
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,920
applying that socially

1190
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,740
that sort of revise in a way

1191
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,780
and then it becomes someone organizing

1192
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,660
principle that becomes somewhat reified

1193
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,160
so keep an eye for this kind of

1194
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,900
metaphorical use like assuming a little

1195
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,780
bit that all this talk can be

1196
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,420
metaphorical and it can be interesting

1197
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,579
and useful to catch that catch them out

1198
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:18,660
in these terms because they don't have

1199
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,599
other ways to talk about them

1200
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,400
so

1201
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,579
how we don't reify them and how they are

1202
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,119
in you know because

1203
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,579
well I think I'm I'm getting I'm having

1204
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,260
a hard time to get there but I think I

1205
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,460
think I'm making the point of people

1206
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,460
criticizing the cause of Primacy so you

1207
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,579
when you reduce this complex systems to

1208
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,160
one single cause cashing out everything

1209
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,619
that organizes the principle this this

1210
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:49,440
these complex systems and when Primal

1211
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,420
cause

1212
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,819
then you are losing the complexity

1213
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:56,280
however if you don't do that

1214
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,460
how can you slice it out you understand

1215
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,800
the system so I think that's the two

1216
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,760
tensions here that I'm kind of trying to

1217
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,180
to to propose as a question in terms

1218
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,760
instead of an insert

1219
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,800
I don't know if that makes sense but I

1220
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,440
think yeah I hope people continue that

1221
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,480
discussion I'm going to build on that

1222
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,119
just to kind of maybe circle around that

1223
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,579
because it's really important so in the

1224
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:25,740
forestry case

1225
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,700
the the realist perspective again using

1226
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,760
retro casting the way we or contemporary

1227
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,260
discussions some of them in the active

1228
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,339
inference and free energy principal

1229
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:39,300
space are the realist says that region

1230
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,440
of land is just economic potential it is

1231
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,599
a natural resource that becomes a kind

1232
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,920
of handle

1233
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,260
the instrumentalist perspective takes a

1234
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,240
step back and says it's as if that piece

1235
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,900
of land is a natural resource so yeah

1236
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,000
the territory is Indescribable and

1237
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,099
there's still a space for mystery but

1238
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:02,160
then when the proxies come out because

1239
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,760
policies are being selected that as if

1240
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,940
in some ways carries similar

1241
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,540
consequences to the actual because they

1242
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,040
and they may totally agree and the

1243
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,180
realists and the and the

1244
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,520
instrumentalists might be like yeah it

1245
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,319
is an economic potential or represents

1246
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,819
or it could be treated as such or it

1247
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,040
could be engaged with as such like that

1248
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,980
cognitive diversity can align on the

1249
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,200
social policy

1250
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,720
that then connects to these broader

1251
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,940
social

1252
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,579
questions and histories and so it's kind

1253
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,740
of interesting like what work does this

1254
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,720
instrumentalism do like oh it's just a

1255
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,400
principle

1256
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,040
what work does it do and what doesn't it

1257
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,980
do and the ways that that science and

1258
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,040
technical engineering fields are and

1259
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,400
aren't deployed alone or together

1260
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,339
with other considerations

1261
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:59,160
yeah that's very interesting like in the

1262
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,260
sense either if you're realist or

1263
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,180
instrumentalist about that like if you

1264
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,160
think like models are not either true or

1265
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,660
false they're just models right they

1266
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,760
might have views and you might they

1267
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:14,160
might be capturing real properties but

1268
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,260
the problem is in this conversation even

1269
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,059
when you push them like you have

1270
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:19,859
realized and have an instrumentalists

1271
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,900
try to like loosen up a little bit these

1272
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,280
assumptions

1273
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
they still come they still not refine

1274
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,319
those principles and taking them to be

1275
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,240
more or less true or false

1276
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,700
right well that's kind of plot twist

1277
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,400
it's like you're appealing to what

1278
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,079
surprise minimization as unifying

1279
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,240
the diversity responses that the realist

1280
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,740
and instrumentalists do so then does

1281
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,500
that make surprise or cognitive inertia

1282
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,339
like the ER principle where the maze

1283
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:54,900
just ends and it explains itself or how

1284
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,119
does that play in a pluralistic

1285
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,240
scientific setting

1286
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,059
yeah that's that that's you you you

1287
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:05,520
might you can have a third answer to

1288
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,180
that like right it has two

1289
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,040
well I think the answer that I'm trying

1290
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,200
to give is more eliminativist in the

1291
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,640
sense that eliminates the cause of

1292
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,119
Primacy of them of these two modes of

1293
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,500
answering

1294
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,000
so

1295
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,920
when you think I'm thinking I have in

1296
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,260
mind now like actually just to try to

1297
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,880
make sense of that when you when you

1298
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,859
think about biological information you

1299
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:30,240
can think about biological information

1300
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,859
has been where you were as being

1301
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:35,160
metaphorical or instrumental or you have

1302
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,760
these guys like Susan oyama or Richard

1303
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,760
Levant in Detroit to bring some they are

1304
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,440
against this cause of Primacy they try

1305
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,900
to advocate for

1306
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,839
systems that do have that but they have

1307
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:51,000
like a lot of more going on so that

1308
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,640
cannot be the only answer because those

1309
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,980
systems is not everywhere

1310
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,559
scientifically cash they don't have to

1311
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,240
be everywhere

1312
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,099
that so

1313
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,319
for example going back to to the

1314
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,900
forestry forestry so the realistic is

1315
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,839
going to say that territory is valued

1316
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:15,780
properly and the the

1317
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,059
in the sense the instrumentalisticated

1318
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:21,599
look as if you know can be he is as if

1319
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,180
but it's not necessarily value property

1320
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,300
it doesn't matter you can say like well

1321
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,640
this terrain is

1322
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,220
theme from one perspective as value

1323
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,200
property but this also has other uses

1324
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,940
around them so you had to be more

1325
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,140
inclusive of this diversity because

1326
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,059
this the only organization

1327
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,220
principle around that specific terrain

1328
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,079
is not

1329
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,040
only to generate value or if it does

1330
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,960
this value doesn't have one single

1331
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,660
output it can have more than one output

1332
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,940
in terms of

1333
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,980
very specific terms you can catch it out

1334
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,020
very maturely this terrain that has to

1335
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,640
provide monoculture needs to also has to

1336
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,280
provide also value for the diversity of

1337
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,020
the fauna and the diversity the

1338
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,359
diversity of the Flora around it and

1339
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,280
that is not included in a model because

1340
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,079
that's not what a model is done for the

1341
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,740
model has a specific use and that's fine

1342
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,440
however that does not reduce the terrain

1343
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,059
to that

1344
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,339
and well when you're talking about

1345
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:28,520
cognition that might be more complicated

1346
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,640
but I think it's easy it's an easy way

1347
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,740
to talk about this causal Primacy when

1348
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,400
you talk about uh forestry because we

1349
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,579
are very much now experiencing this

1350
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,200
climate crisis and we see these things

1351
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,780
happening right now and how difficult

1352
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,940
because this this type of thinking is

1353
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,640
built over time in so well

1354
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,900
fixed in the way we see things and we

1355
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,579
are understanding how hard is to change

1356
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:00,000
that it's not it's a it's a paradigm

1357
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,220
shift that needs to happen for that to

1358
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,240
change

1359
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,180
is not necessarily the model that is

1360
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,640
right or wrong it's just how you

1361
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,900
understand and apply them

1362
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,200
so

1363
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,119
there are pragmatics into that it's not

1364
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,500
only an instrumental but it has

1365
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,500
something that the instrumentalists take

1366
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,020
does not capture and I don't know how to

1367
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,839
cast it out in a one single word but

1368
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:27,000
that's what biosematics was offering by

1369
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,460
semiatics was offering the idea of

1370
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,160
practice in pragmatics I don't know if

1371
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,119
it's

1372
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,339
the whole story but it's another

1373
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,640
Point into that story

1374
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,280
a lot a lot of great points all all

1375
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,880
connect that no of pragmatism to a

1376
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,380
little bit of the active inference

1377
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,500
formalism so when it comes to policy

1378
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,680
selection Behavior selection some but

1379
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,380
not all cognitive entities can act as if

1380
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,599
they're calculating expected free energy

1381
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,359
so these are the active the truly active

1382
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:02,040
entities whether they're simple or

1383
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,540
whether they're sophisticated they do

1384
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,819
planning expected free energy is how

1385
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:08,880
those agents are being modeled as if

1386
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,579
they're making decisions and it consists

1387
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:13,559
of the pragmatic and the epistemic value

1388
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,180
that's how these different policies are

1389
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,900
evaluated and so I see two

1390
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,460
angles or windows that that supports

1391
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,460
at least for my non social sciences

1392
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,220
background a new kind of meeting in the

1393
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,240
middle there

1394
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,180
so first is the expansion of pragmatic

1395
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,880
value under the principle that surprise

1396
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,040
minimization or bounding is the

1397
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,180
imperative

1398
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,460
right there in the pragmatic value it

1399
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,119
doesn't have to be just body temperature

1400
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,819
or financial income we can expect and

1401
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,140
prefer

1402
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,480
ourselves to be learning new things or

1403
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,059
meeting new people and so we can load

1404
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:56,760
into the pragmatism

1405
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,359
different goals that under a narrower

1406
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:03,540
definition of utility or pragma have not

1407
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,920
traditionally been included so I think

1408
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,900
that first way

1409
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,680
is it speaks to a more inclusive concept

1410
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,020
of utility you might say I'm also

1411
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,079
de-risking on forest fires alongside the

1412
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,700
Timber and already you've had you have

1413
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,700
now plural pragma so I think that's the

1414
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,819
kind of crossover and then the deeper

1415
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,140
and second and not saying there's only

1416
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,760
two ways that that the conversation

1417
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,400
continues we have epistemic utility

1418
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,680
in terms of epistemic value

1419
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,559
and so the balance and the weighting

1420
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,440
between pragmatic value and epistemic or

1421
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,740
learning oriented activity overall

1422
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,260
helps control

1423
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,819
a dynamic balance with just like how

1424
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:50,160
tight is the grip and the preference

1425
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,900
overall

1426
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,160
and maybe we have uh some preference for

1427
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,799
Timber to be exported from a region

1428
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,599
but we really don't know we don't have

1429
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,280
long-term modeling we don't have deep

1430
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,500
causal analysis and so we're going to

1431
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,260
put five percent on the pragmatic

1432
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,260
extraction and other pragmatic features

1433
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,460
and leave the rest of the policy in an

1434
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,280
exploratory mode

1435
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,160
and come to a blend that's not just on

1436
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,619
the the Spectrum from explore to exploit

1437
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,180
which is how this has been approached in

1438
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,119
like cognitive Sciences previously it's

1439
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,460
like this is the third thing where

1440
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,319
policies that are on the frontier of

1441
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:33,299
exploring and exploiting

1442
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:35,160
rise to the top through their

1443
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,079
contributions to pragmatic and epistemic

1444
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,299
value and we made the model

1445
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:42,540
so that isn't to say that that is what's

1446
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,099
happening on the ground or maybe that's

1447
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:47,420
just the instrumentalist perspective

1448
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:49,740
yeah yeah

1449
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:53,280
but if if it's an instrument an

1450
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,380
instrumentless perspective might be a

1451
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,780
good one right in the sense the idea of

1452
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,140
inclusion is kind of the interesting one

1453
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,700
right because if you really find a

1454
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,740
destination of maximization because you

1455
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,780
can use that in certain ways to

1456
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,359
understand what happens within when

1457
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,760
you're modeling something what is the

1458
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,000
limit of that maximization so that's you

1459
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,400
can model agents as if maximizing

1460
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,440
utility for instance

1461
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,960
for maximizing utility is something that

1462
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,980
needs to be balanced out with utility of

1463
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,380
everyone around them right

1464
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,960
and that's not that's not trivial how

1465
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,660
that happens right and even if it does

1466
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,780
and even if it were trivial it's not

1467
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,819
something that

1468
01:04:38,819 --> 01:04:42,079
Maps out completely

1469
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,059
identically with all every single agent

1470
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:46,920
they don't that's not that's not going

1471
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,000
to be there's going to be diversity

1472
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,359
there so how do you make that notion

1473
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,020
more inclusive and less verified in that

1474
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,240
sense because then if the more you

1475
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,160
refine the more you single it out into

1476
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,099
around only

1477
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:05,280
one General type of understanding so

1478
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,500
when you think them more individually

1479
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,880
then you kind of lose you lose that

1480
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,980
strength of this one single

1481
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,660
principle

1482
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,000
organized like the one single way of

1483
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,680
Cashing Out fertility that's not the

1484
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,260
principle right sorry

1485
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,299
so I think that's like speaks a lot of

1486
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:25,319
lightning

1487
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:27,440
the type of

1488
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,880
instrumental use and the type of

1489
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,799
pragmatism and how

1490
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,260
the time the types of application of

1491
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,579
this

1492
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:38,520
practices right remember in the in the

1493
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,359
sense

1494
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,880
of the scientific forestry it's also a

1495
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,859
practice it's not something that is true

1496
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,059
in itself

1497
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:47,280
it's true in terms of practice right in

1498
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,839
terms of applications in terms of

1499
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,059
building communities around them so

1500
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:56,359
without this use they have no grounding

1501
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,980
yeah one

1502
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,940
really strong and Salient point that I

1503
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,200
got from the lecture was about

1504
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,359
generalized synchrony

1505
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:09,359
and it's almost funny that we have to

1506
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,460
Advocate or delineate generalized

1507
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,380
synchrony because the alternative the

1508
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,540
absence of generalized synchrony

1509
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,780
is just like kind of like an ideal gas

1510
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,480
it's like there wouldn't be regularities

1511
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,059
in society we wouldn't be clustered in

1512
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:26,760
space or in time we wouldn't have

1513
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,400
information and communication and

1514
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,079
we wouldn't have

1515
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:33,839
what differentiates

1516
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,539
a society or a group or civilization or

1517
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:39,180
a colony or whatever from literally

1518
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:40,920
anything else

1519
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,619
so generalized synchrony is almost like

1520
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:47,640
all of the space between nothing and

1521
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,339
anything happening

1522
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,859
and then it supports all these different

1523
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:55,680
scenarios we could have

1524
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,380
this kind of mind in this kind of brain

1525
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,299
in this kind of environment this kind of

1526
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:03,599
Niche and so we can talk about the ant

1527
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,700
colony foraging algorithms that work in

1528
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,720
the desert

1529
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,640
and there might be mutual

1530
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,039
non-exhausted

1531
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,440
open-ended change of algorithms and what

1532
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,420
works in a different setting

1533
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,880
and with humans we have

1534
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,819
the sophistication and the history

1535
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:23,940
and the scope and the scale and all of

1536
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:30,180
these metas and weaving with is an ought

1537
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,720
and our own forward going

1538
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,819
Direction

1539
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:38,400
which is really the moment where it goes

1540
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,200
from being a forensic

1541
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,539
sociology

1542
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:46,440
to the real time sense making

1543
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,980
an action selection based upon

1544
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,039
our cognitive models in the broader

1545
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,180
sense which includes humans and

1546
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,280
non-human agents but it's like that's

1547
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,559
when it goes from being more than just

1548
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,099
an understanding when that understanding

1549
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:04,619
translates to an action policy and they

1550
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:05,760
do

1551
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,920
then

1552
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,619
it matters as much as anything does

1553
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,900
yeah well one of the criticism of the

1554
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,899
active information I think is too

1555
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:21,899
General to single out

1556
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,020
specific constraints that Orient action

1557
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:25,979
right

1558
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,899
that's what I saw like thinking about

1559
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:29,580
how symbols

1560
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,839
uh

1561
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:33,179
brought about in community of Youth

1562
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:35,719
language users

1563
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:38,460
assuming that the symbols are not they

1564
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,759
they are only meaningful throughout this

1565
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,040
histories and practices

1566
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:48,299
can help us to apply this type of

1567
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:51,719
General story

1568
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:53,899
right yeah

1569
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:57,179
navigating specific uh

1570
01:08:57,179 --> 01:08:59,160
well epistemic communities and I think

1571
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,620
like that's the work that my whole is

1572
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,000
going to bring along in terms of

1573
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,738
epistemic communities and then you

1574
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:06,899
single out in them so you have these

1575
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,819
communities of

1576
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:11,339
language users in which specific

1577
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:13,259
practices

1578
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:17,299
create a specific orientations

1579
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:20,100
yeah one thought on that

1580
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,279
asking like what is

1581
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:25,140
uh active inference or linear regression

1582
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,560
or some other method again this is who

1583
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,140
knows is this just deep esoteric

1584
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,960
instrumentalism but asking what does it

1585
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,698
have to say about this symbol what is

1586
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:37,259
what does active inference have to say

1587
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:40,880
about the letter E in English

1588
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:43,020
can it be as simple as to say that

1589
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,120
that's a category error and that you

1590
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,920
could make a toy example or a

1591
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,779
pedagogical example where symbol one and

1592
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:52,140
symbol two awesomely in a multi-agent

1593
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,120
simulation or you could make a

1594
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,800
generative model for an alphabet and

1595
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,960
leave it abstract but you're never going

1596
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,560
to connect to the historiosity and the

1597
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,560
real enactment of the English letter e

1598
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,620
unless you're confronting

1599
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,580
that my new particulars and the actual

1600
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,560
embodiment of that letter

1601
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,880
and then there's different course

1602
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,679
screenings different iterated modeling

1603
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,900
decisions different questions about how

1604
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,300
do you include and participate in a

1605
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,380
different stage of the scientific

1606
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,060
process but it's like you're in the

1607
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,100
specifics at that point

1608
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,500
active inference doesn't have an opinion

1609
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,120
on the letter e because we wouldn't want

1610
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,340
it to it would be too opinionated about

1611
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,600
the wrong things it'd be making

1612
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,040
assumptions

1613
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,460
and bringing axioms into play that would

1614
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,560
be extremely constraining

1615
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:44,640
and so it

1616
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,219
remains General as a framework and the

1617
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:49,800
free energy principle even more slash

1618
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,380
differently so but when we get into the

1619
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,060
actual that's where we're connecting to

1620
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,400
the real systems of interest but how how

1621
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,199
can we make claims

1622
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:00,420
and Advance them socially about systems

1623
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,679
of Interest

1624
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,960
when we're not even it's like comparing

1625
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,300
bridge building as a concept with this

1626
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,460
bridge right here

1627
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,280
it's a little bit like a a category

1628
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,280
disconnect

1629
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:17,400
yeah

1630
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,920
well it depends on also how you single

1631
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,719
out some things they are not they're

1632
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:22,860
just you just don't do that because

1633
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,179
they're just not interesting enough

1634
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,600
right there's nothing like that comes

1635
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,100
out of it

1636
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,699
in terms of this bridge right here in a

1637
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:34,020
single

1638
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:37,020
how did you put it again like

1639
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,540
your category of bridges in this bridge

1640
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,840
right here right when you do that you

1641
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,600
can learn something about a category in

1642
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,719
terms of this single one right here

1643
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,780
why does not it's not exhaustive

1644
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,820
that's it that's the thing one point

1645
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,040
it's not exhaustive and it's not right

1646
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,940
or wrong it might be better than

1647
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,820
other I think they did like you can

1648
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,440
bring some com you can make some

1649
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,480
comparisons in terms of like predictive

1650
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,940
value you can have like better or worse

1651
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,760
ways of doing it and then it gains more

1652
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,100
utility

1653
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,920
okay connecting this to also

1654
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,520
um this this non-exhaustive nature and

1655
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,260
where the power of a generalizable

1656
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,239
framework is let's talk about the

1657
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,300
category of Golden Gate bridges in San

1658
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,260
Francisco

1659
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,600
so there's only one actual Bridge there

1660
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,760
but we're generalizing it and so

1661
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,760
somebody makes a state space and says

1662
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,140
well I'm exploring if there was more

1663
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,960
than two end to end so they're exploring

1664
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,760
the state space of topology is a bridge

1665
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,020
and someone else is exploring the state

1666
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,120
space of color and somebody else is

1667
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,920
exploring the state space of traffic

1668
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,540
Dynamics and someone else is combining

1669
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,159
two of them or combining all three of

1670
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:50,940
them

1671
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,219
and then that's the conversation is

1672
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:56,100
which map of this category of State

1673
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,840
spaces

1674
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,380
category of adjacent possibles as we

1675
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,420
chose to model it

1676
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,340
and if you don't include traffic flow

1677
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,719
don't be surprised that it's not going

1678
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,219
to take that kind of data or make that

1679
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:11,040
kind of prediction and some variables

1680
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,900
matter and some matter in combination

1681
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,800
and some don't but when we model we kind

1682
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,520
of build these

1683
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,239
regions or adjacencies to the actual

1684
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,520
which is where the historiosity of the

1685
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,440
past leaves us

1686
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,159
and then we have an adjacent possible as

1687
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,860
modelers and sense makers

1688
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,159
including absurd counterfactuals and

1689
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,420
state spaces

1690
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:44,480
and then the state spaces are mobilized

1691
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,679
yeah in a way but if you talk about like

1692
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,739
specific type of engineering yes in that

1693
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:55,260
since they are mobilized and they are

1694
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,420
not true or false you can use false

1695
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,960
models that is to function that's not

1696
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,560
like you can you have specific uses of

1697
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,300
things that you know they're not really

1698
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,980
true like the thing the tolerate

1699
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,640
caloric type of modeling the uh

1700
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,760
social uh the solar system is to use

1701
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,679
that to navigate you know in the desert

1702
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,360
even though it's not really accurate but

1703
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,000
if you want to go from A to B it helps

1704
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,380
you to do that

1705
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,520
that's

1706
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,020
the different thing right like it

1707
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,659
doesn't it's not true or false but when

1708
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:33,780
you think about agents in terms of like

1709
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,820
and if bringing back to the idea of uh

1710
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,440
symbols being only cashed out in terms

1711
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,900
of community fuses that have histories

1712
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,739
and

1713
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:46,739
and they they are made useful they're

1714
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:48,179
made meaningful in terms of their

1715
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:49,620
practices

1716
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,360
then you you don't have ever this

1717
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,219
disconnect actually right you have a

1718
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:54,840
cover you can think about this cognition

1719
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,179
as always connected so there's a

1720
01:14:57,179 --> 01:14:59,640
specific types of practicing you can

1721
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,000
even single out some moments of it

1722
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,880
and try to see what you learn from this

1723
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,699
kind of slides of time

1724
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:10,739
but when you think about the whole story

1725
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,719
of the cognitive system

1726
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,880
you can if you're gonna really think of

1727
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,860
it in terms that

1728
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:21,120
is valuable you cannot disconnect from

1729
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,520
the state let's say the legislate space

1730
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,020
of it

1731
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,260
s practice

1732
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,519
awesome well so

1733
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,360
do you have any closing

1734
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,520
[Music]

1735
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,679
thoughts or what are you looking forward

1736
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,320
to with the discussion section the rest

1737
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,780
of the course just by way of wrapping up

1738
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,179
and letting people know any other

1739
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:46,500
thoughts

1740
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,460
yeah

1741
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,800
we go to explore this this idea that

1742
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,960
we've been actually bringing along here

1743
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,900
right how we can go with that like

1744
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,840
instrumentally a realistically or how

1745
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,140
can we understand this General

1746
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:04,020
synchronization of the model in terms of

1747
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,780
specific

1748
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:08,900
instantiations and how

1749
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,340
formative they are is that really

1750
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,020
interesting or

1751
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,280
how candies things be actually refined

1752
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,540
in terms of

1753
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,840
modeling and if that happens does that

1754
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,179
have any specific consequences actually

1755
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,500
or not right maybe not

1756
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,900
awesome well

1757
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,719
very ambitious and excellent lecturer so

1758
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:37,140
thank you very much lerna and yeah just

1759
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,600
yeah just keep in mind it was just I was

1760
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,100
just like trying to ask these questions

1761
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,900
I don't also have those answers like

1762
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,260
it's I I found very little about active

1763
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,400
inference and semiotics like produced I

1764
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,580
found like a few papers so that's very

1765
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,860
exploratory actually so yeah so we're

1766
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,020
invited to think of these things and

1767
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,760
explore a little bit then further if

1768
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,800
it's possible yeah

1769
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,020
oh epic all right

1770
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,580
thank you Laura see you in a couple of

1771
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,980
weeks farewell see you bye
