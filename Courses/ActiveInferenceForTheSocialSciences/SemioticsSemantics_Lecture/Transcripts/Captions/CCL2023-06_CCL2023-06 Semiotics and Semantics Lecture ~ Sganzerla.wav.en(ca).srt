1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,820
All right. Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,298
This is the course active inference for

3
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:14,178
the social sciences in 2023.

4
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:16,594
It's August 30, or maybe a different

5
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,010
date, depending on where you are. And

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,154
today we're in the "Semiotics and

7
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:23,906
semantics" section. We'll be hearing a

8
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:26,678
lecture from Lorena Sganzerla,

9
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:28,346
and then we're going to have a little

10
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:30,554
bit of a discussion. So, Lorena, thank

11
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:33,898
you a lot for joining and off to you for

12
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:37,002
the lecture. Okay,

13
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:41,070
hello, everyone. I'm based

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,802
in Australia. Yeah, I'm Lorena. I'm

15
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,122
doing actually my PhD in philosophy

16
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:49,358
here. We work in cognitive sciences and

17
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:51,978
philosophy. I work with concepts and

18
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:55,090
notions of information. So I'm very

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,118
interested in foundational understanding

20
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:00,994
of cognitive sciences and information

21
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:04,614
and how these kind of things cash out.

22
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,240
And this is why I was interested in

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,766
talking about semantics and social

24
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:15,462
cognition to see how these things cash

25
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:18,810
out. I have a few ideas on how semiotics

26
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,446
can be compatible with, like, active

27
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,858
inference, and I try to organize a

28
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:28,902
little bit of this semiotic notion and

29
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,662
active inference to see if they pan out.

30
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,966
Maybe they don't. So let's see how it

31
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:37,386
goes. So let's

32
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:38,826
talk about active inference, formal

33
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:41,230
semantics, and social cognition.

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,350
What's up? Okay, I cannot move my Lloyds

35
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,106
now. I can. So I

36
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:55,362
will first have a very short

37
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,002
introduction for you guys I have out

38
00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:59,278
here. So what are you going to do?

39
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,058
Like, we have a short introduction. I'm

40
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:02,226
going to talk a little bit of theories

41
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:04,614
of meaning, and then we're going to talk

42
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:06,446
a little bit the free energy principle

43
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:09,606
and active inference and how shared

44
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,770
symbols and social cognition can be

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,226
thought together. I bring one case that

46
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,434
I find interesting and then we draw some

47
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,414
conclusions. So let me know what you

48
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,766
think in the comments and after we can

49
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,326
have a little discussion or in the next

50
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:26,190
session.

51
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,854
So the

52
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,918
background introduction that I want to

53
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,154
first point to is we are talking

54
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,394
about biological agents and how they

55
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:41,954
act. So we are always thinking in terms

56
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:45,570
of biological agents acting to express

57
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,826
in ways that express informational

58
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,106
sensitivities to context dependent

59
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:53,222
relevance to their environment and

60
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:57,450
things that involve communities.

61
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,482
However, how this very minimal way of

62
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:05,274
talking about what motivates and what is

63
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,626
relevant to people becomes stable enough

64
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:11,262
as a self sustaining pattern of

65
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,078
interactions, like, are they stable and

66
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,862
how they become that stable? So how can

67
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,338
those information sensitivities ground

68
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:22,462
values, norms, and goals consistently

69
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:26,898
and over time, assuming that those

70
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,834
values and goals are necessary for

71
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:31,826
meaningful interactions? So we have to

72
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:34,066
align motivations to behavior, right?

73
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,280
That's not really obvious. And

74
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,294
ultimately how meaning is brought about.

75
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,070
I don't think I'm going to answer that,

76
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,354
but I want to point to some directions

77
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,770
and how people have been thinking about

78
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,700
these questions over time.

79
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,734
So the problem of meaning has a brief

80
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,590
account, right? Like, traditionally

81
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,774
approaches of to cognition,

82
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,006
localize meaning inside individual

83
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,230
organisms and more specifically, inside

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,800
their minds so meaning pertains to

85
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,400
content in this kind of thing.

86
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,382
However, like many have a developmental

87
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,586
history so it's hard to catch those two

88
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,014
things together if it's inside people's

89
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:22,814
minds. How we can have an evolutionary

90
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,066
and developmental history assuming

91
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,854
that meanings are things that we can

92
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:31,366
learn over time and they happen in

93
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,614
shared context, they don't happen out of

94
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,870
nowhere in a vision, from nowhere.

95
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,034
In a sense we can say that it's not

96
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,518
really trivial that conventionalized

97
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:48,060
words like for example,

98
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,770
the conventionalized meaning of a word,

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,334
for instance, catch means catch, have

100
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,574
evolutionary histories one thing does

101
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,878
not come from the other. We need a

102
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,214
broader understanding to cash this

103
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,110
meaning out and that's where I'm

104
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,282
stepping from. That's my grounding. We

105
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,970
need to cast these things out in terms

106
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,362
of community of language users which

107
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,186
brings a problem, right? We have goals

108
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,382
and values that can be defined in terms

109
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,854
of those communities and you have

110
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,462
material embodied factors. So how these

111
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:26,762
two things are together or how

112
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:31,718
goals and values affect and motivate

113
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:34,060
material and embodied agents?

114
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,202
To answer this kind of question, like

115
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,082
over time, there are a few preferred

116
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:44,794
ways. I will do a brief overview

117
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:48,126
of some theories of meaning usually in

118
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,854
terms of cognitive sciences and any

119
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,046
philosophy of mind. That's what I'm

120
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:55,122
interested in how they cast it out.

121
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,554
They usually try to think of those

122
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:00,942
things in terms of syntax like concerns

123
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:04,574
with form as an abstract organizing

124
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:07,000
kind of rule is a type of grammar and

125
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,966
how the order of things and how the

126
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:14,674
logical unfolding of those symbols,

127
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:18,106
how they become meaningful. But the

128
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,346
syntax itself is not really enough to

129
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:23,100
cash out meaning in semantics. So then

130
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,882
in that sense syntax evolve into a field

131
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,630
that we call semantics, in which meaning

132
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,626
and mental content are organized.

133
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:35,630
Throughout this instructional syntax

134
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,366
then we have propositional knowledge and

135
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:41,822
truth conditions in which allows these

136
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:45,378
organizational story of meaningful words

137
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:47,442
to make sense and they're going to point

138
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:51,506
out into the outside world. And we have

139
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:54,382
a third option it's not so new,

140
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:57,462
but it's not so famous, which is

141
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:59,446
semantics. Or more importantly, I will

142
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,270
focus on biosemantics.

143
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,040
It concerns with the use of symbols like

144
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,506
how they bring about meaning in terms of

145
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,402
pragmatics and that will be a little bit

146
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:13,434
different and we'll catch it out in

147
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:16,780
different terms in relation to

148
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,870
its peers like semantics and syntax.

149
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,574
Well, syntax is pretty clear in terms of

150
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:25,070
being rules, right? So what is semantics

151
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,466
talk about? So talk about mental

152
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,502
content, about intentionality, about

153
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:32,146
mental representations in the sense we

154
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,882
have semantics that have specific key

155
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,998
concepts that reference truth conditions

156
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:40,766
and denotation. So if you have mental

157
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,254
content and if you put these meanings

158
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,094
inside the organism, it has to refer to

159
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,590
something else. And how this cognitive

160
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,302
penetration happens. Like, how can

161
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:55,078
meaning come about inside the mind?

162
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:58,394
And how that refers to something outside

163
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:01,094
in the world and how this observational

164
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,642
viewpoint of you thinking about

165
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,962
something in front of you can be

166
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:08,054
actually true. So we need truth

167
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:10,974
conditions that denote this specific

168
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:14,810
relationship and that is represented

169
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,040
in terms of mental content

170
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,574
contemporarily there's like various ways

171
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:25,746
of catching this out that can be

172
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,714
functional, that can be more

173
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:31,602
internalized mental specific types of

174
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:33,358
representations grounded in vehicles.

175
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,298
It's a very rich discussion and I don't

176
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,126
want to go into all that. I just want to

177
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,846
point it out that science and

178
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:43,190
neuroscience use those terms to study

179
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,842
and to build models that relate to

180
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:49,814
mental representations in terms of neuro

181
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,202
representations because it kind of makes

182
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:54,106
sense for us like brain activity. You

183
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:58,758
can see them in terms of what happens by

184
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,146
studying human beings and by studying

185
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:02,906
animals and how these mental

186
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,486
representations relate to something that

187
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,470
happens in the world. You can see that

188
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,854
one behavior elicits specific activities

189
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:13,570
and they have a correlational

190
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,054
relationship and that is highly

191
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:22,450
debated. But there we go. We have many

192
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,258
types of cashing out neural

193
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:27,400
representations and concerning to this

194
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,014
relationship of stimuli and the

195
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:34,294
interpretation of this stimuli and how

196
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,690
they motivate action.

197
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,950
That's already a very much weaker claim

198
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,562
in relation to mental content and things

199
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:48,218
being inside organisms but it is still

200
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,650
in the same line of reasoning.

201
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,342
And there is also biosemiotics which I

202
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,662
want to focus a little bit more because

203
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,406
it concerns the use and the

204
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,766
interpretation of signs and symbols

205
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:06,226
which also emphasizes the

206
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,014
embodied nature and the situated nature

207
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,494
of meaning. So you don't have meaning

208
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,914
without those practices and without the

209
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:15,640
use of embodied agents.

210
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,462
So we have to reject the idea that

211
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,654
meaning are abstract symbols or they

212
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:24,646
going to be something that has to be in

213
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:26,022
your mind and refer to something

214
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,106
outside. They're going to only exist in

215
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,266
this type of relationship and they can

216
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,230
take many forms including chemical

217
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,290
signals like visual clues, behavior,

218
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,434
words like the word cat you can have how

219
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,246
you organize the word cat. They are all

220
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,774
symbolic and that fits also in that kind

221
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,222
of structure. So they are very important

222
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:50,654
for communication, obviously because we

223
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,426
do communicate in terms of pointing to

224
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,514
the same shared notions of symbols in

225
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:59,822
words and also other types of symbolic

226
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:03,490
meaning and we coordinate life around

227
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,182
them. So living systems are then here

228
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:07,986
characterized by the biosemite

229
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:11,266
semiotics, by their ability of creating

230
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,298
and interpreting and using these symbols

231
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:16,150
in terms of their practices. The fathers

232
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,380
of biosemiotics started

233
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,694
probably in the 19th century and Ox

234
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:29,106
Cole is one of the most famous

235
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:32,942
representatives. Currently you can find

236
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:37,120
new authors like Hoffman, Maya or

237
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,706
Baker. So I tried

238
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:45,346
to organize a little bit in

239
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:48,114
a specific model, in a type of model,

240
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:51,314
in a visual story, how these two

241
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,966
types of understanding meaning are being

242
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:57,314
applied in terms of theories

243
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,922
of meaning historically.

244
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,438
So in biosemiotics we have the

245
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:04,614
pragmatics and you have the practice and

246
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:06,574
they relate to dynamics and context

247
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,146
dependent. So you can see here on the

248
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:13,114
top of the screen how agent we have the

249
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,130
agent relationship with its

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,882
psychological and social aspects and

251
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:21,002
biosemiotics is somewhat concerned how

252
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:23,274
correlation leads to prediction and

253
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,430
beliefs and that leads to expectations.

254
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,982
And we also have other types of theories

255
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:35,294
like telesymantics and and theories

256
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:37,954
of computational syntax that tries to

257
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,426
understand the dynamics and the

258
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:43,140
mechanism of this relationship.

259
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,934
And they are not really crossing each

260
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:49,560
other.

261
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,942
They're not talking about the same

262
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,402
necessary things. So how can these

263
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,900
things be brought together?

264
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,098
That's when I was thinking how we can

265
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:06,474
bring this free energy principle and

266
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:09,340
active inference in terms of those

267
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,666
relationships. The free

268
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,154
energy principle and active inference,

269
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:19,374
as we know and I have been talking about

270
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:22,430
probably in the past two classes.

271
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,026
It's a model that is interesting for

272
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,686
that because it has like very minimal

273
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:29,778
assumptions. So it starts off from the

274
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,094
idea that organisms act to maintain

275
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,594
themselves in their expected biological

276
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,742
and cognitive states. So you're always

277
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:40,374
talking, you're modeling and using these

278
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:43,570
mathematicals to ground biological

279
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,120
agents in a very embodied sense.

280
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,802
And they do so by minimizing their free

281
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,786
energy. Right? So they have these

282
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:53,786
metabolical states that have to be

283
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:57,286
minimized in terms of expenditure,

284
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,794
in terms of uncertainty. Given that the

285
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,494
long term average of free energy is

286
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:04,254
entropy, they want to minimize their

287
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,094
uncertainty in terms of their

288
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:08,910
metabolical states. What that entails

289
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,246
that they have a specific range of

290
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,050
states they want to stay in, like

291
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,502
minimally to stay alive. To stay alive,

292
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,962
you have to do a bunch of things as a

293
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:21,214
human being, but every single embodied

294
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:23,582
agent would you prefer to stay alive?

295
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:26,870
So there are some preferred basic states

296
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,246
that we've defined how action will be

297
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,322
take first to maintain metabolical

298
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:35,654
states and how that coordinate with the

299
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:36,470
environment,

300
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,894
which entails that organisms

301
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:46,682
and agents can be described in those

302
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:49,886
terms. Like an active inference tries to

303
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,046
bring out those minimal assumptions in

304
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:55,130
mathematical terms that try to express

305
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,822
how reducing the probability of these

306
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,446
non anticipated states or states that

307
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,814
are not favorable to maintaining their

308
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:06,242
minimal metabolical needs will

309
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,554
be reduced. Right? And that can be

310
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,490
catched in terms of a generative model,

311
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,462
as we've been saying throughout the past

312
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:17,746
actions, how this generative model sets

313
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:20,198
specific times and organizes around

314
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:24,022
specific parameters that can

315
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:28,170
be described as trying to maintain those

316
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,490
parameters within reasonable range.

317
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,874
So by minimizing free energy on

318
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:40,602
average and over time, this system will

319
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,606
self organize. So we will bring out the

320
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:44,862
parameters of its internal states that

321
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,078
occupy a limited number of possible

322
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,800
states. We will set into a specific

323
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,314
range that will then be then

324
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:59,202
will be used as somewhat the base

325
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,794
and the guide for this behavior. You

326
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:05,806
have two kinds of dynamics

327
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:08,326
happening here, right? That's what I

328
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,726
want to talk about a little bit. So we

329
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,046
have then a phenotype that exists in a

330
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,806
specific type of states, but that will

331
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:16,978
have to coordinate two different kinds

332
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:19,254
of dynamics. They're going to be stated

333
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:21,834
here as complementary, right? You have

334
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:24,054
flow states and have belief updating.

335
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,714
So with flow states you have one type of

336
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,534
modeling which is the known equilibrium

337
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:31,534
steady states that we use intrinsic is

338
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,006
named here intrinsic information

339
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:35,322
geometry and you have belief updating

340
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:39,210
that can be treated as extrinsic

341
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,466
informational geometry and those are

342
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:45,490
different types of modeling

343
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,690
or different types of thinking about

344
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,786
those processes that's most important,

345
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:54,374
right? So in terms of flow states we

346
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:57,702
can talk about dynamical system and how

347
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:00,278
you settle and self organize specific

348
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,906
parameters. And in terms of belief

349
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,086
updating we will be talking about

350
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:06,790
Bayesian mathematics and Bayesian

351
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,480
cognition and specific

352
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,898
ways of cashing out how an agent will

353
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:19,106
change and behave over time in relation

354
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,654
to the dynamics that is

355
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:25,966
set into place in this state space of

356
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,150
possible actions.

357
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,034
So while dynamical systems will explore

358
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:34,922
temporal and contextual, dependence

359
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:38,082
between environment and agent will set

360
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:40,834
this specific state space that has

361
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,022
temporal dimension and has contextual

362
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:45,606
dimension. And once this state space is

363
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:47,766
sort of established, we have more or

364
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:53,122
less deterministic

365
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:57,370
approach to what can possibly

366
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,954
unfold. So how changes and

367
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:04,346
how behavior can be cashed out in

368
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:07,594
terms of nondeterministic behavior and

369
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:10,240
that is defined by the different type of

370
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,120
probabilistic thinking

371
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,774
which is the Bayesian mechanics of

372
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,926
belief, of belief updating. So we have

373
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:23,886
then a process of belief updating

374
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:26,530
throughout weighted interactions within

375
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,100
this range of possible

376
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,154
states. So we do have dynamics

377
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,360
and we do also have biasian process

378
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,814
unfolding together in terms of

379
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,654
mechanisms. And with that

380
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,210
we do have mathematical statements

381
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,874
providing a unifying perspective on

382
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:51,014
formal approaches connecting behavior

383
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:54,522
and dynamics. So that's what

384
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:56,662
active inference should be bringing

385
00:18:56,726 --> 00:19:00,282
about as a novelty in relation to older

386
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:04,240
forms of understanding organisms which

387
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,990
can either cash things out in term of

388
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,742
behavior or in terms of dynamics. So

389
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:10,974
trying to bring these two things

390
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:12,802
together is quite interesting to

391
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:15,586
understand how symbols and what is

392
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:19,966
semantics for instance? So that's

393
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:22,434
the question I will be asking right now.

394
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,600
Let's talk a little bit about that.

395
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,286
I'm drawing here from quite interesting

396
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:33,266
paper from Maxwell

397
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:38,810
Ramstead and in politely is

398
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,026
free energy principle a principle for

399
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,274
formal semantics? So what would be

400
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:48,906
formal semantics? It sounds like an

401
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,006
oxymoron, right? Like how semantics can

402
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,134
be formal, how can you formalize it? So

403
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,970
semantics, the theory of meaningful

404
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,302
things. So how can that be empty of

405
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:02,066
content? Well, it has

406
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,210
a few principles in which you can

407
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,514
explain what formal semantics should how

408
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:10,370
a formal semantics should be understood.

409
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,214
First off, we have Bayesian formalism

410
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,890
that does not necessarily have to commit

411
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,210
to classical notions of representations

412
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,606
which are propositional in nature, have

413
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:23,974
propositional semantic content. So the

414
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:28,086
idea is that you can use the notion

415
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:30,714
of a representation in a way that is not

416
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:32,886
necessarily contentful. So how that's

417
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:35,546
going to be? So under the free energy

418
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,770
principle, representations can be

419
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,766
formal. That's the argument they are

420
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:44,490
bringing under the physics of flow,

421
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,682
specifically dynamical system theories

422
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,214
and information geometry you can have

423
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:52,738
these mathematical statements that only

424
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:57,106
represent possible specific

425
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,946
ways of interacting, how these

426
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,722
correlations will affect each other over

427
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:05,974
time in this variational base type of

428
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:10,470
cashing out mathematical functionals.

429
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,782
In this sense, we can talk about

430
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:16,134
representational, how they can be

431
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:18,186
understood under this formalism. And

432
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,202
what they are saying is they are best

433
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,314
understood as internal structures that

434
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:25,722
enable the system to parse out their

435
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:28,214
sensory sensitivities or the sensory

436
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:31,966
streams. So to organize them in specific

437
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:34,014
parameters and also in the terms of

438
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,134
their own Markov blankets in their

439
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,400
blanket states,

440
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,518
which is interesting here. What is the

441
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,454
new genealogy of this paper is that

442
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:48,886
grounding a mathematical model in these

443
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,320
mathematical properties of the system

444
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,782
will avoid grounding these

445
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,166
properties in terms of the properties of

446
00:21:58,188 --> 00:22:00,554
symbols and thematics in abstract or

447
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:03,290
subjective notions of meaning, but

448
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,570
impossible ranges of action.

449
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,334
So summing up, what we had before was a

450
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,830
type of computational model that had

451
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,430
specific components that does not allow

452
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,054
for the intelligibility intelligibility

453
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:23,650
of a cognitive component which is

454
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,290
intention, which is motivation,

455
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,226
context, brain, computer metaphors. We

456
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,710
have neuro and cognitive activity often

457
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,642
seen as a transfer of symbolic

458
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:40,198
information and cognition, then a

459
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:42,754
snapshot of this transfer. So it's

460
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:45,574
totally dependent of that kind of

461
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,402
symbolical transfer which is really

462
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:50,046
difficult to explain how that's going to

463
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,378
be biologically plausible and there's a

464
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,906
lot of effort trying to do that. So if

465
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:57,114
you're interested in this, there's a

466
00:22:57,152 --> 00:23:00,654
very vast wealth of literature but they

467
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:04,494
have to answer to this problem. So how

468
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:06,942
the mind and brain needs to produce an

469
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:09,310
impromptu response to inputs of the

470
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,594
external environment all the time and

471
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:14,786
the idea of this formal semantics the

472
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:17,554
authors is trying to explain is trying

473
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:20,290
to include this component into the

474
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,330
model. So you have a deflationary model

475
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,646
about content, so you have a formal

476
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:27,430
semantics, you have semantics without

477
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,646
content. Interestingly and formulated as

478
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:34,098
a variation

479
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,410
of free energy functional. So those

480
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,914
structures that embody those process

481
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,306
correspond to states in the system and

482
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:48,670
we also have the biological component

483
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,242
that can be formalized

484
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,354
in terms of disturb informational

485
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:58,814
geometry that these two densities do

486
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:02,194
probabilistic densities, one from the

487
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,202
dynamics and one from the Bay agent

488
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:10,984
describing behavior and

489
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:13,928
now what? So how can active inference be

490
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,284
compatible to biosematics? Can it be

491
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,284
actually compatible or is it even

492
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:19,180
necessary?

493
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,596
Well, active inference is a

494
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:28,816
very general framework and then it does

495
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:32,544
not really give us the tools to

496
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:36,370
understand how encoding can happen

497
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,332
in terms of symbols, like how

498
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:44,288
they can be broadcasted into collective

499
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:47,972
action because prediction alone does not

500
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:50,564
explain how do they come about. So in

501
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:54,820
this sense we do have meaningful

502
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,320
correlations that refer

503
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,152
to the dynamics of one or two or more

504
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:04,756
systems in terms of informational

505
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:07,896
geometry that needs to

506
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:10,300
be cached out with predictive value. So

507
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,870
how is this possible?

508
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,736
Well, we can talk about that in terms of

509
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:22,032
shared attention. That's one form of

510
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,880
this kind of model to cash this out. So

511
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,180
we have active inference capturing

512
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,312
relevant statistical relations between

513
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:34,692
environment and aging. And why

514
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:36,948
I'm trying to think about here is how

515
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:40,676
biosyniotics offer tools for these

516
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,448
informational sensitivities and

517
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:45,444
statistical relations to cache symbols

518
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:48,040
in terms of use and interpretation

519
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,200
within communities of language users.

520
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,332
And that can only happen in the sense

521
00:25:58,386 --> 00:26:01,564
via directed action. So the problem now

522
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:04,652
will turn into how is it possible to

523
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:07,412
specify the factors that are sufficient

524
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:11,088
to constrain action and direct

525
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:19,680
that into specific interaction

526
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,160
fault is through the history interaction

527
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,660
fault is European forestry.

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,790
I'm picking this example from a very

529
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,300
like from James,

530
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,504
I really recommend kind of tells this

531
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:44,420
story about how coordinated action,

532
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,840
how states coordinate specific

533
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,908
collective actions. But that's not the

534
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,500
point that I want to talk here. So here,

535
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,724
let's unfold that a little bit in terms

536
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,316
of the design of scientific forestry and

537
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:58,496
think about scientific forestry as a

538
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:01,744
practice. And a practice that has an

539
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:05,170
organizing principle that will like

540
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,730
that will be the main important

541
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,470
articulating story that can

542
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,016
connect together how agriculture layouts

543
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:21,556
plantations in specific ways and how

544
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:24,776
collective farms will make specific

545
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:27,652
choices in terms of this organization

546
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:29,924
and how villages can structure

547
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:33,524
themselves around one specific notion

548
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:36,540
or one specific organizational principle

549
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,444
and how everything can be calculated to

550
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:43,692
make one type of

551
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,356
practice, which is agriculture is a very

552
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:47,404
general, more legible and more

553
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:50,940
manipulable for different

554
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,312
kinds of communities. So in that we will

555
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:57,020
involve manipulating the very concrete

556
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,992
aspects of the land, the terrain,

557
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:03,236
the products, the workforce. So it has a

558
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:07,190
very encompassing effect over time and

559
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,510
in a very concrete sense.

560
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,770
And interestingly when you talk about

561
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,244
European forestry and how European

562
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,904
forestry was modeling the terrain and

563
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:25,304
how it's catching out value of these

564
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:27,564
terrains. They were not trying to do

565
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:30,220
that to successfully depict the full

566
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,420
range of diversity of the actual social

567
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,144
activity and the actual activity

568
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:40,096
of agriculture or the richness of the

569
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,432
vegetation or they are not even trying.

570
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,384
They didn't intend to do that. That was

571
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:48,364
not the point of this kind of modeling

572
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:51,332
turned into a practice, right? Those

573
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:54,528
models generally represent

574
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:57,412
specific slices of nature that were

575
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:00,032
interesting for one specific official

576
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:04,020
observer. And that

577
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,172
point is really important because that

578
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:11,600
will shape how all these communities

579
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,824
and how the terrain and how the forest

580
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,116
will unfold over time within this

581
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:18,700
specific perspective.

582
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,764
So I bring here a quote that I really

583
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,784
really like because it tries to flesh

584
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,892
this out in simple terms and very useful

585
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:32,144
ones. So, thinking that

586
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:36,304
exaggerating only slightly, one might

587
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:40,852
say that the interest in forest was

588
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:44,436
resolved through one fiscal specific

589
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,440
single number, which was the revenue

590
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,292
that yield from the timber that was

591
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:53,652
extracted annually. Well, that's okay,

592
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,316
that's understandable, that's

593
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:56,968
intelligible and that happens to you

594
00:29:56,974 --> 00:29:59,592
every day. In terms of how we understand

595
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:02,088
our economy but what is interesting

596
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:04,980
about this quote is that the best way to

597
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,204
appreciate how heroic was this

598
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,796
constriction of vision is to notice what

599
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:14,604
falls outside the field of vision. So

600
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:17,512
what is missing from that is not the

601
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:19,824
organizational principle of timber being

602
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:23,248
valuable but everything that was not

603
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,724
there or was being excluded treason

604
00:30:25,772 --> 00:30:28,240
bushes and planters and plants that hold

605
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,820
little to non potential for that

606
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,284
purpose. So missing out of that is

607
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:36,416
floridiversity foliage, fruits, et

608
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,516
cetera, twigs and branches. Missing out

609
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,704
of that are insects and small animals.

610
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:44,070
Depending on this diversity, all this

611
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,988
ecological organization falls out of

612
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:52,564
the organizational principle and that

613
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,676
has very concrete consequences that we

614
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,870
still suffer. Her we still live in the

615
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,600
height of this climate

616
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,004
crisis that also starts from this kind

617
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:07,904
of thinking. So it has really very

618
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:11,056
material consequences for us and had for

619
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,344
them at the time, if you read more about

620
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:16,816
it, that a timber, by trimming and

621
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:20,012
domesticating nature, so much decreased

622
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:22,096
in quality and then eventually decreased

623
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:25,316
in value, which prompted them to try to

624
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:27,430
reorganize that kind of story.

625
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,676
And what? I want to call attention with

626
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:32,736
the example is that also it brings some

627
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,424
specific ways of talking about it. It

628
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:37,764
brings vocabulary that only exists

629
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,588
in terms of this type of practice

630
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,924
specifically. So this vocabulary

631
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:45,320
constrains nature in a way by pruning

632
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,960
what cannot be used. So it generates

633
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,364
more than a legible nature, but a way of

634
00:31:52,402 --> 00:31:54,444
making nature intelligible and

635
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:56,300
intelligible in a very specific certain

636
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,904
way. And we make that happen in terms of

637
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:02,896
symbolizing things in specific terms.

638
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,056
But the symbols, they don't exist in

639
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:07,330
themselves. They exist only in

640
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,452
organizing the social practice around

641
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:13,636
them. So when you replace nature with a

642
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:16,116
term called natural resources, we are

643
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:19,652
doing exactly that. It's specifying from

644
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,544
a generalized notion of nature like

645
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,376
flora and fauna becomes something

646
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:28,904
valuable, becomes a commodity but

647
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:32,584
not everything, right? It trims the

648
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:35,332
practice. It separates competing species

649
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,884
from value goods. So plants are

650
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,676
symbolized as crops and the

651
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:43,516
competing species are symbolized as

652
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:45,836
weeds. They are not necessarily crops or

653
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:47,544
weeds or anything like that in nature,

654
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:50,720
but they are that for the way we talk

655
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,800
like that because we practice

656
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,730
agriculture in a certain way.

657
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,312
That's the same for insects or small

658
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:01,108
animals that consume these interesting

659
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:05,556
crops. So the

660
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:08,004
material effect of that and how that

661
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:11,732
only gains traction in the practice over

662
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:14,724
time and how you have specific intention

663
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:19,368
that has unintended consequences are

664
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:23,012
necessarily here situated contextualized

665
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:25,424
and embodied in terms of trimming

666
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,804
specific types of attention. And this

667
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:31,164
attention will only shift to try

668
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,996
to repopulate infect population, for

669
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:37,084
instance, when you realize that this

670
00:33:37,122 --> 00:33:40,096
practice brought this specific effect in

671
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,968
a certain way that affects the value of

672
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:49,184
our understanding of nature and

673
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:52,964
that generates exactly a type of social

674
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:56,150
coherence and social coordination and

675
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,392
how constraints create this coherence,

676
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,070
right?

677
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,584
Well now let's talk back

678
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:10,020
again about formal semantics.

679
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,028
While this formal semantics and active

680
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:15,756
inference sort of embeds one type of

681
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:20,424
mathematical formalism symbols

682
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:23,596
can only be grounded in specific

683
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:26,300
concrete practices or inaction.

684
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,136
So while active inference can be used as

685
00:34:29,158 --> 00:34:31,840
a tool to explain social understanding,

686
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,436
it does do that in terms of generalized

687
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:38,748
synchronization in a model of cognition

688
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,884
that can be inactive and dynamic. But

689
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:43,876
this is still very general in terms of

690
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:47,732
biosematics. We can think of it

691
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,992
as a framework that might be compatible

692
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,352
with active inference in terms of

693
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:55,176
explaining the materiality of the

694
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:57,956
environment in a non reductive, in a non

695
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:00,164
reductionist way that tries to retain

696
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:03,544
some naturalistic credentials. So how

697
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:06,204
the conventions are affecting and

698
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:09,596
affecting the embodied agent in terms of

699
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:12,700
forming those symbols and cashing out

700
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,700
those epistemic values.

701
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,248
And well

702
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:24,256
social interaction in this sense is not

703
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:27,664
reduced to prediction because in this

704
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:29,808
sense, the prediction will not be a

705
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:33,188
primitive, but it will be a

706
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,456
result of a specific participatory

707
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:39,204
construction of the social scene over

708
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:42,796
specific. Organizational principles

709
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,810
and actions that,

710
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,920
through the synchronization of these

711
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,576
generative models, or the

712
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:53,688
synchronization of those agents that can

713
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,276
be described in terms of those

714
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:57,464
generative models, gain predictive

715
00:35:57,512 --> 00:35:59,964
value. And when you model that then you

716
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:02,972
have this type of understand the value

717
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:05,020
of prediction in those senses.

718
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,334
So that

719
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:14,710
allows that

720
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,926
allows us to say that social actors in

721
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:20,966
this sense can behave as if they have a

722
00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:24,442
generative model that synchronizes with

723
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:27,446
that symbolic state of affairs allowing

724
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:28,886
them to understand each other's

725
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:33,450
behaviors or to develop approximate

726
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,574
informational sensitive or

727
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:39,118
responsiveness to the same symbols and

728
00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:41,406
goals. They are approximate because

729
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:42,846
they're obviously not going to be the

730
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,094
same but they have the

731
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:48,530
same approximate orientation.

732
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,306
So in this sense, we don't have ever

733
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:55,362
a view from nowhere. We don't have ever

734
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,946
this view that is only cashed out in

735
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,286
terms of specific types of minds. But

736
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:04,646
you also have types of minds shaped in

737
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:08,546
terms of these very concrete

738
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:09,670
organizations.

739
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,336
That happens in a community, like for

740
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,160
humans at least, it happens in community

741
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,040
of language users. So their relationship

742
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,736
with symbolic cues helps to

743
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:29,180
select attention at that specific time

744
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,088
as well. Pruning what should be ignored

745
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:34,776
in socially constructed environments.

746
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:38,670
So within a specific community

747
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,524
of language users some types of actions

748
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:45,916
will be desirable and will be deemed

749
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:49,072
as true in that specific type of

750
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:51,964
community and can be only evaluated

751
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:55,236
under those terms. So you can provide

752
00:37:55,338 --> 00:38:00,644
reasons for actions in

753
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:03,924
that specific context and you can

754
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:07,940
talk about how rational

755
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,824
that action is in terms of the

756
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:13,320
conditions set by those communities.

757
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,630
And that brings us to the idea that

758
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,774
human cognition in this sense is never

759
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:26,422
decoupled from these cultural norms that

760
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:30,566
pushes and orients them over time. So in

761
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:32,266
those scale of behavior and that's the

762
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:34,166
interesting thing. And that's why active

763
00:38:34,198 --> 00:38:37,500
inference can be an interesting tool to

764
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,140
model this type of human communities and

765
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,550
this type of behavior because it can

766
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,142
come from the very dynamics, the very

767
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:51,406
basic of dynamics to specific types of

768
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:54,480
perception and scale up and more.

769
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,192
So when you have the problem of symbols,

770
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:04,710
like in these two decoupled possible

771
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,180
community of users and symbols and

772
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,324
embodied agents and things that do not

773
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:14,296
combine, we can try to model

774
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,536
our agents in a way that we don't have

775
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:18,004
this problem anymore because you're

776
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:25,368
trying to include that very component

777
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,510
into the model.

778
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,096
So in this sense, we have active

779
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:33,868
inference used as tools to explain

780
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,100
social understanding, as generalized

781
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,884
synchronization and in understanding

782
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:42,864
others. In that sense, because of this

783
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:45,664
generalized synchronization model and

784
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:52,816
assumed by those types of organizational

785
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:56,084
principles, we can also engage in terms

786
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,932
of niche construction. So we have a more

787
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:00,704
or less deterministic way of

788
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:04,276
understanding the nature

789
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:07,828
of symbols because the more we interact

790
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:10,456
and approximate synchronize with the

791
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:12,772
environment, we change the environment

792
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:15,324
that might change us back. So you have

793
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:18,332
an open system that is always and

794
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:21,516
everywhere situated and key can be

795
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:23,244
modeled then with this type of

796
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:28,764
predictive value. So that's

797
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:32,432
more or less what I had in mind and

798
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:34,448
that's how I was trying to think about

799
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:36,688
biosemiotics and in a possible

800
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:40,644
relationship with free

801
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:44,230
energy principle and the formalisms of

802
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,510
yeah, I think this is it.

803
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,020
Awesome. Thank you, Lorena. I'll just

804
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,922
organize things a little in my room.

805
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:08,322
But thank you very much for this

806
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:11,590
excellent lecture. Just as a kind of

807
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,606
warm up, how did you come to see it

808
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:18,678
this way? What brought you to this

809
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:22,246
general question of semantics and how

810
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,806
do you see that like on your own path

811
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,314
and see what other comparable or

812
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,986
analogous approaches have been done in

813
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:34,582
terms of a meta analysis and proposal

814
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,206
related to the naturalization of

815
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,150
semantics?

816
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,018
I think it's kind of hard to naturalize

817
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:44,766
semantics, right? I think there's a lot

818
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:47,374
of effort in doing that. And it might be

819
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:49,874
that if you think differently about how

820
00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:52,450
we naturalize those values,

821
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,970
we might have better answers.

822
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,734
Instead of trying to fit the agent into

823
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,766
the model, we try to fit the model into

824
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:07,286
the agent. Right? I think that was the

825
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:09,734
motivation. I think there's the

826
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:12,054
interesting part of biosymptics in that

827
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:13,882
sense. It tries to make less

828
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:17,034
assumptions. When we start

829
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:20,810
from a hardcore assumption or model

830
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,820
assumption, right. That semantics is

831
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,678
only within the mind, then we have a

832
00:42:27,684 --> 00:42:30,080
very hard time trying to explain that.

833
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,790
If you assume less about that, you might

834
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,530
bring different types of explanations,

835
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,278
of course, but they'd

836
00:42:39,294 --> 00:42:42,100
be more interesting. I was trying to see

837
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,386
how that looks like when you bring these

838
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:49,810
two things together in the terms of

839
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,542
active inference and free energy

840
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:53,654
principle, if that works, if that is

841
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:56,242
possible. I don't know if that answers

842
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:57,160
your question.

843
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,786
So wondering about that fundamental

844
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,726
question and then coming across active

845
00:43:05,758 --> 00:43:08,962
inference or how elsewhere have people

846
00:43:09,016 --> 00:43:11,970
brought in the more formal and technical

847
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,940
into this question?

848
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:23,846
What do you mean by more formal? And can

849
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,654
you repeat that, please? Yeah. How does

850
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:27,766
active inference help us or have

851
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:29,442
continuity or difference with previous

852
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:33,034
ways that people have connected? The

853
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:36,906
technical part from what

854
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:39,222
you described as the formal semantics

855
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,466
embeds the mathematical formalism, and

856
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:42,954
then the symbols are grounded in

857
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:46,298
specific action. So has that been played

858
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:48,830
out in other technical frameworks?

859
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,226
Well, we do have technical frameworks

860
00:43:51,258 --> 00:43:52,718
that try to organize that in terms of an

861
00:43:52,724 --> 00:43:54,926
activism right. And autopoietic and

862
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:57,618
activism. But then we just have in these

863
00:43:57,704 --> 00:44:01,220
terms, the notion of symbols sometimes

864
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,914
get loosely described. And I think these

865
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:06,530
guys are not really interested in that.

866
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,786
I think they're trying to describe

867
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:10,214
something else, for example, or you can

868
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:11,814
have some specific types of

869
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:15,542
computational if you

870
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:18,390
really buy into the mind computational

871
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,450
brain and computational mind metaphor,

872
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,220
then you have a hard time also to

873
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,610
explain how semantics are built into

874
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,826
that computation. Right. I don't think

875
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:33,482
anyone has a very strong answer to that.

876
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:35,534
You have to really buy into the idea of

877
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,198
information processing. And that's what

878
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:41,566
brought me a little bit to that. If you

879
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:43,278
buy into the metaphor of information

880
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:45,342
processing, then you need to have

881
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:48,514
semantics within the brain. If you try

882
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,834
to lose a little bit this notion, if you

883
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:52,882
try to understand process and

884
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:55,202
information in different terms, what

885
00:44:55,256 --> 00:44:57,726
happens? I think that was more or less

886
00:44:57,768 --> 00:44:59,638
the question that I was trying to ask.

887
00:44:59,804 --> 00:45:03,282
And if active inference and biosemiotics

888
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:06,610
can, because they have less assumptions

889
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,922
in terms of what happens inside

890
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:13,082
the processing information content in

891
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:14,060
the mind,

892
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,394
if that can bring interesting answers or

893
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,890
if you can use as a model to organize

894
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,750
behavior.

895
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,238
And there's another point that also

896
00:45:30,404 --> 00:45:34,318
brought me to this type of thinking,

897
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:38,420
was trying to understand how

898
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,586
active inference can include the

899
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:44,402
historicity of the agent. Right.

900
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:45,890
Because I think that something comes

901
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,346
across debated in active

902
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:52,134
inference, how you bring novelty into

903
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,018
the state space. Like, once you define

904
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:55,894
that state space, the state space is

905
00:45:55,932 --> 00:45:58,822
more or less deterministic because

906
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:00,266
everything will happen within that

907
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:02,150
specific range. So how does novelty

908
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,140
comes within this type of

909
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,460
modeling? So how can you explain that

910
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,860
if it does? I don't know.

911
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,222
It's more like an exploratory question

912
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,302
that I was trying to make and see how

913
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:21,118
that pans out. I actually also don't

914
00:46:21,124 --> 00:46:25,746
have an answer for that. But if

915
00:46:25,768 --> 00:46:28,574
you take seriously some more inactive

916
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,226
claims that you need history of

917
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:33,394
interactions to understand how agents

918
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:36,098
behave, you cannot understand agents

919
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:39,554
without that. So how does

920
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:41,710
active inference answer this question

921
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,662
specifically? Right,

922
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:48,454
because once yeah, I think that's still

923
00:46:48,492 --> 00:46:51,766
kind of debated. I'm not sure if there's

924
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:54,854
new developments in this specific topic,

925
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,274
but I remember I think two years ago was

926
00:46:57,312 --> 00:47:00,954
like this specific papers from

927
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:04,022
Di Paulo. I think the Lane dawa Forking

928
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,506
path is specifically focusing on that in

929
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:09,246
the formalisms and et cetera. So I don't

930
00:47:09,268 --> 00:47:12,158
know if these two things can bring a

931
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:15,334
little bit of more to the conversation,

932
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:19,362
maybe not. Great.

933
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,538
I'll just ask some more general

934
00:47:21,624 --> 00:47:23,154
questions. You're adding a lot with

935
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:26,098
these thoughts. So you said that social

936
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:28,470
interaction in this account is not

937
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,038
reduced to prediction. So how would you

938
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:35,730
unpack that and how would you relate

939
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,830
this? I don't know exactly

940
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,754
what term of art would go here, but this

941
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,486
kind of social epistemology that active

942
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:47,146
inference provides us in contrast to

943
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:50,666
say, predictive processing. So how is it

944
00:47:50,688 --> 00:47:52,454
that we would or wouldn't reduce

945
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,686
something to prediction? And then what

946
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,214
is it that active inference brings into

947
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:00,814
that discussion? Yeah, well,

948
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:02,046
I think I have two points in that.

949
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:04,240
Like, active inference in that sense has

950
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,814
a type of modeling that tries to include

951
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:09,854
all the time and everywhere the embodied

952
00:48:09,902 --> 00:48:12,980
agent. If you take seriously the idea,

953
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,418
the generative model is always

954
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:20,774
accurately modeling that

955
00:48:20,812 --> 00:48:24,326
specific agent because it

956
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:27,382
cannot be true or false, your current

957
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:30,570
state is like that even if you are not

958
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,346
feeling really well, you just know that

959
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,994
you're not feeling well in relation to

960
00:48:34,032 --> 00:48:37,226
something else. And that story

961
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:40,746
is still very accurate to your state

962
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:43,614
condition right now. Right.

963
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:47,546
So the prediction gains traction

964
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,966
socially at least in that sense, not in

965
00:48:49,988 --> 00:48:52,986
this specific detail of predictive

966
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:54,766
processing, I think, because I think

967
00:48:54,788 --> 00:48:56,654
that's more complicated. But socially,

968
00:48:56,702 --> 00:48:59,266
in social cognition, at least we can

969
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:00,818
talk about this predictive value, I

970
00:49:00,824 --> 00:49:02,434
think is a more interesting way to do

971
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:07,154
that because the

972
00:49:07,192 --> 00:49:08,866
example that I use in terms of catching

973
00:49:08,898 --> 00:49:12,646
out symbols, we are using something that

974
00:49:12,668 --> 00:49:16,022
was meant to make something

975
00:49:16,076 --> 00:49:18,022
intelligible that have very bad

976
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:21,338
consequences that were not even close to

977
00:49:21,344 --> 00:49:24,554
be predicted. So in that sense and how

978
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:27,606
these consequences happen, prediction

979
00:49:27,638 --> 00:49:29,626
cannot be there everywhere and all the

980
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:33,114
time. The prediction has an orientation

981
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:36,414
as well, right? So that's going to

982
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,362
unfold only in terms of the orientation,

983
00:49:38,426 --> 00:49:40,430
but that's not all encompassing.

984
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,318
What does that say about the prediction?

985
00:49:45,354 --> 00:49:46,914
That's why I was trying to think of it

986
00:49:46,952 --> 00:49:48,642
as not being a primitive, but something

987
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:51,570
that comes along with these dynamics.

988
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,370
Well, this is a very deep impresscient

989
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,426
point that because the causal structure

990
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,890
of the world changes, historiosity

991
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,726
agents change, they learn and they

992
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:11,034
attend, and then the niche changes with

993
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:12,922
stigma g and niche modification. So

994
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,482
because things really do change through

995
00:50:15,536 --> 00:50:19,338
time, then just training a

996
00:50:19,344 --> 00:50:22,794
data set at one time point and

997
00:50:22,832 --> 00:50:26,078
then using that same generative model

998
00:50:26,244 --> 00:50:29,278
and carrying it forward, it's like

999
00:50:29,364 --> 00:50:31,566
picking a speed in a direction when

1000
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:33,566
you're on a winding road and just

1001
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:34,846
saying, all right, now let's turn on

1002
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,786
cruise control right now and just keep

1003
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,162
going in this direction. It's working

1004
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:42,274
right now. So then

1005
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:44,146
to connect that to the legibility of the

1006
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:47,814
forests as the causal model changed and

1007
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:49,126
externalities were not taken into

1008
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:50,726
account and so on, all these different

1009
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,254
features you brought in. So now is

1010
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:56,434
active inference and cognitive modeling,

1011
00:50:56,482 --> 00:50:59,734
cognitive technologies increasing our

1012
00:50:59,772 --> 00:51:03,322
legibility of perception, cognition and

1013
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:06,586
action through surveillance technology

1014
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:10,554
and other mechanisms such that there

1015
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:14,640
could be we expect there to be

1016
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,306
also hidden dynamics

1017
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:23,230
and externalities that we are also

1018
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,686
failing to see when we make some aspects

1019
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:29,714
of cognitive systems legible in the way

1020
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:31,746
that research in the neurosciences is

1021
00:51:31,768 --> 00:51:32,820
happening towards.

1022
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,958
Yeah, I think in the sense if you're

1023
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:39,422
trying to do that, you cannot have a no

1024
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:41,186
like in a model that encompasses

1025
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,578
everything, right, that would be non

1026
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:45,894
informative in terms of when you do

1027
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:49,078
that, you're interested in something,

1028
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:52,746
right? You have one thing in mind when

1029
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:56,026
you're trying to flesh out in terms of

1030
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:59,194
cognitive modeling, how that applies to

1031
00:51:59,232 --> 00:52:01,494
these more all encompassing situations.

1032
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:03,838
I think that's like that model is how

1033
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:05,806
I'm trying to ask this question. So you

1034
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:09,920
can model them in this sliced sense and

1035
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,206
that's what we do as scientists and

1036
00:52:14,228 --> 00:52:17,380
that's how we learn about things. But

1037
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,234
that only way of seeing that very

1038
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,246
specific model is not all encompassing

1039
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:27,618
for all answers. How can you use that

1040
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:30,686
in comparison to other situations?

1041
00:52:30,718 --> 00:52:32,886
So how can you integrate this type of

1042
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:35,846
thing? I don't know. I don't have a

1043
00:52:35,868 --> 00:52:37,718
question and an answer for that. I don't

1044
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:41,610
know if we do have an answer for this

1045
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,426
type of question currently.

1046
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,730
But I think it's a very valid question

1047
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,058
to ask because

1048
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:53,306
also in the terms of sometimes applying

1049
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:57,466
that socially, that sort of raifies

1050
00:52:57,578 --> 00:53:00,014
in a way and then it becomes an

1051
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,394
organizing principle that becomes

1052
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:05,934
somewhat raified. So keep an eye for

1053
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:09,074
these kinds of metaphorical use, like

1054
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:10,850
assuming a little bit that all this talk

1055
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,578
can be metaphorical and it can be

1056
00:53:14,664 --> 00:53:17,346
interesting and useful to catch them out

1057
00:53:17,368 --> 00:53:18,486
in these terms because they don't have

1058
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:20,040
other ways to talk about them.

1059
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:25,110
So how we don't Raify them

1060
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,760
and how they are,

1061
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,306
because I'm

1062
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:34,138
having a hard time to get there, but I

1063
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,482
think I'm making the point of people

1064
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:38,906
criticizing the causal primacy. So when

1065
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:41,674
you reduce these complex systems to one

1066
00:53:41,712 --> 00:53:44,030
single cause, cashing out everything

1067
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,158
that organizes these complex systems in

1068
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:49,920
one primal cause,

1069
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,546
then you are losing the complexity.

1070
00:53:53,738 --> 00:53:56,706
However, if you don't do that, how can

1071
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:59,666
you slice it out to understand the

1072
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:01,634
system? So I think that's the two

1073
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:04,500
tensions here that I'm kind of trying to

1074
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,746
propose as a question instead of an

1075
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:12,594
answer. I don't know if that makes

1076
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:15,174
sense, but are you thinking, yeah, I

1077
00:54:15,212 --> 00:54:17,058
hope. People continue that discussion.

1078
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:18,966
I'm going to build on that just to kind

1079
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:21,686
of maybe circle around that because it's

1080
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:24,230
really important. So in the forestry

1081
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,974
case, the realist perspective,

1082
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:31,338
again using retro casting the way we

1083
00:54:31,424 --> 00:54:33,466
or contemporary discussions, some of

1084
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:34,686
them in the active inference and free

1085
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,034
energy principle space are the realist

1086
00:54:37,162 --> 00:54:41,150
says that region of land is just

1087
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,914
economic potential. It is a natural

1088
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:46,270
resource that becomes a kind of handle.

1089
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,058
The instrumentalist perspective takes a

1090
00:54:49,064 --> 00:54:50,994
step back and says it's as if that piece

1091
00:54:51,032 --> 00:54:54,514
of land is a natural resource. So,

1092
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:56,786
yeah, the territory is indescribable and

1093
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:58,854
there's still a space for mystery. But

1094
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:02,070
then when the proxies come out because

1095
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,320
policies are being selected, the as if

1096
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,726
in some ways carries similar

1097
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:12,518
consequences to the actual and

1098
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:14,406
they may totally agree and the realists

1099
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:16,714
and the instrumentalists might be like,

1100
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:18,586
yeah, it is economic potential or

1101
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:20,266
represents or it could be treated as

1102
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:22,060
such or it could be engaged with as such

1103
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,534
that cognitive diversity can align on

1104
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:29,054
the social policy that then

1105
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,840
connects to these broader social

1106
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,178
questions and histories. And so it's

1107
00:55:35,194 --> 00:55:36,754
kind of interesting, like, what work

1108
00:55:36,872 --> 00:55:38,994
does this instrumentalism do? Like, oh,

1109
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:42,322
it's just a principle. What work

1110
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:44,866
does it do and what doesn't it do? And

1111
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,498
the ways that science and technical

1112
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,418
engineering fields are and aren't

1113
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:53,830
deployed alone or together with

1114
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,334
other considerations. Yeah, that's very

1115
00:55:57,372 --> 00:56:00,246
interesting in the sense I don't know if

1116
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:02,042
you're realist or instrumentalist about

1117
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:04,522
that, if you think models are not either

1118
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:06,086
true or false, they're just models,

1119
00:56:06,118 --> 00:56:08,586
right. They might have used and they

1120
00:56:08,608 --> 00:56:11,846
might be capturing real properties.

1121
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:15,294
But the problem is, in this

1122
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,958
conversation, even when you push them,

1123
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:19,006
like have realists and have an

1124
00:56:19,028 --> 00:56:21,118
instrumentalist try to loosen up a

1125
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:24,894
little bit these assumptions, they still

1126
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:27,010
end up refine those principles and

1127
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,026
taking them to be more or less true or

1128
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:31,906
false. Right? Well, that's kind of a

1129
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:34,094
plot twist. It's like you're appealing

1130
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:37,910
to what surprise, minimization as

1131
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,426
unifying the diversity responses

1132
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,786
that the realist and instrumentalists

1133
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:45,254
do. So then does that make surprise or

1134
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:48,550
cognitive inertia, like the er principle

1135
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:52,646
where the maze just ends and it explains

1136
00:56:52,678 --> 00:56:56,186
itself? Or how does that play in a

1137
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,650
pluralistic scientific setting?

1138
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:00,860
Yeah,

1139
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,920
you can have a third answer to that.

1140
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,006
I think the answer that I'm trying to

1141
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,086
give is more eliminativist in the sense

1142
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:15,742
that eliminates the cause of primacy of

1143
00:57:15,796 --> 00:57:18,830
them, of these two modes of answering.

1144
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,458
I'm thinking I have in mind now,

1145
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:25,618
actually, just to try to make sense of

1146
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:28,014
that. When you think about biological

1147
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:29,282
information, you can think about

1148
00:57:29,336 --> 00:57:31,070
biological information as being real,

1149
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,746
as being metaphorical and instrumental.

1150
00:57:33,938 --> 00:57:36,898
Or you have these guys like Susan Oyama

1151
00:57:36,994 --> 00:57:40,662
or Richard lewantin, they try to bring

1152
00:57:40,716 --> 00:57:42,378
some they are against this cause of

1153
00:57:42,384 --> 00:57:45,260
primacy. They try to advocate for

1154
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,858
systems that do have that, but they have

1155
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:51,286
a lot of more going on. So that cannot

1156
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:54,086
be the only answer because those systems

1157
00:57:54,118 --> 00:57:59,210
are not everywhere scientifically.

1158
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,920
They don't have to be everywhere. That,

1159
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,222
for example, going back to the forestry.

1160
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:11,138
So the realist is going to say that

1161
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:15,986
territory is valued property in

1162
00:58:16,008 --> 00:58:17,698
the sense the instrumental is going to

1163
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:21,174
say, look as if it can be used as

1164
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:23,462
if but it's not necessarily value

1165
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:25,686
property. It doesn't matter. You can say

1166
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:28,920
like, well, this terrain is

1167
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,994
seen from one perspective as value

1168
00:58:32,032 --> 00:58:34,006
property, but it also has other uses

1169
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:35,706
around them. So you had to be more

1170
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:40,266
inclusive of this diversity because the

1171
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:43,022
only organizational principle around

1172
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:46,830
that specific terrain is not only

1173
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,126
to generate value or if it does, this

1174
00:58:50,148 --> 00:58:52,474
value doesn't have one single output.

1175
00:58:52,602 --> 00:58:55,146
It can have more than one output in

1176
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:58,386
terms of very specific terms. You can

1177
00:58:58,408 --> 00:58:59,746
cash it out very materially. This

1178
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:03,410
terrain that has to provide monoculture,

1179
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,346
has to provide also value for the

1180
00:59:07,368 --> 00:59:10,334
diversity of the fauna and the diversity

1181
00:59:10,382 --> 00:59:12,646
of the flora around it. And that is not

1182
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:14,566
included in a model because that's not

1183
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:16,310
what the model is done for. The model

1184
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,320
has a specific use and that's fine.

1185
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,866
However, that does not reduce the

1186
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:23,020
terrain to that.

1187
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,186
Well when you're talking about

1188
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,594
cognition, that might be more

1189
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:31,850
complicated, but I think it's an easy

1190
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,346
way to talk about this cause of primacy

1191
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:38,094
when you talk about forestry because we

1192
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:41,294
are very much now experiencing this

1193
00:59:41,332 --> 00:59:43,102
climate crisis and we see these things

1194
00:59:43,156 --> 00:59:45,694
happening right now and how difficult

1195
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:48,014
because this type of thinking is built

1196
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:51,402
over time and so well fixed

1197
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,782
in the way we see things and we are

1198
00:59:54,836 --> 00:59:56,382
understanding how hard is to change

1199
00:59:56,436 --> 01:00:00,194
that. It not. It's a paradigm shift

1200
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:02,680
that needs to happen for that to change.

1201
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,720
It's not necessarily the model that is

1202
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,454
right or wrong, it's just how you

1203
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:10,120
understand and apply them.

1204
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,838
So there are pragmatics into that. It's

1205
01:00:14,854 --> 01:00:16,650
not only an instrumental, but it has

1206
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,450
something that the instrumentalist take

1207
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,738
does not capture. And I don't know how

1208
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:24,666
to catch it out in one single word, but

1209
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,502
that's what Biosimatics was offering.

1210
01:00:26,566 --> 01:00:29,438
Biosymiatics was offering the idea of

1211
01:00:29,524 --> 01:00:32,014
practice and pragmatics. I don't know if

1212
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:34,880
it's the whole story, but it's another

1213
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,900
point into that story.

1214
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,842
A lot of great points all connect that

1215
01:00:41,896 --> 01:00:45,186
note of pragmatism to a little bit of

1216
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,294
the active inference formalism. So when

1217
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:50,482
it comes to policy selection, behavior

1218
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:53,442
selection, some, but not all cognitive

1219
01:00:53,506 --> 01:00:55,906
entities can act as if they're

1220
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:58,294
calculating expected free energy. So

1221
01:00:58,332 --> 01:01:00,226
these are the active, the truly active

1222
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:01,866
entities, whether they're simple or

1223
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:03,306
whether they're sophisticated and they

1224
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:05,914
do planning expected free energy is how

1225
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:08,746
those agents are being modeled, as if

1226
01:01:08,768 --> 01:01:11,034
they're making decisions. And it

1227
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:12,766
consists of the pragmatic and the

1228
01:01:12,788 --> 01:01:14,126
epistemic value. That's how these

1229
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:16,206
different policies are evaluated. And so

1230
01:01:16,228 --> 01:01:19,658
I see two angles

1231
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:22,990
or windows that that supports,

1232
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,350
at least from my non social sciences

1233
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,058
background, a new kind of meeting in the

1234
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:32,206
middle there. So first is the expansion

1235
01:01:32,238 --> 01:01:34,782
of pragmatic value under the principle

1236
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:37,418
that surprise, minimization or bounding

1237
01:01:37,534 --> 01:01:40,006
is the imperative right there in the

1238
01:01:40,028 --> 01:01:42,182
pragmatic value. It doesn't have to be

1239
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:45,522
just body temperature or financial

1240
01:01:45,586 --> 01:01:49,762
income. We can expect and prefer ourself

1241
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:51,786
to be learning new things or meeting new

1242
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,666
people. And so we can load into the

1243
01:01:54,688 --> 01:01:58,790
pragmatism different goals

1244
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,746
that under a narrower definition of

1245
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:03,818
utility or pragma have not traditionally

1246
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:06,654
been included. So I think that first way

1247
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:10,714
is it speaks to a more inclusive concept

1248
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:12,862
of utility, you might say. I'm also

1249
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:15,966
derisking on forest fires alongside the

1250
01:02:15,988 --> 01:02:18,606
timber and already you have now plural

1251
01:02:18,718 --> 01:02:21,154
pragma. So I think that's the kind of

1252
01:02:21,272 --> 01:02:24,162
crossover and then the deeper and second

1253
01:02:24,216 --> 01:02:25,602
and not saying there's only two ways

1254
01:02:25,656 --> 01:02:27,766
that the conversation continues. We have

1255
01:02:27,788 --> 01:02:30,626
epistemic utility in terms of epistemic

1256
01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:34,006
value and so the balance and the

1257
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:36,406
weighting between pragmatic value and

1258
01:02:36,428 --> 01:02:39,202
epistemic or learning oriented activity

1259
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:43,722
overall helps control a

1260
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:47,642
dynamics balance with just like how

1261
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:50,198
tight is the grip and the preference

1262
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:54,282
overall. And maybe we have some

1263
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:57,306
preference for timber to be exported

1264
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,934
from a region but we really don't know.

1265
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:01,598
We don't have long term modeling, we

1266
01:03:01,604 --> 01:03:03,886
don't have deep causal analysis. And so

1267
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:07,022
we're going to put 5% on the pragmatic

1268
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:10,462
extraction and other pragmatic features

1269
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:14,226
and leave the rest of the policy in an

1270
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:18,194
exploratory mode and come to

1271
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:21,314
a blend that's not just on the spectrum

1272
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:22,966
from explore to exploit, which is how

1273
01:03:22,988 --> 01:03:24,914
this has been approached in cognitive

1274
01:03:24,962 --> 01:03:27,766
sciences previously. It's like this is

1275
01:03:27,788 --> 01:03:30,086
the third thing where policies that are

1276
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,866
on the frontier of exploring and

1277
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:34,986
exploiting rise to the top through their

1278
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:36,886
contributions to pragmatic and epistemic

1279
01:03:36,918 --> 01:03:39,754
value. And we made the model. So that

1280
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,498
isn't to say that that is what's

1281
01:03:42,534 --> 01:03:43,898
happening on the ground or maybe that's

1282
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:45,710
just the instrumentalist perspective.

1283
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,914
Yeah, but if it's an instrumentalist

1284
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,534
perspective, it might be a good one,

1285
01:03:55,572 --> 01:03:57,650
right? In the sense the idea of

1286
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,738
inclusion is kind of the interesting

1287
01:04:00,824 --> 01:04:02,626
one. Right? Because if you refine the

1288
01:04:02,648 --> 01:04:05,026
notion of maximization because you can

1289
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:07,220
use that in certain ways to understand

1290
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,666
what happens within when you're modeling

1291
01:04:09,698 --> 01:04:12,422
something, what is the limit of that

1292
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:15,990
maximization? So you can model agents

1293
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:19,058
as if maximizing utility, for instance.

1294
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,738
But maximizing utility is something that

1295
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,834
needs to be balanced out with utility of

1296
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:29,526
everyone around them. Right? And that's

1297
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:31,962
not trivial how that happens. Right?

1298
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:35,294
And even if it does, and even if it were

1299
01:04:35,332 --> 01:04:39,482
trivial, it's not something that maps

1300
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:43,034
out completely identically

1301
01:04:43,162 --> 01:04:45,120
with every single agent.

1302
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:49,170
There's going to be diversity there. So

1303
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,602
how do you make that notion more

1304
01:04:51,656 --> 01:04:54,834
inclusive and less raified in that

1305
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:56,946
sense? Because then if the more you

1306
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:59,206
Raify, the more you single it out into

1307
01:04:59,308 --> 01:05:02,886
around only one general

1308
01:05:02,988 --> 01:05:05,574
type of understanding. So when you think

1309
01:05:05,612 --> 01:05:09,494
them more individually, then you

1310
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:13,180
lose that strength of this one single

1311
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:17,562
principle organized, one single

1312
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:19,386
way of cashing out utility. That's not

1313
01:05:19,408 --> 01:05:23,262
the principle. Sorry. So I think that

1314
01:05:23,396 --> 01:05:27,040
speaks a lot with the type of

1315
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,822
instrumental use and the type of

1316
01:05:29,876 --> 01:05:33,534
pragmatism, the types of application

1317
01:05:33,652 --> 01:05:36,730
of these practices. Right.

1318
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,302
Remember, in the sense of the scientific

1319
01:05:40,366 --> 01:05:42,594
forestry, it's also a practice. It's not

1320
01:05:42,632 --> 01:05:45,374
something that is true in itself, it's

1321
01:05:45,422 --> 01:05:47,138
true in terms of practice, right, in

1322
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:48,822
terms of applications, in terms of

1323
01:05:48,876 --> 01:05:50,902
building communities around them. So

1324
01:05:50,956 --> 01:05:54,630
without this use they have no grounding.

1325
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:00,906
Yeah, one really strong and

1326
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:03,306
salient point that I got from the

1327
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:05,770
lecture was about generalized synchrony.

1328
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,082
And it's almost funny that we have to

1329
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:11,254
advocate or delineate generalized

1330
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:13,158
synchrony because the alternative, the

1331
01:06:13,184 --> 01:06:16,350
absence of generalized synchrony is just

1332
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,066
like kind of like an ideal gas. It's

1333
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:21,646
like there wouldn't be regularities in

1334
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:23,886
society, we wouldn't be clustered in

1335
01:06:23,988 --> 01:06:26,750
space or in time, we wouldn't have

1336
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,666
information and communication and we

1337
01:06:29,688 --> 01:06:34,066
wouldn't have what differentiates a

1338
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:36,386
society or a group or a civilization or

1339
01:06:36,408 --> 01:06:39,122
a colony or whatever from literally

1340
01:06:39,186 --> 01:06:42,194
anything else. So generalized synchrony

1341
01:06:42,242 --> 01:06:45,400
is almost like all of the space between

1342
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,320
nothing and anything happening

1343
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,826
and then it supports all these different

1344
01:06:52,928 --> 01:06:56,266
scenarios. We could have this kind

1345
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:58,666
of mind in this kind of brain in this

1346
01:06:58,688 --> 01:07:00,186
kind of environment and this kind of

1347
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:03,454
niche. And so we can talk about the ant

1348
01:07:03,492 --> 01:07:05,598
colony foraging algorithms that work in

1349
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,030
the desert and there might be mutual,

1350
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,206
nonexhausted, open ended change of

1351
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,062
algorithms and what works in a different

1352
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:17,666
setting. And with humans we have

1353
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:20,994
the sophistication and the history and

1354
01:07:21,032 --> 01:07:24,322
the scope and the scale and all of these

1355
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:28,550
metas and weaving with is

1356
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,840
and ought and our own forward going

1357
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:37,062
direction, which is really the

1358
01:07:37,116 --> 01:07:38,806
moment where it goes from being a

1359
01:07:38,828 --> 01:07:42,842
forensic sociology to

1360
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:46,714
the real time sense making and

1361
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:50,634
action selection based upon our

1362
01:07:50,752 --> 01:07:53,034
cognitive models. In the broader sense,

1363
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:54,830
which includes humans and non human

1364
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,526
agents. But it's like that's when it

1365
01:07:56,548 --> 01:07:58,574
goes from being more than just an

1366
01:07:58,612 --> 01:08:01,550
understanding, when that understanding

1367
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,414
translates to an action policy and they

1368
01:08:04,452 --> 01:08:08,606
do, then it matters

1369
01:08:08,638 --> 01:08:10,820
as much as anything does.

1370
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,046
Yeah. One of the criticism of the active

1371
01:08:16,078 --> 01:08:18,534
inference, I think common is like it is

1372
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:22,614
too general to single out specific

1373
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:25,270
constraints that orient action.

1374
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:28,134
That's what I thought thinking about how

1375
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:31,802
symbols are brought about in

1376
01:08:31,856 --> 01:08:34,330
community of language users,

1377
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,330
assuming that the symbols are not they

1378
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,610
are only meaningful throughout these

1379
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,920
histories and practices can help us to

1380
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:53,966
apply this type of general yeah,

1381
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:55,600
navigating specific,

1382
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,314
well, epistemic communities. And I think

1383
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:01,714
that's the work that Maho is going to

1384
01:09:01,752 --> 01:09:03,486
bring along in terms of epistemic

1385
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:05,298
communities and then you single out in

1386
01:09:05,304 --> 01:09:07,940
them. So you have these communities of

1387
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:11,126
language users in which specific

1388
01:09:11,228 --> 01:09:15,430
practices create specific orientations.

1389
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,570
Yeah. One thought on that asking

1390
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,026
like what does active inference or

1391
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:27,158
linear regression or some other method

1392
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:29,402
again, this is who knows, is this just

1393
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:32,198
deep esoteric instrumentalism?

1394
01:09:32,374 --> 01:09:34,314
But asking what does it have to say

1395
01:09:34,352 --> 01:09:36,138
about this symbol? What does active

1396
01:09:36,154 --> 01:09:38,222
inference have to say about the letter E

1397
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:41,694
in English? Can it be

1398
01:09:41,732 --> 01:09:43,166
as simple as to say that that's a

1399
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:45,534
category error and that you could make a

1400
01:09:45,572 --> 01:09:47,650
toy example or a pedagogical example

1401
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,666
where symbol one and symbol two

1402
01:09:49,848 --> 01:09:53,154
oscillate in a multi agent simulation or

1403
01:09:53,192 --> 01:09:54,978
you could make a generative model for an

1404
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:57,138
alphabet and leave it abstract. But

1405
01:09:57,224 --> 01:09:59,126
you're never going to connect to the

1406
01:09:59,148 --> 01:10:02,406
historiosity and the real enactment of

1407
01:10:02,428 --> 01:10:05,394
the English letter E unless you're

1408
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:08,946
confronting the minute particulars

1409
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:12,074
and the actual embodiment of that

1410
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:14,554
letter. And then there's different

1411
01:10:14,592 --> 01:10:16,054
course grainings, different iterated

1412
01:10:16,102 --> 01:10:17,770
modeling decisions, different questions

1413
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,774
about how do you include and participate

1414
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:21,946
in the different stages of the

1415
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,606
scientific process. But it's like you're

1416
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:26,538
in the specifics at that point, active

1417
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:28,558
inference doesn't have an opinion on the

1418
01:10:28,564 --> 01:10:30,654
letter E because we wouldn't want it to.

1419
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,446
It would be too opinionated about the

1420
01:10:32,468 --> 01:10:34,510
wrong things. It'd be making assumptions

1421
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,210
and bringing axioms into play that would

1422
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,946
be extremely constraining and

1423
01:10:42,968 --> 01:10:46,866
so it remains general as a framework and

1424
01:10:46,888 --> 01:10:49,566
the free energy principle even more

1425
01:10:49,688 --> 01:10:52,246
differently. So but when we get into the

1426
01:10:52,268 --> 01:10:53,958
actual, that's where we're connecting to

1427
01:10:53,964 --> 01:10:56,326
the real systems of interest. But how

1428
01:10:56,348 --> 01:10:59,174
could we make claims and advance them

1429
01:10:59,212 --> 01:11:02,074
socially about systems of interest when

1430
01:11:02,112 --> 01:11:03,798
we're not even it's like comparing

1431
01:11:03,894 --> 01:11:06,122
bridge building as a concept with this

1432
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:09,322
bridge right here. It's a little bit

1433
01:11:09,376 --> 01:11:12,730
like a category disconnect.

1434
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:19,326
Yeah, well, it depends also how you

1435
01:11:19,348 --> 01:11:22,218
single out some things. You just don't

1436
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:23,374
do that because they're just not

1437
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,326
interesting enough. Right. There's

1438
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:29,346
nothing that comes out of it in

1439
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:32,514
terms of this bridge right here in a

1440
01:11:32,552 --> 01:11:37,666
single how did you put it again? Like a

1441
01:11:37,688 --> 01:11:39,522
category of bridges and this bridge

1442
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:42,598
right here, right when you do that you

1443
01:11:42,604 --> 01:11:44,914
can learn something about the category

1444
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:47,880
in terms of this single one right here.

1445
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:52,742
But it's not exhaustive that's

1446
01:11:52,806 --> 01:11:54,854
I think one point it's not exhaustive

1447
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:57,050
and it's not right or wrong. It might be

1448
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,146
better than other I

1449
01:12:01,168 --> 01:12:04,334
think they did you can make some

1450
01:12:04,372 --> 01:12:06,346
comparisons in terms of predictive

1451
01:12:06,378 --> 01:12:09,102
value. You can have better or worse ways

1452
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:11,614
of doing it and then it gains more

1453
01:12:11,652 --> 01:12:15,274
utility. Okay, connecting this to

1454
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:19,854
also this non exhaustive nature

1455
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:22,174
and where the power of a generalizable

1456
01:12:22,222 --> 01:12:23,986
framework is let's talk about the

1457
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:27,038
category of Golden Gate Bridges in San

1458
01:12:27,054 --> 01:12:29,618
Francisco. So there's only one actual

1459
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:32,278
bridge there, but we're generalizing it.

1460
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:35,446
And so somebody makes a state space and

1461
01:12:35,468 --> 01:12:36,806
says well, I'm exploring if there was

1462
01:12:36,828 --> 01:12:39,506
more than two end to end. So they're

1463
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:41,314
exploring the state space of topologies

1464
01:12:41,362 --> 01:12:42,658
of bridge and someone else is exploring

1465
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:44,682
the state space of color and somebody

1466
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,586
else is exploring the state space of

1467
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:48,074
traffic dynamics and someone else is

1468
01:12:48,112 --> 01:12:49,706
combining two of them or combining all

1469
01:12:49,728 --> 01:12:51,706
three of them. And then that's the

1470
01:12:51,728 --> 01:12:54,702
conversation is which map of this

1471
01:12:54,756 --> 01:12:56,830
category of state spaces,

1472
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:01,070
category of adjacent possibles as we

1473
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,186
chose to model it. And if you don't

1474
01:13:04,218 --> 01:13:05,866
include traffic flow, don't be surprised

1475
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:07,266
that it's not going to take that kind of

1476
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:09,150
data or make that kind of prediction.

1477
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,842
And some variables matter and some

1478
01:13:11,896 --> 01:13:14,030
matter in combination and some don't.

1479
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:17,486
But when we model, we kind of build

1480
01:13:17,608 --> 01:13:21,830
these regions or adjacencies

1481
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:25,094
to the actual which is where the

1482
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:27,560
historiosity of the past leaves us.

1483
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,962
And then we have an adjacent possible as

1484
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:35,494
modelers and sense makers including

1485
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:39,158
absurd counterfactuals and state spaces

1486
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:42,650
and then the state spaces are mobilized.

1487
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,930
Yeah, in a way. But if you talk about

1488
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:52,256
specific type of engineering yes, in

1489
01:13:52,278 --> 01:13:54,816
that sense they are mobilized and they

1490
01:13:54,838 --> 01:13:57,324
are not true or false. You can use false

1491
01:13:57,372 --> 01:13:59,570
models that still function.

1492
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,724
You can have specific uses of things

1493
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:06,420
that you know they're not really true.

1494
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:11,008
Like the thing, the taleric

1495
01:14:11,184 --> 01:14:12,580
type of modeling,

1496
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,944
the solar system, they still use that to

1497
01:14:17,982 --> 01:14:20,228
navigate in the desert even though it's

1498
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:22,296
not really accurate. But if you want to

1499
01:14:22,318 --> 01:14:24,910
go from A to B, it helps you to do that,

1500
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,950
that's a different thing. Right.

1501
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,668
It's not true or false, but when you

1502
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:34,252
think about agents in terms of and if

1503
01:14:34,306 --> 01:14:38,444
bringing back to the idea of symbols

1504
01:14:38,492 --> 01:14:40,432
being only cashed out in terms of

1505
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:42,800
community of users that have histories

1506
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,944
and they are made useful, they are made

1507
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,740
meaningful in terms of their practices,

1508
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,204
then you don't have ever this

1509
01:14:51,242 --> 01:14:54,196
disconnect, right? You can think about

1510
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:56,564
this cognition is always connected to

1511
01:14:56,602 --> 01:14:59,316
this specific types of practicing. You

1512
01:14:59,338 --> 01:15:02,330
can even single out some moments of it

1513
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,576
and try to see what you learn from this

1514
01:15:05,678 --> 01:15:07,450
kind of slice of time.

1515
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,632
But when you think about the whole story

1516
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:13,836
of the cognitive system, if you're going

1517
01:15:13,858 --> 01:15:17,084
to really think of it in terms that is

1518
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:21,356
valuable, you cannot disconnect from the

1519
01:15:21,378 --> 01:15:24,392
state, let's say the state space of its

1520
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:25,600
practice.

1521
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,410
Awesome. Well.

1522
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:36,012
Do you have any closing thoughts

1523
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:38,236
or what are you looking forward to with

1524
01:15:38,278 --> 01:15:40,196
the discussion section and the rest of

1525
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:42,596
the course? Just by way of wrapping up

1526
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:45,012
and letting people know? Any other

1527
01:15:45,066 --> 01:15:48,640
thoughts? Yeah, would be cool to explore

1528
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,616
this idea that we've been actually

1529
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:53,544
bringing along here, right? How we can

1530
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,492
go with that instrumentally,

1531
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:59,048
realistically or how can we understand

1532
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:02,476
this general synchronization of the

1533
01:16:02,498 --> 01:16:04,590
model in terms of specific

1534
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,704
instantiations and how informative

1535
01:16:09,752 --> 01:16:11,804
they are? Is that really interesting?

1536
01:16:11,922 --> 01:16:15,132
Or how can these things

1537
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:19,084
be actually raised in terms of modeling?

1538
01:16:19,132 --> 01:16:21,984
And if that happens, does that have any

1539
01:16:22,022 --> 01:16:24,736
specific consequences actually or not?

1540
01:16:24,838 --> 01:16:25,810
Maybe not.

1541
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:31,902
Awesome. Well, very ambitious

1542
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:34,146
and excellent lecture. So thank you very

1543
01:16:34,168 --> 01:16:36,660
much Lorena, and talk to you.

1544
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,986
Just keep in mind I was just like trying

1545
01:16:40,008 --> 01:16:41,654
to ask these questions. I don't also

1546
01:16:41,692 --> 01:16:45,030
have those answers. I found very little

1547
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,630
about active inference and semiotics

1548
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:52,434
produced. I found a few papers.

1549
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,446
So that's very exploratory actually. So

1550
01:16:55,468 --> 01:16:57,542
you're invited to think of these things

1551
01:16:57,596 --> 01:16:59,542
and explore a little bit them further if

1552
01:16:59,596 --> 01:17:03,718
it's possible. Cool. Epic. All right.

1553
01:17:03,884 --> 01:17:05,206
Thank you, Lauren. I see you in a couple

1554
01:17:05,228 --> 01:17:07,546
of weeks. Farewell. Ciao.
