6830	7250	1	A	0.73926	All right.
7320	8820	2	A	0.99998	Hello and welcome everyone.
9190	14178	3	A	1	This is the course “Active inference for the social sciences” in 2023.
14344	18418	4	A	0.3841	It's August 30, or maybe a different date, depending on where you are.
18584	22590	5	A	1	And today we're in the semiotics and semantics section.
22750	29318	6	A	0.95565	We'll be hearing a lecture from Lorena Sganzerla, and then we're going to have a little bit of a discussion.
29414	34810	7	A	0.99202	So, Lorena, thank you a lot for joining and off to you for the lecture.
36350	38460	8	B	0.6213	Okay, hello, everyone.
39970	42170	9	B	0.49307	I'm based in Australia.
42250	43322	10	B	0.91469	Yeah, I'm Lorena.
43386	46800	11	B	0.67047	I'm doing actually my PhD in philosophy here.
47330	49834	12	B	0.45892	We work in cognitive sciences and philosophy.
49882	53300	13	B	0.64	I work with concepts and notions of information.
54150	64614	14	B	0.99995	So I'm very interested in foundational understanding of cognitive sciences and information and how these kind of things cash out.
64812	75686	15	B	1	And this is why I was interested in talking about semantics and social cognition to see how these things cash out.
75708	91662	16	B	0.66	I have a few ideas on how semiotics can be compatible with, like, active inference, and I try to organize a little bit of this semiotic notion and active inference to see if they pan out.
91796	92730	17	B	0.99998	Maybe they don't.
92810	94560	18	B	0.99988	So let's see how it goes.
96610	101230	19	B	0.99908	So let's talk about active inference, formal semantics, and social cognition.
104930	105920	20	B	0.91533	What's up?
107090	109826	21	B	0.9638	Okay, I cannot move my Lloyds now.
109848	110580	22	B	0.89	I can.
111350	118370	23	B	0.98278	So I will first have a very short introduction for you guys I have out here.
118440	119278	24	B	0.99951	So what are you going to do?
119304	120658	25	B	0.75053	Like, we have a short introduction.
120754	133498	26	B	0.48055	I'm going to talk a little bit of theories of meaning, and then we're going to talk a little bit the free energy principle and active inference and how shared symbols and social cognition can be thought together.
133664	138410	27	B	1	I bring one case that I find interesting and then we draw some conclusions.
138850	146190	28	B	0.96881	So let me know what you think in the comments and after we can have a little discussion or in the next session.
148050	159922	29	B	0.68246	So the background introduction that I want to first point to is we are talking about biological agents and how they act.
160056	177450	30	B	0.99999	So we are always thinking in terms of biological agents acting to express in ways that express informational sensitivities to context dependent relevance to their environment and things that involve communities.
177790	195242	31	B	1	However, how this very minimal way of talking about what motivates and what is relevant to people becomes stable enough as a self sustaining pattern of interactions, like, are they stable and how they become that stable?
195306	210350	32	B	0.9955	So how can those information sensitivities ground values, norms, and goals consistently and over time, assuming that those values and goals are necessary for meaningful interactions?
210510	214066	33	B	0.99934	So we have to align motivations to behavior, right?
214088	215390	34	B	0.90621	That's not really obvious.
215560	220294	35	B	0.99	And ultimately how meaning is brought about.
220492	228700	36	B	1	I don't think I'm going to answer that, but I want to point to some directions and how people have been thinking about these questions over time.
231150	234554	37	B	0.99913	So the problem of meaning has a brief account, right?
234592	250400	38	B	0.99087	Like, traditionally approaches of to cognition, localize meaning inside individual organisms and more specifically, inside their minds so meaning pertains to content in this kind of thing.
252150	260654	39	B	0.99994	However, like many have a developmental history so it's hard to catch those two things together if it's inside people's minds.
260782	276870	40	B	0.99999	How we can have an evolutionary and developmental history assuming that meanings are things that we can learn over time and they happen in shared context, they don't happen out of nowhere in a vision, from nowhere.
278590	298158	41	B	0.99997	In a sense we can say that it's not really trivial that conventionalized words like for example, the conventionalized meaning of a word, for instance, catch means catch, have evolutionary histories one thing does not come from the other.
298324	305106	42	B	0.99999	We need a broader understanding to cash this meaning out and that's where I'm stepping from.
305208	306878	43	B	0.83293	That's my grounding.
306974	316454	44	B	0.99962	We need to cast these things out in terms of community of language users which brings a problem, right?
316492	322546	45	B	0.99274	We have goals and values that can be defined in terms of those communities and you have material embodied factors.
322658	334060	46	B	0.99997	So how these two things are together or how goals and values affect and motivate material and embodied agents?
336270	341760	47	B	1	To answer this kind of question, like over time, there are a few preferred ways.
342370	351210	48	B	0.98	I will do a brief overview of some theories of meaning usually in terms of cognitive sciences and any philosophy of mind.
351380	355122	49	B	0.96208	That's what I'm interested in how they cast it out.
355176	376230	50	B	0.99987	They usually try to think of those things in terms of syntax like concerns with form as an abstract organizing kind of rule is a type of grammar and how the order of things and how the logical unfolding of those symbols, how they become meaningful.
377550	382134	51	B	0.69245	But the syntax itself is not really enough to cash out meaning in semantics.
382262	391626	52	B	0.999	So then in that sense syntax evolve into a field that we call semantics, in which meaning and mental content are organized.
391738	410420	53	B	0.6609	Throughout this instructional syntax then we have propositional knowledge and truth conditions in which allows these organizational story of meaningful words to make sense and they're going to point out into the outside world.
410790	418194	54	B	0.55	And we have a third option it's not so new, but it's not so famous, which is semantics.
418242	421270	55	B	0.70241	Or more importantly, I will focus on biosemantics.
423290	439870	56	B	0.62408	It concerns with the use of symbols like how they bring about meaning in terms of pragmatics and that will be a little bit different and we'll catch it out in different terms in relation to its peers like semantics and syntax.
440370	443534	57	B	0.9212	Well, syntax is pretty clear in terms of being rules, right?
443572	446238	58	B	0.99998	So what is semantics talk about?
446324	459070	59	B	0.99313	So talk about mental content, about intentionality, about mental representations in the sense we have semantics that have specific key concepts that reference truth conditions and denotation.
459230	465734	60	B	0.99995	So if you have mental content and if you put these meanings inside the organism, it has to refer to something else.
465772	469206	61	B	1	And how this cognitive penetration happens.
469308	475078	62	B	0.96434	Like, how can meaning come about inside the mind?
475164	486682	63	B	1	And how that refers to something outside in the world and how this observational viewpoint of you thinking about something in front of you can be actually true.
486736	513358	64	B	0.99999	So we need truth conditions that denote this specific relationship and that is represented in terms of mental content contemporarily there's like various ways of catching this out that can be functional, that can be more internalized mental specific types of representations grounded in vehicles.
513374	516422	65	B	0.50456	It's a very rich discussion and I don't want to go into all that.
516476	533894	66	B	0.59	I just want to point it out that science and neuroscience use those terms to study and to build models that relate to mental representations in terms of neuro representations because it kind of makes sense for us like brain activity.
533942	546222	67	B	0.94257	You can see them in terms of what happens by studying human beings and by studying animals and how these mental representations relate to something that happens in the world.
546276	559726	68	B	0.60827	You can see that one behavior elicits specific activities and they have a correlational relationship and that is highly debated.
559838	560786	69	B	0.99996	But there we go.
560808	577690	70	B	0.47031	We have many types of cashing out neural representations and concerning to this relationship of stimuli and the interpretation of this stimuli and how they motivate action.
579550	590650	71	B	0.54978	That's already a very much weaker claim in relation to mental content and things being inside organisms but it is still in the same line of reasoning.
591870	608814	72	B	0.99	And there is also biosemiotics which I want to focus a little bit more because it concerns the use and the interpretation of signs and symbols which also emphasizes the embodied nature and the situated nature of meaning.
608942	615640	73	B	0.99998	So you don't have meaning without those practices and without the use of embodied agents.
616490	626594	74	B	0.99982	So we have to reject the idea that meaning are abstract symbols or they going to be something that has to be in your mind and refer to something outside.
626732	642638	75	B	0.45597	They're going to only exist in this type of relationship and they can take many forms including chemical signals like visual clues, behavior, words like the word cat you can have how you organize the word cat.
642724	646750	76	B	0.69435	They are all symbolic and that fits also in that kind of structure.
647090	663842	77	B	0.99989	So they are very important for communication, obviously because we do communicate in terms of pointing to the same shared notions of symbols in words and also other types of symbolic meaning and we coordinate life around them.
663896	674690	78	B	0.99966	So living systems are then here characterized by the biosemite semiotics, by their ability of creating and interpreting and using these symbols in terms of their practices.
674850	690314	79	B	1	The fathers of biosemiotics started probably in the 19th century and Ox Cole is one of the most famous representatives.
690442	698830	80	B	0.99787	Currently you can find new authors like Hoffman, Maya or Baker.
700530	719922	81	B	0.99469	So I tried to organize a little bit in a specific model, in a type of model, in a visual story, how these two types of understanding meaning are being applied in terms of theories of meaning historically.
720066	727366	82	B	0.99964	So in biosemiotics we have the pragmatics and you have the practice and they relate to dynamics and context dependent.
727478	745430	83	B	0.99987	So you can see here on the top of the screen how agent we have the agent relationship with its psychological and social aspects and biosemiotics is somewhat concerned how correlation leads to prediction and beliefs and that leads to expectations.
745590	763140	84	B	1	And we also have other types of theories like telesymantics and and theories of computational syntax that tries to understand the dynamics and the mechanism of this relationship.
765210	769560	85	B	0.71	And they are not really crossing each other.
772410	775158	86	B	0.90421	They're not talking about the same necessary things.
775244	777900	87	B	0.99999	So how can these things be brought together?
779470	791450	88	B	0.99974	That's when I was thinking how we can bring this free energy principle and active inference in terms of those relationships.
793310	802430	89	B	0.83	The free energy principle and active inference, as we know and I have been talking about probably in the past two classes.
803010	807550	90	B	0.71822	It's a model that is interesting for that because it has like very minimal assumptions.
807710	815782	91	B	0.99995	So it starts off from the idea that organisms act to maintain themselves in their expected biological and cognitive states.
815916	826120	92	B	0.99996	So you're always talking, you're modeling and using these mathematicals to ground biological agents in a very embodied sense.
826910	830218	93	B	0.65	And they do so by minimizing their free energy.
830304	830746	94	B	0.99983	Right?
830848	838902	95	B	0.62274	So they have these metabolical states that have to be minimized in terms of expenditure, in terms of uncertainty.
838966	847102	96	B	0.99909	Given that the long term average of free energy is entropy, they want to minimize their uncertainty in terms of their metabolical states.
847156	854622	97	B	0.99908	What that entails that they have a specific range of states they want to stay in, like minimally to stay alive.
854686	863582	98	B	1	To stay alive, you have to do a bunch of things as a human being, but every single embodied agent would you prefer to stay alive?
863646	887098	99	B	0.99986	So there are some preferred basic states that we've defined how action will be take first to maintain metabolical states and how that coordinate with the environment, which entails that organisms and agents can be described in those terms.
887184	907890	100	B	0.94156	Like an active inference tries to bring out those minimal assumptions in mathematical terms that try to express how reducing the probability of these non anticipated states or states that are not favorable to maintaining their minimal metabolical needs will be reduced.
908230	908642	101	B	0.86018	Right?
908696	932490	102	B	1	And that can be catched in terms of a generative model, as we've been saying throughout the past actions, how this generative model sets specific times and organizes around specific parameters that can be described as trying to maintain those parameters within reasonable range.
933470	941510	103	B	0.99969	So by minimizing free energy on average and over time, this system will self organize.
941590	948462	104	B	0.99997	So we will bring out the parameters of its internal states that occupy a limited number of possible states.
948516	961406	105	B	0.56268	We will set into a specific range that will then be then will be used as somewhat the base and the guide for this behavior.
961518	967554	106	B	0.99995	You have two kinds of dynamics happening here, right?
967672	969814	107	B	0.99997	That's what I want to talk about a little bit.
969932	977634	108	B	0.99958	So we have then a phenotype that exists in a specific type of states, but that will have to coordinate two different kinds of dynamics.
977682	981338	109	B	0.5528	They're going to be stated here as complementary, right?
981424	984054	110	B	0.99997	You have flow states and have belief updating.
984182	1011490	111	B	0.82831	So with flow states you have one type of modeling which is the known equilibrium steady states that we use intrinsic is named here intrinsic information geometry and you have belief updating that can be treated as extrinsic informational geometry and those are different types of modeling or different types of thinking about those processes that's most important, right?
1011640	1020882	112	B	0.99991	So in terms of flow states we can talk about dynamical system and how you settle and self organize specific parameters.
1020946	1047150	113	B	0.89	And in terms of belief updating we will be talking about Bayesian mathematics and Bayesian cognition and specific ways of cashing out how an agent will change and behave over time in relation to the dynamics that is set into place in this state space of possible actions.
1049570	1063854	114	B	0.99987	So while dynamical systems will explore temporal and contextual, dependence between environment and agent will set this specific state space that has temporal dimension and has contextual dimension.
1063982	1078502	115	B	1	And once this state space is sort of established, we have more or less deterministic approach to what can possibly unfold.
1078566	1100186	116	B	0.9999	So how changes and how behavior can be cashed out in terms of nondeterministic behavior and that is defined by the different type of probabilistic thinking which is the Bayesian mechanics of belief, of belief updating.
1100298	1111540	117	B	0.99977	So we have then a process of belief updating throughout weighted interactions within this range of possible states.
1111910	1121030	118	B	0.99972	So we do have dynamics and we do also have biasian process unfolding together in terms of mechanisms.
1122570	1132490	119	B	1	And with that we do have mathematical statements providing a unifying perspective on formal approaches connecting behavior and dynamics.
1132910	1149242	120	B	0.99989	So that's what active inference should be bringing about as a novelty in relation to older forms of understanding organisms which can either cash things out in term of behavior or in terms of dynamics.
1149386	1157250	121	B	0.99996	So trying to bring these two things together is quite interesting to understand how symbols and what is semantics for instance?
1157750	1162434	122	B	0.93335	So that's the question I will be asking right now.
1162552	1164600	123	B	0.99709	Let's talk a little bit about that.
1165690	1183290	124	B	0.99435	I'm drawing here from quite interesting paper from Maxwell Ramstead and in politely is free energy principle a principle for formal semantics?
1183630	1186262	125	B	0.63354	So what would be formal semantics?
1186326	1189774	126	B	0.99984	It sounds like an oxymoron, right?
1189812	1192894	127	B	0.99992	Like how semantics can be formal, how can you formalize it?
1192932	1195678	128	B	0.99889	So semantics, the theory of meaningful things.
1195844	1198960	129	B	0.99987	So how can that be empty of content?
1200050	1210370	130	B	0.9988	Well, it has a few principles in which you can explain what formal semantics should how a formal semantics should be understood.
1210950	1223206	131	B	1	First off, we have Bayesian formalism that does not necessarily have to commit to classical notions of representations which are propositional in nature, have propositional semantic content.
1223308	1231894	132	B	0.99956	So the idea is that you can use the notion of a representation in a way that is not necessarily contentful.
1231942	1233866	133	B	0.99917	So how that's going to be?
1234048	1238422	134	B	0.99998	So under the free energy principle, representations can be formal.
1238486	1270470	135	B	0.8722	That's the argument they are bringing under the physics of flow, specifically dynamical system theories and information geometry you can have these mathematical statements that only represent possible specific ways of interacting, how these correlations will affect each other over time in this variational base type of cashing out mathematical functionals.
1272090	1277942	136	B	0.99999	In this sense, we can talk about representational, how they can be understood under this formalism.
1278006	1289122	137	B	1	And what they are saying is they are best understood as internal structures that enable the system to parse out their sensory sensitivities or the sensory streams.
1289286	1303750	138	B	0.8385	So to organize them in specific parameters and also in the terms of their own Markov blankets in their blanket states, which is interesting here.
1303820	1326570	139	B	0.70824	What is the new genealogy of this paper is that grounding a mathematical model in these mathematical properties of the system will avoid grounding these properties in terms of the properties of symbols and thematics in abstract or subjective notions of meaning, but impossible ranges of action.
1328130	1351886	140	B	0.82098	So summing up, what we had before was a type of computational model that had specific components that does not allow for the intelligibility intelligibility of a cognitive component which is intention, which is motivation, context, brain, computer metaphors.
1351998	1361766	141	B	0.99997	We have neuro and cognitive activity often seen as a transfer of symbolic information and cognition, then a snapshot of this transfer.
1361868	1374090	142	B	0.99982	So it's totally dependent of that kind of symbolical transfer which is really difficult to explain how that's going to be biologically plausible and there's a lot of effort trying to do that.
1374160	1382606	143	B	0.99996	So if you're interested in this, there's a very vast wealth of literature but they have to answer to this problem.
1382788	1400786	144	B	0.99843	So how the mind and brain needs to produce an impromptu response to inputs of the external environment all the time and the idea of this formal semantics the authors is trying to explain is trying to include this component into the model.
1400888	1408070	145	B	0.99991	So you have a deflationary model about content, so you have a formal semantics, you have semantics without content.
1408220	1415598	146	B	0.99953	Interestingly and formulated as a variation of free energy functional.
1415714	1451560	147	B	0.767	So those structures that embody those process correspond to states in the system and we also have the biological component that can be formalized in terms of disturb informational geometry that these two densities do probabilistic densities, one from the dynamics and one from the Bay agent describing behavior and now what?
1451630	1455648	148	B	0.99958	So how can active inference be compatible to biosematics?
1455684	1459180	149	B	0.99998	Can it be actually compatible or is it even necessary?
1461840	1489508	150	B	0.9899	Well, active inference is a very general framework and then it does not really give us the tools to understand how encoding can happen in terms of symbols, like how they can be broadcasted into collective action because prediction alone does not explain how do they come about.
1489594	1509836	151	B	0.84116	So in this sense we do have meaningful correlations that refer to the dynamics of one or two or more systems in terms of informational geometry that needs to be cached out with predictive value.
1509938	1513870	152	B	0.99998	So how is this possible?
1516080	1519724	153	B	0.99972	Well, we can talk about that in terms of shared attention.
1519852	1524480	154	B	0.67369	That's one form of this kind of model to cash this out.
1524550	1531504	155	B	0.99943	So we have active inference capturing relevant statistical relations between environment and aging.
1531632	1552200	156	B	1	And why I'm trying to think about here is how biosyniotics offer tools for these informational sensitivities and statistical relations to cache symbols in terms of use and interpretation within communities of language users.
1556400	1560072	157	B	1	And that can only happen in the sense via directed action.
1560136	1588660	158	B	0.99998	So the problem now will turn into how is it possible to specify the factors that are sufficient to constrain action and direct that into specific interaction fault is through the history interaction fault is European forestry.
1589000	1608052	159	B	0.68357	I'm picking this example from a very like from James, I really recommend kind of tells this story about how coordinated action, how states coordinate specific collective actions.
1608196	1610060	160	B	0.99923	But that's not the point that I want to talk here.
1610130	1619200	161	B	0.99943	So here, let's unfold that a little bit in terms of the design of scientific forestry and think about scientific forestry as a practice.
1619940	1672200	162	B	1	And a practice that has an organizing principle that will like that will be the main important articulating story that can connect together how agriculture layouts plantations in specific ways and how collective farms will make specific choices in terms of this organization and how villages can structure themselves around one specific notion or one specific organizational principle and how everything can be calculated to make one type of practice, which is agriculture is a very general, more legible and more manipulable for different kinds of communities.
1672360	1682304	163	B	0.90709	So in that we will involve manipulating the very concrete aspects of the land, the terrain, the products, the workforce.
1682432	1691510	164	B	0.99992	So it has a very encompassing effect over time and in a very concrete sense.
1693340	1706004	165	B	0.99	And interestingly when you talk about European forestry and how European forestry was modeling the terrain and how it's catching out value of these terrains.
1706132	1722432	166	B	0.56655	They were not trying to do that to successfully depict the full range of diversity of the actual social activity and the actual activity of agriculture or the richness of the vegetation or they are not even trying.
1722486	1724016	167	B	0.56051	They didn't intend to do that.
1724038	1730370	168	B	0.54799	That was not the point of this kind of modeling turned into a practice, right?
1730920	1741060	169	B	0.94512	Those models generally represent specific slices of nature that were interesting for one specific official observer.
1741480	1758700	170	B	1	And that point is really important because that will shape how all these communities and how the terrain and how the forest will unfold over time within this specific perspective.
1759680	1769570	171	B	0.99896	So I bring here a quote that I really really like because it tries to flesh this out in simple terms and very useful ones.
1770580	1791780	172	B	0.99974	So, thinking that exaggerating only slightly, one might say that the interest in forest was resolved through one fiscal specific single number, which was the revenue that yield from the timber that was extracted annually.
1792440	1797528	173	B	0.99995	Well, that's okay, that's understandable, that's intelligible and that happens to you every day.
1797614	1813340	174	B	0.99317	In terms of how we understand our economy but what is interesting about this quote is that the best way to appreciate how heroic was this constriction of vision is to notice what falls outside the field of vision.
1814240	1831456	175	B	0.99993	So what is missing from that is not the organizational principle of timber being valuable but everything that was not there or was being excluded treason bushes and planters and plants that hold little to non potential for that purpose.
1831568	1837920	176	B	0.9999	So missing out of that is floridiversity foliage, fruits, et cetera, twigs and branches.
1838000	1840704	177	B	0.99995	Missing out of that are insects and small animals.
1840752	1855128	178	B	0.99992	Depending on this diversity, all this ecological organization falls out of the organizational principle and that has very concrete consequences that we still suffer.
1855184	1865772	179	B	0.47118	Her we still live in the height of this climate crisis that also starts from this kind of thinking.
1865906	1887430	180	B	0.99989	So it has really very material consequences for us and had for them at the time, if you read more about it, that a timber, by trimming and domesticating nature, so much decreased in quality and then eventually decreased in value, which prompted them to try to reorganize that kind of story.
1888840	1889396	181	B	1	And what?
1889418	1894216	182	B	0.88	I want to call attention with the example is that also it brings some specific ways of talking about it.
1894238	1900612	183	B	0.53677	It brings vocabulary that only exists in terms of this type of practice specifically.
1900756	1908524	184	B	0.99997	So this vocabulary constrains nature in a way by pruning what cannot be used.
1908722	1916940	185	B	0.95639	So it generates more than a legible nature, but a way of making nature intelligible and intelligible in a very specific certain way.
1917090	1922896	186	B	0.94	And we make that happen in terms of symbolizing things in specific terms.
1923078	1925504	187	B	0.99999	But the symbols, they don't exist in themselves.
1925622	1930964	188	B	0.99999	They exist only in organizing the social practice around them.
1931082	1937476	189	B	0.99995	So when you replace nature with a term called natural resources, we are doing exactly that.
1937658	1950072	190	B	0.72168	It's specifying from a generalized notion of nature like flora and fauna becomes something valuable, becomes a commodity but not everything, right?
1950126	1953332	191	B	0.58539	It trims the practice.
1953476	1956248	192	B	0.98272	It separates competing species from value goods.
1956264	1963896	193	B	0.99953	So plants are symbolized as crops and the competing species are symbolized as weeds.
1963928	1975730	194	B	0.99999	They are not necessarily crops or weeds or anything like that in nature, but they are that for the way we talk like that because we practice agriculture in a certain way.
1977380	1982080	195	B	0.98423	That's the same for insects or small animals that consume these interesting crops.
1982240	2007032	196	B	0.9975	So the material effect of that and how that only gains traction in the practice over time and how you have specific intention that has unintended consequences are necessarily here situated contextualized and embodied in terms of trimming specific types of attention.
2007176	2040070	197	B	1	And this attention will only shift to try to repopulate infect population, for instance, when you realize that this practice brought this specific effect in a certain way that affects the value of our understanding of nature and that generates exactly a type of social coherence and social coordination and how constraints create this coherence, right?
2043020	2050020	198	B	0.61182	Well now let's talk back again about formal semantics.
2050100	2066300	199	B	0.66995	While this formal semantics and active inference sort of embeds one type of mathematical formalism symbols can only be grounded in specific concrete practices or inaction.
2066640	2080624	200	B	0.99996	So while active inference can be used as a tool to explain social understanding, it does do that in terms of generalized synchronization in a model of cognition that can be inactive and dynamic.
2080672	2084944	201	B	0.66144	But this is still very general in terms of biosematics.
2084992	2102628	202	B	0.99971	We can think of it as a framework that might be compatible with active inference in terms of explaining the materiality of the environment in a non reductive, in a non reductionist way that tries to retain some naturalistic credentials.
2102804	2114700	203	B	0.99791	So how the conventions are affecting and affecting the embodied agent in terms of forming those symbols and cashing out those epistemic values.
2117460	2139990	204	B	0.8	And well social interaction in this sense is not reduced to prediction because in this sense, the prediction will not be a primitive, but it will be a result of a specific participatory construction of the social scene over specific.
2141320	2158012	205	B	0.99414	Organizational principles and actions that, through the synchronization of these generative models, or the synchronization of those agents that can be described in terms of those generative models, gain predictive value.
2158146	2165020	206	B	1	And when you model that then you have this type of understand the value of prediction in those senses.
2166400	2199790	207	B	0.99872	So that allows that allows us to say that social actors in this sense can behave as if they have a generative model that synchronizes with that symbolic state of affairs allowing them to understand each other's behaviors or to develop approximate informational sensitive or responsiveness to the same symbols and goals.
2200210	2208530	208	B	0.99998	They are approximate because they're obviously not going to be the same but they have the same approximate orientation.
2208950	2213982	209	B	0.99992	So in this sense, we don't have ever a view from nowhere.
2214126	2221074	210	B	0.99998	We don't have ever this view that is only cashed out in terms of specific types of minds.
2221122	2229670	211	B	0.99999	But you also have types of minds shaped in terms of these very concrete organizations.
2234920	2240804	212	B	0.99998	That happens in a community, like for humans at least, it happens in community of language users.
2240932	2249692	213	B	0.99996	So their relationship with symbolic cues helps to select attention at that specific time as well.
2249746	2254776	214	B	0.86741	Pruning what should be ignored in socially constructed environments.
2254968	2273510	215	B	0.99922	So within a specific community of language users some types of actions will be desirable and will be deemed as true in that specific type of community and can be only evaluated under those terms.
2273960	2293320	216	B	0.99989	So you can provide reasons for actions in that specific context and you can talk about how rational that action is in terms of the conditions set by those communities.
2298230	2309400	217	B	1	And that brings us to the idea that human cognition in this sense is never decoupled from these cultural norms that pushes and orients them over time.
2309930	2312922	218	B	0.99954	So in those scale of behavior and that's the interesting thing.
2312976	2334480	219	B	1	And that's why active inference can be an interesting tool to model this type of human communities and this type of behavior because it can come from the very dynamics, the very basic of dynamics to specific types of perception and scale up and more.
2337860	2366510	220	B	0.53845	So when you have the problem of symbols, like in these two decoupled possible community of users and symbols and embodied agents and things that do not combine, we can try to model our agents in a way that we don't have this problem anymore because you're trying to include that very component into the model.
2368880	2380530	221	B	0.99998	So in this sense, we have active inference used as tools to explain social understanding, as generalized synchronization and in understanding others.
2381140	2397536	222	B	1	In that sense, because of this generalized synchronization model and assumed by those types of organizational principles, we can also engage in terms of niche construction.
2397648	2413980	223	B	0.99993	So we have a more or less deterministic way of understanding the nature of symbols because the more we interact and approximate synchronize with the environment, we change the environment that might change us back.
2414050	2424830	224	B	0.99992	So you have an open system that is always and everywhere situated and key can be modeled then with this type of predictive value.
2425520	2449510	225	B	0.99222	So that's more or less what I had in mind and that's how I was trying to think about biosemiotics and in a possible relationship with free energy principle and the formalisms of yeah, I think this is it.
2458310	2458818	226	A	0.97593	Awesome.
2458904	2460210	227	A	0.99979	Thank you, Lorena.
2461030	2465922	228	A	0.97078	I'll just organize things a little in my room.
2465976	2469570	229	A	0.99965	But thank you very much for this excellent lecture.
2470330	2476440	230	A	0.99908	Just as a kind of warm up, how did you come to see it this way?
2477290	2497150	231	A	0.99999	What brought you to this general question of semantics and how do you see that like on your own path and see what other comparable or analogous approaches have been done in terms of a meta analysis and proposal related to the naturalization of semantics?
2501090	2503934	232	B	1	I think it's kind of hard to naturalize semantics, right?
2503972	2506430	233	B	1	I think there's a lot of effort in doing that.
2506500	2515970	234	B	1	And it might be that if you think differently about how we naturalize those values, we might have better answers.
2518390	2524230	235	B	0.99958	Instead of trying to fit the agent into the model, we try to fit the model into the agent.
2524300	2524920	236	B	0.99979	Right?
2526490	2527794	237	B	1	I think that was the motivation.
2527842	2532438	238	B	1	I think there's the interesting part of biosymptics in that sense.
2532524	2534810	239	B	0.99865	It tries to make less assumptions.
2535310	2541594	240	B	0.93122	When we start from a hardcore assumption or model assumption, right.
2541632	2550080	241	B	0.99995	That semantics is only within the mind, then we have a very hard time trying to explain that.
2550530	2560082	242	B	0.99994	If you assume less about that, you might bring different types of explanations, of course, but they'd be more interesting.
2560216	2574280	243	B	1	I was trying to see how that looks like when you bring these two things together in the terms of active inference and free energy principle, if that works, if that is possible.
2574970	2577160	244	B	1	I don't know if that answers your question.
2581570	2593940	245	A	0.99981	So wondering about that fundamental question and then coming across active inference or how elsewhere have people brought in the more formal and technical into this question?
2598150	2600722	246	B	0.99956	What do you mean by more formal?
2600786	2604710	247	B	0.6	And can you repeat that, please?
2604780	2605110	248	A	0.99988	Yeah.
2605180	2612550	249	A	0.57993	How does active inference help us or have continuity or difference with previous ways that people have connected?
2612710	2624122	250	A	1	The technical part from what you described as the formal semantics embeds the mathematical formalism, and then the symbols are grounded in specific action.
2624266	2628830	251	A	0.99788	So has that been played out in other technical frameworks?
2629250	2633582	252	B	0.99871	Well, we do have technical frameworks that try to organize that in terms of an activism right.
2633636	2635674	253	B	0.41	And autopoietic and activism.
2635802	2644238	254	B	0.99999	But then we just have in these terms, the notion of symbols sometimes get loosely described.
2644254	2646530	255	B	0.95	And I think these guys are not really interested in that.
2646600	2669110	256	B	1	I think they're trying to describe something else, for example, or you can have some specific types of computational if you really buy into the mind computational brain and computational mind metaphor, then you have a hard time also to explain how semantics are built into that computation.
2669190	2669820	257	B	0.95563	Right.
2670190	2673482	258	B	1	I don't think anyone has a very strong answer to that.
2673536	2676970	259	B	0.99998	You have to really buy into the idea of information processing.
2677130	2680846	260	B	0.99	And that's what brought me a little bit to that.
2681028	2687726	261	B	1	If you buy into the metaphor of information processing, then you need to have semantics within the brain.
2687838	2695860	262	B	1	If you try to lose a little bit this notion, if you try to understand process and information in different terms, what happens?
2696390	2699638	263	B	1	I think that was more or less the question that I was trying to ask.
2699804	2724750	264	B	0.99	And if active inference and biosemiotics can, because they have less assumptions in terms of what happens inside the processing information content in the mind, if that can bring interesting answers or if you can use as a model to organize behavior.
2727810	2743540	265	B	0.55	And there's another point that also brought me to this type of thinking, was trying to understand how active inference can include the historicity of the agent.
2743990	2744402	266	B	0.98076	Right.
2744456	2752950	267	B	1	Because I think that something comes across debated in active inference, how you bring novelty into the state space.
2753020	2760966	268	B	0.64241	Like, once you define that state space, the state space is more or less deterministic because everything will happen within that specific range.
2760998	2767850	269	B	0.96471	So how does novelty comes within this type of modeling?
2768430	2771930	270	B	0.99969	So how can you explain that if it does?
2772000	2772860	271	B	1	I don't know.
2774450	2779998	272	B	0.6367	It's more like an exploratory question that I was trying to make and see how that pans out.
2780164	2782478	273	B	1	I actually also don't have an answer for that.
2782644	2797170	274	B	0.99058	But if you take seriously some more inactive claims that you need history of interactions to understand how agents behave, you cannot understand agents without that.
2797320	2802790	275	B	0.9979	So how does active inference answer this question specifically?
2804250	2809618	276	B	0.88646	Right, because once yeah, I think that's still kind of debated.
2809794	2821686	277	B	0.52783	I'm not sure if there's new developments in this specific topic, but I remember I think two years ago was like this specific papers from Di Paulo.
2821718	2828554	278	B	0.99	I think the Lane dawa Forking path is specifically focusing on that in the formalisms and et cetera.
2828682	2836420	279	B	0.99988	So I don't know if these two things can bring a little bit of more to the conversation, maybe not.
2838950	2839362	280	A	0.99459	Great.
2839416	2842066	281	A	0.99921	I'll just ask some more general questions.
2842168	2844494	282	A	0.99999	You're adding a lot with these thoughts.
2844622	2850230	283	A	0.99995	So you said that social interaction in this account is not reduced to prediction.
2850890	2856440	284	A	0.99995	So how would you unpack that and how would you relate this?
2858810	2868890	285	A	1	I don't know exactly what term of art would go here, but this kind of social epistemology that active inference provides us in contrast to say, predictive processing.
2869550	2873730	286	A	0.99962	So how is it that we would or wouldn't reduce something to prediction?
2873830	2878430	287	A	1	And then what is it that active inference brings into that discussion?
2879490	2882046	288	B	0.50481	Yeah, well, I think I have two points in that.
2882068	2890500	289	B	0.93655	Like, active inference in that sense has a type of modeling that tries to include all the time and everywhere the embodied agent.
2890870	2914698	290	B	0.99998	If you take seriously the idea, the generative model is always accurately modeling that specific agent because it cannot be true or false, your current state is like that even if you are not feeling really well, you just know that you're not feeling well in relation to something else.
2914784	2922220	291	B	0.94	And that story is still very accurate to your state condition right now.
2922770	2923614	292	B	0.99922	Right.
2923812	2935694	293	B	0.99992	So the prediction gains traction socially at least in that sense, not in this specific detail of predictive processing, I think, because I think that's more complicated.
2935742	2962330	294	B	0.97111	But socially, in social cognition, at least we can talk about this predictive value, I think is a more interesting way to do that because the example that I use in terms of catching out symbols, we are using something that was meant to make something intelligible that have very bad consequences that were not even close to be predicted.
2962750	2970220	295	B	0.99989	So in that sense and how these consequences happen, prediction cannot be there everywhere and all the time.
2970990	2974240	296	B	0.99	The prediction has an orientation as well, right?
2974770	2980430	297	B	0.99982	So that's going to unfold only in terms of the orientation, but that's not all encompassing.
2983570	2985318	298	B	0.99982	What does that say about the prediction?
2985354	2991570	299	B	0.9998	That's why I was trying to think of it as not being a primitive, but something that comes along with these dynamics.
2997450	3012550	300	A	0.98153	Well, this is a very deep impresscient point that because the causal structure of the world changes, historiosity agents change, they learn and they attend, and then the niche changes with stigma g and niche modification.
3012630	3037614	301	A	0.99919	So because things really do change through time, then just training a data set at one time point and then using that same generative model and carrying it forward, it's like picking a speed in a direction when you're on a winding road and just saying, all right, now let's turn on cruise control right now and just keep going in this direction.
3037662	3039140	302	A	0.99989	It's working right now.
3040630	3052070	303	A	0.99501	So then to connect that to the legibility of the forests as the causal model changed and externalities were not taken into account and so on, all these different features you brought in.
3052220	3092820	304	A	0.9999	So now is active inference and cognitive modeling, cognitive technologies increasing our legibility of perception, cognition and action through surveillance technology and other mechanisms such that there could be we expect there to be also hidden dynamics and externalities that we are also failing to see when we make some aspects of cognitive systems legible in the way that research in the neurosciences is happening towards.
3094870	3109606	305	B	0.99998	Yeah, I think in the sense if you're trying to do that, you cannot have a no like in a model that encompasses everything, right, that would be non informative in terms of when you do that, you're interested in something, right?
3109708	3121494	306	B	0.95015	You have one thing in mind when you're trying to flesh out in terms of cognitive modeling, how that applies to these more all encompassing situations.
3121542	3125294	307	B	1	I think that's like that model is how I'm trying to ask this question.
3125412	3136260	308	B	0.9999	So you can model them in this sliced sense and that's what we do as scientists and that's how we learn about things.
3136630	3144610	309	B	0.99752	But that only way of seeing that very specific model is not all encompassing for all answers.
3145990	3150686	310	B	0.99998	How can you use that in comparison to other situations?
3150718	3153094	311	B	0.9989	So how can you integrate this type of thing?
3153132	3153960	312	B	1	I don't know.
3155130	3157382	313	B	0.97	I don't have a question and an answer for that.
3157436	3164426	314	B	1	I don't know if we do have an answer for this type of question currently.
3164528	3183626	315	B	0.98891	But I think it's a very valid question to ask because also in the terms of sometimes applying that socially, that sort of raifies in a way and then it becomes an organizing principle that becomes somewhat raified.
3183738	3200040	316	B	0.99989	So keep an eye for these kinds of metaphorical use, like assuming a little bit that all this talk can be metaphorical and it can be interesting and useful to catch them out in these terms because they don't have other ways to talk about them.
3201450	3217798	317	B	0.52141	So how we don't Raify them and how they are, because I'm having a hard time to get there, but I think I'm making the point of people criticizing the causal primacy.
3217894	3233546	318	B	0.99703	So when you reduce these complex systems to one single cause, cashing out everything that organizes these complex systems in one primal cause, then you are losing the complexity.
3233738	3240306	319	B	1	However, if you don't do that, how can you slice it out to understand the system?
3240488	3250340	320	B	0.99985	So I think that's the two tensions here that I'm kind of trying to propose as a question instead of an answer.
3251590	3255414	321	B	1	I don't know if that makes sense, but are you thinking, yeah, I hope.
3255452	3257058	322	A	0.99998	People continue that discussion.
3257234	3262298	323	A	0.88906	I'm going to build on that just to kind of maybe circle around that because it's really important.
3262384	3282474	324	A	0.99957	So in the forestry case, the realist perspective, again using retro casting the way we or contemporary discussions, some of them in the active inference and free energy principle space are the realist says that region of land is just economic potential.
3282602	3286270	325	A	0.99993	It is a natural resource that becomes a kind of handle.
3286770	3294254	326	A	0.69	The instrumentalist perspective takes a step back and says it's as if that piece of land is a natural resource.
3294302	3298466	327	A	0.99997	So, yeah, the territory is indescribable and there's still a space for mystery.
3298578	3334410	328	A	0.99996	But then when the proxies come out because policies are being selected, the as if in some ways carries similar consequences to the actual and they may totally agree and the realists and the instrumentalists might be like, yeah, it is economic potential or represents or it could be treated as such or it could be engaged with as such that cognitive diversity can align on the social policy that then connects to these broader social questions and histories.
3334570	3338514	329	A	0.57	And so it's kind of interesting, like, what work does this instrumentalism do?
3338552	3340290	330	A	0.97704	Like, oh, it's just a principle.
3341670	3344482	331	A	1	What work does it do and what doesn't it do?
3344616	3355270	332	A	1	And the ways that science and technical engineering fields are and aren't deployed alone or together with other considerations.
3356250	3366362	333	B	0.99986	Yeah, that's very interesting in the sense I don't know if you're realist or instrumentalist about that, if you think models are not either true or false, they're just models, right.
3366416	3371846	334	B	0.9937	They might have used and they might be capturing real properties.
3371958	3389810	335	B	0.99915	But the problem is, in this conversation, even when you push them, like have realists and have an instrumentalist try to loosen up a little bit these assumptions, they still end up refine those principles and taking them to be more or less true or false.
3390150	3390850	336	B	0.99813	Right?
3391000	3392622	337	A	0.99991	Well, that's kind of a plot twist.
3392686	3403014	338	A	0.99308	It's like you're appealing to what surprise, minimization as unifying the diversity responses that the realist and instrumentalists do.
3403052	3413260	339	A	0.99996	So then does that make surprise or cognitive inertia, like the er principle where the maze just ends and it explains itself?
3413870	3418650	340	A	0.99999	Or how does that play in a pluralistic scientific setting?
3420110	3425920	341	B	0.99985	Yeah, you can have a third answer to that.
3429330	3438830	342	B	0.58	I think the answer that I'm trying to give is more eliminativist in the sense that eliminates the cause of primacy of them, of these two modes of answering.
3441670	3446178	343	B	0.96864	I'm thinking I have in mind now, actually, just to try to make sense of that.
3446344	3453746	344	B	0.99994	When you think about biological information, you can think about biological information as being real, as being metaphorical and instrumental.
3453938	3462854	345	B	0.99716	Or you have these guys like Susan Oyama or Richard lewantin, they try to bring some they are against this cause of primacy.
3462902	3470266	346	B	0.99997	They try to advocate for systems that do have that, but they have a lot of more going on.
3470368	3479210	347	B	0.99963	So that cannot be the only answer because those systems are not everywhere scientifically.
3480450	3482590	348	B	0.99998	They don't have to be everywhere.
3483170	3488222	349	B	0.94308	That, for example, going back to the forestry.
3488286	3504070	350	B	0.99996	So the realist is going to say that territory is valued property in the sense the instrumental is going to say, look as if it can be used as if but it's not necessarily value property.
3504220	3505158	351	B	0.93925	It doesn't matter.
3505244	3514650	352	B	1	You can say like, well, this terrain is seen from one perspective as value property, but it also has other uses around them.
3514720	3532474	353	B	0.99997	So you had to be more inclusive of this diversity because the only organizational principle around that specific terrain is not only to generate value or if it does, this value doesn't have one single output.
3532602	3538082	354	B	0.91245	It can have more than one output in terms of very specific terms.
3538136	3539534	355	B	0.83638	You can cash it out very materially.
3539582	3551766	356	B	0.99793	This terrain that has to provide monoculture, has to provide also value for the diversity of the fauna and the diversity of the flora around it.
3551868	3555798	357	B	0.52	And that is not included in a model because that's not what the model is done for.
3555884	3559320	358	B	1	The model has a specific use and that's fine.
3559690	3563020	359	B	1	However, that does not reduce the terrain to that.
3564910	3597038	360	B	0.81107	Well when you're talking about cognition, that might be more complicated, but I think it's an easy way to talk about this cause of primacy when you talk about forestry because we are very much now experiencing this climate crisis and we see these things happening right now and how difficult because this type of thinking is built over time and so well fixed in the way we see things and we are understanding how hard is to change that.
3597204	3597894	361	B	0.60802	It not.
3597932	3602680	362	B	0.51265	It's a paradigm shift that needs to happen for that to change.
3603130	3610120	363	B	0.8193	It's not necessarily the model that is right or wrong, it's just how you understand and apply them.
3612010	3614634	364	B	0.99241	So there are pragmatics into that.
3614672	3620422	365	B	0.99746	It's not only an instrumental, but it has something that the instrumentalist take does not capture.
3620486	3626502	366	B	1	And I don't know how to catch it out in one single word, but that's what Biosimatics was offering.
3626566	3631226	367	B	0.14542	Biosymiatics was offering the idea of practice and pragmatics.
3631338	3636900	368	B	1	I don't know if it's the whole story, but it's another point into that story.
3638950	3647278	369	A	0.83	A lot of great points all connect that note of pragmatism to a little bit of the active inference formalism.
3647454	3657830	370	A	0.99992	So when it comes to policy selection, behavior selection, some, but not all cognitive entities can act as if they're calculating expected free energy.
3657980	3669894	371	A	0.99997	So these are the active, the truly active entities, whether they're simple or whether they're sophisticated and they do planning expected free energy is how those agents are being modeled, as if they're making decisions.
3670022	3673502	372	A	1	And it consists of the pragmatic and the epistemic value.
3673556	3675706	373	A	0.54822	That's how these different policies are evaluated.
3675818	3689938	374	A	0.88	And so I see two angles or windows that that supports, at least from my non social sciences background, a new kind of meeting in the middle there.
3690104	3700998	375	A	0.99978	So first is the expansion of pragmatic value under the principle that surprise, minimization or bounding is the imperative right there in the pragmatic value.
3701084	3706370	376	A	0.99999	It doesn't have to be just body temperature or financial income.
3706530	3712234	377	A	1	We can expect and prefer ourself to be learning new things or meeting new people.
3712352	3724298	378	A	1	And so we can load into the pragmatism different goals that under a narrower definition of utility or pragma have not traditionally been included.
3724314	3732414	379	A	0.99946	So I think that first way is it speaks to a more inclusive concept of utility, you might say.
3732452	3739550	380	A	0.99998	I'm also derisking on forest fires alongside the timber and already you have now plural pragma.
3739630	3747310	381	A	0.99709	So I think that's the kind of crossover and then the deeper and second and not saying there's only two ways that the conversation continues.
3747390	3771210	382	A	0.99999	We have epistemic utility in terms of epistemic value and so the balance and the weighting between pragmatic value and epistemic or learning oriented activity overall helps control a dynamics balance with just like how tight is the grip and the preference overall.
3771870	3779934	383	A	1	And maybe we have some preference for timber to be exported from a region but we really don't know.
3779972	3783322	384	A	0.99998	We don't have long term modeling, we don't have deep causal analysis.
3783466	3806386	385	A	1	And so we're going to put 5% on the pragmatic extraction and other pragmatic features and leave the rest of the policy in an exploratory mode and come to a blend that's not just on the spectrum from explore to exploit, which is how this has been approached in cognitive sciences previously.
3806578	3817354	386	A	0.99962	It's like this is the third thing where policies that are on the frontier of exploring and exploiting rise to the top through their contributions to pragmatic and epistemic value.
3817472	3818986	387	A	1	And we made the model.
3819168	3825710	388	A	0.99999	So that isn't to say that that is what's happening on the ground or maybe that's just the instrumentalist perspective.
3829650	3835870	389	B	0.51792	Yeah, but if it's an instrumentalist perspective, it might be a good one, right?
3835940	3841074	390	B	0.98954	In the sense the idea of inclusion is kind of the interesting one.
3841112	3841362	391	B	0.97684	Right?
3841416	3853090	392	B	1	Because if you refine the notion of maximization because you can use that in certain ways to understand what happens within when you're modeling something, what is the limit of that maximization?
3853170	3859058	393	B	0.98654	So you can model agents as if maximizing utility, for instance.
3859234	3867034	394	B	0.56744	But maximizing utility is something that needs to be balanced out with utility of everyone around them.
3867072	3867660	395	B	0.9229	Right?
3868350	3871578	396	B	0.78	And that's not trivial how that happens.
3871664	3871962	397	B	0.92657	Right?
3872016	3885120	398	B	1	And even if it does, and even if it were trivial, it's not something that maps out completely identically with every single agent.
3886770	3888402	399	B	0.96253	There's going to be diversity there.
3888536	3895362	400	B	0.99984	So how do you make that notion more inclusive and less raified in that sense?
3895496	3904498	401	B	0.99779	Because then if the more you Raify, the more you single it out into around only one general type of understanding.
3904674	3918838	402	B	0.9999	So when you think them more individually, then you lose that strength of this one single principle organized, one single way of cashing out utility.
3918934	3920038	403	B	0.54025	That's not the principle.
3920134	3920780	404	B	0.97068	Sorry.
3922110	3936218	405	B	0.99981	So I think that speaks a lot with the type of instrumental use and the type of pragmatism, the types of application of these practices.
3936314	3936730	406	B	0.99846	Right.
3936820	3942110	407	B	0.99998	Remember, in the sense of the scientific forestry, it's also a practice.
3942190	3950486	408	B	0.99993	It's not something that is true in itself, it's true in terms of practice, right, in terms of applications, in terms of building communities around them.
3950588	3954630	409	B	0.99996	So without this use they have no grounding.
3957210	3965770	410	A	0.99996	Yeah, one really strong and salient point that I got from the lecture was about generalized synchrony.
3966350	3978506	411	A	1	And it's almost funny that we have to advocate or delineate generalized synchrony because the alternative, the absence of generalized synchrony is just like kind of like an ideal gas.
3978698	4000200	412	A	0.98182	It's like there wouldn't be regularities in society, we wouldn't be clustered in space or in time, we wouldn't have information and communication and we wouldn't have what differentiates a society or a group or a civilization or a colony or whatever from literally anything else.
4000650	4013782	413	A	0.99995	So generalized synchrony is almost like all of the space between nothing and anything happening and then it supports all these different scenarios.
4013846	4020806	414	A	0.99998	We could have this kind of mind in this kind of brain in this kind of environment and this kind of niche.
4020918	4034830	415	A	0.57	And so we can talk about the ant colony foraging algorithms that work in the desert and there might be mutual, nonexhausted, open ended change of algorithms and what works in a different setting.
4035350	4072054	416	A	1	And with humans we have the sophistication and the history and the scope and the scale and all of these metas and weaving with is and ought and our own forward going direction, which is really the moment where it goes from being a forensic sociology to the real time sense making and action selection based upon our cognitive models.
4072182	4075390	417	A	1	In the broader sense, which includes humans and non human agents.
4075460	4090820	418	A	0.99999	But it's like that's when it goes from being more than just an understanding, when that understanding translates to an action policy and they do, then it matters as much as anything does.
4093110	4093860	419	B	0.99657	Yeah.
4094230	4105270	420	B	1	One of the criticism of the active inference, I think common is like it is too general to single out specific constraints that orient action.
4105850	4138442	421	B	0.98137	That's what I thought thinking about how symbols are brought about in community of language users, assuming that the symbols are not they are only meaningful throughout these histories and practices can help us to apply this type of general yeah, navigating specific, well, epistemic communities.
4138506	4145522	422	B	1	And I think that's the work that Maho is going to bring along in terms of epistemic communities and then you single out in them.
4145576	4155430	423	B	0.99538	So you have these communities of language users in which specific practices create specific orientations.
4157210	4157862	424	A	0.99728	Yeah.
4157996	4172198	425	A	1	One thought on that asking like what does active inference or linear regression or some other method again, this is who knows, is this just deep esoteric instrumentalism?
4172374	4175410	426	A	0.99998	But asking what does it have to say about this symbol?
4175510	4179230	427	A	1	What does active inference have to say about the letter E in English?
4180930	4196638	428	A	0.99999	Can it be as simple as to say that that's a category error and that you could make a toy example or a pedagogical example where symbol one and symbol two oscillate in a multi agent simulation or you could make a generative model for an alphabet and leave it abstract.
4196734	4212810	429	A	0.74223	But you're never going to connect to the historiosity and the real enactment of the English letter E unless you're confronting the minute particulars and the actual embodiment of that letter.
4213470	4222650	430	A	1	And then there's different course grainings, different iterated modeling decisions, different questions about how do you include and participate in the different stages of the scientific process.
4222720	4230654	431	A	0.99977	But it's like you're in the specifics at that point, active inference doesn't have an opinion on the letter E because we wouldn't want it to.
4230772	4232974	432	A	0.99984	It would be too opinionated about the wrong things.
4233012	4250194	433	A	0.92918	It'd be making assumptions and bringing axioms into play that would be extremely constraining and so it remains general as a framework and the free energy principle even more differently.
4250242	4255318	434	A	0.94069	So but when we get into the actual, that's where we're connecting to the real systems of interest.
4255484	4267660	435	A	0.87197	But how could we make claims and advance them socially about systems of interest when we're not even it's like comparing bridge building as a concept with this bridge right here.
4268430	4272730	436	A	0.99987	It's a little bit like a category disconnect.
4275650	4280720	437	B	0.63546	Yeah, well, it depends also how you single out some things.
4281490	4284190	438	B	0.68858	You just don't do that because they're just not interesting enough.
4284260	4284842	439	B	0.96949	Right.
4284996	4295170	440	B	0.96237	There's nothing that comes out of it in terms of this bridge right here in a single how did you put it again?
4295240	4307880	441	B	0.8716	Like a category of bridges and this bridge right here, right when you do that you can learn something about the category in terms of this single one right here.
4308650	4316282	442	B	0.87628	But it's not exhaustive that's I think one point it's not exhaustive and it's not right or wrong.
4316336	4326622	443	B	0.99508	It might be better than other I think they did you can make some comparisons in terms of predictive value.
4326676	4332350	444	B	0.9749	You can have better or worse ways of doing it and then it gains more utility.
4333570	4347950	445	A	0.73038	Okay, connecting this to also this non exhaustive nature and where the power of a generalizable framework is let's talk about the category of Golden Gate Bridges in San Francisco.
4348110	4352278	446	A	0.99175	So there's only one actual bridge there, but we're generalizing it.
4352284	4358966	447	A	0.93	And so somebody makes a state space and says well, I'm exploring if there was more than two end to end.
4359068	4370650	448	A	0.98632	So they're exploring the state space of topologies of bridge and someone else is exploring the state space of color and somebody else is exploring the state space of traffic dynamics and someone else is combining two of them or combining all three of them.
4370800	4382640	449	A	1	And then that's the conversation is which map of this category of state spaces, category of adjacent possibles as we chose to model it.
4383330	4389150	450	A	1	And if you don't include traffic flow, don't be surprised that it's not going to take that kind of data or make that kind of prediction.
4389310	4394030	451	A	1	And some variables matter and some matter in combination and some don't.
4394190	4407560	452	A	0.99996	But when we model, we kind of build these regions or adjacencies to the actual which is where the historiosity of the past leaves us.
4408410	4422650	453	A	1	And then we have an adjacent possible as modelers and sense makers including absurd counterfactuals and state spaces and then the state spaces are mobilized.
4426340	4427184	454	B	0.96224	Yeah, in a way.
4427222	4435996	455	B	0.99963	But if you talk about specific type of engineering yes, in that sense they are mobilized and they are not true or false.
4436028	4439570	456	B	0.55713	You can use false models that still function.
4442260	4446420	457	B	0.84425	You can have specific uses of things that you know they're not really true.
4446490	4460996	458	B	0.99718	Like the thing, the taleric type of modeling, the solar system, they still use that to navigate in the desert even though it's not really accurate.
4461028	4467324	459	B	0.99986	But if you want to go from A to B, it helps you to do that, that's a different thing.
4467362	4467950	460	B	0.52543	Right.
4468400	4492710	461	B	0.76129	It's not true or false, but when you think about agents in terms of and if bringing back to the idea of symbols being only cashed out in terms of community of users that have histories and they are made useful, they are made meaningful in terms of their practices, then you don't have ever this disconnect, right?
4493400	4499008	462	B	0.99997	You can think about this cognition is always connected to this specific types of practicing.
4499104	4507450	463	B	0.99999	You can even single out some moments of it and try to see what you learn from this kind of slice of time.
4508620	4525600	464	B	0.83606	But when you think about the whole story of the cognitive system, if you're going to really think of it in terms that is valuable, you cannot disconnect from the state, let's say the state space of its practice.
4528100	4528656	465	A	0.99998	Awesome.
4528758	4529410	466	B	0.99854	Well.
4532260	4540916	467	A	0.99998	Do you have any closing thoughts or what are you looking forward to with the discussion section and the rest of the course?
4541018	4543844	468	A	0.91251	Just by way of wrapping up and letting people know?
4543882	4545860	469	A	0.99997	Any other thoughts?
4546440	4552376	470	B	0.99989	Yeah, would be cool to explore this idea that we've been actually bringing along here, right?
4552478	4570300	471	B	0.99999	How we can go with that instrumentally, realistically or how can we understand this general synchronization of the model in terms of specific instantiations and how informative they are?
4570370	4571804	472	B	0.99999	Is that really interesting?
4571922	4579084	473	B	0.99993	Or how can these things be actually raised in terms of modeling?
4579132	4584736	474	B	0.98	And if that happens, does that have any specific consequences actually or not?
4584838	4585810	475	B	0.99843	Maybe not.
4588470	4589218	476	A	0.95552	Awesome.
4589384	4593342	477	A	0.96983	Well, very ambitious and excellent lecture.
4593406	4596660	478	A	0.99778	So thank you very much Lorena, and talk to you.
4597670	4601062	479	B	0.9831	Just keep in mind I was just like trying to ask these questions.
4601116	4602870	480	B	1	I don't also have those answers.
4603690	4609922	481	B	1	I found very little about active inference and semiotics produced.
4609986	4612434	482	B	1	I found a few papers.
4612482	4614934	483	B	0.98983	So that's very exploratory actually.
4615132	4620520	484	B	0.56701	So you're invited to think of these things and explore a little bit them further if it's possible.
4621690	4622150	485	A	0.94603	Cool.
4622220	4622818	486	A	0.99865	Epic.
4622914	4623718	487	A	0.98616	All right.
4623884	4624578	488	A	0.99944	Thank you, Lauren.
4624594	4625790	489	A	0.87	I see you in a couple of weeks.
4625900	4626750	490	A	0.9201	Farewell.
4627170	4627546	491	B	0.26736	Ciao.
4627578	4627690	492	B	0.58209	Bye.
