6830	7250	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
7320	8820	A	0.915437638759613	Hello and welcome everyone.
9190	14178	A	0.8401340842247009	This is the course active inference for the social sciences in 2023.
14344	18418	A	0.9163888692855835	It's August 30, or maybe a different date, depending on where you are.
18584	22590	A	0.8902775049209595	And today we're in the semiotics and semantics section.
22750	29318	A	0.8716802597045898	We'll be hearing a lecture from Lorena Zegenzerla, and then we're going to have a little bit of a discussion.
29414	34810	A	0.9664604663848877	So, Lorena, thank you a lot for joining and off to you for the lecture.
36350	38460	B	0.5436457991600037	Okay, hello, everyone.
39970	42170	B	0.8801348209381104	I'm based in Australia.
42250	43322	B	0.8006958961486816	Yeah, I'm Lorena.
43386	46800	B	0.6891847848892212	I'm doing actually my PhD in philosophy here.
47330	49834	B	0.8127990365028381	We work in cognitive sciences and philosophy.
49882	53300	B	0.8439849615097046	I work with concepts and notions of information.
54150	64614	B	0.716924250125885	So I'm very interested in foundational understanding of cognitive sciences and information and how these kind of things cash out.
64812	75686	B	0.5625714659690857	And this is why I was interested in talking about semantics and social cognition to see how these things cash out.
75708	91662	B	0.7836968302726746	I have a few ideas on how semiotics can be compatible with, like, active inference, and I try to organize a little bit of this semiotic notion and active inference to see if they pan out.
91796	92730	B	0.6072053909301758	Maybe they don't.
92810	94560	B	0.6892863512039185	So let's see how it goes.
96610	101230	B	0.8677440881729126	So let's talk about active inference, formal semantics, and social cognition.
104930	105920	B	0.7575401067733765	What's up?
107090	109826	B	0.8793906569480896	Okay, I cannot move my Lloyds now.
109848	110580	B	0.664699375629425	I can.
111350	118370	B	0.7881205081939697	So I will first have a very short introduction for you guys I have out here.
118440	119278	B	0.8491557240486145	So what are you going to do?
119304	120658	B	0.8144814968109131	Like, we have a short introduction.
120754	133498	B	0.8234999179840088	I'm going to talk a little bit of theories of meaning, and then we're going to talk a little bit the free energy principle and active inference and how shared symbols and social cognition can be thought together.
133664	138410	B	0.5755100250244141	I bring one case that I find interesting and then we draw some conclusions.
138850	146190	B	0.8698298931121826	So let me know what you think in the comments and after we can have a little discussion or in the next session.
148050	159922	B	0.887709379196167	So the background introduction that I want to first point to is we are talking about biological agents and how they act.
160056	177450	B	0.8599192500114441	So we are always thinking in terms of biological agents acting to express in ways that express informational sensitivities to context dependent relevance to their environment and things that involve communities.
177790	195242	B	0.8177951574325562	However, how this very minimal way of talking about what motivates and what is relevant to people becomes stable enough as a self sustaining pattern of interactions, like, are they stable and how they become that stable?
195306	210350	B	0.8862631320953369	So how can those information sensitivities ground values, norms, and goals consistently and over time, assuming that those values and goals are necessary for meaningful interactions?
210510	214066	B	0.8597241640090942	So we have to align motivations to behavior, right?
214088	215390	B	0.5824390649795532	That's not really obvious.
215560	220294	B	0.8226607441902161	And ultimately how meaning is brought about.
220492	228700	B	0.8069500923156738	I don't think I'm going to answer that, but I want to point to some directions and how people have been thinking about these questions over time.
231150	234554	B	0.6174058318138123	So the problem of meaning has a brief account, right?
234592	250400	B	0.8821046352386475	Like, traditionally approaches of to cognition, localize meaning inside individual organisms and more specifically, inside their minds so meaning pertains to content in this kind of thing.
252150	260654	B	0.6464533805847168	However, like many have a developmental history so it's hard to catch those two things together if it's inside people's minds.
260782	276870	B	0.7458681464195251	How we can have an evolutionary and developmental history assuming that meanings are things that we can learn over time and they happen in shared context, they don't happen out of nowhere in a vision, from nowhere.
278590	298158	B	0.7012796401977539	In a sense we can say that it's not really trivial that conventionalized words like for example, the conventionalized meaning of a word, for instance, catch means catch, have evolutionary histories one thing does not come from the other.
298324	305106	B	0.8290694952011108	We need a broader understanding to cash this meaning out and that's where I'm stepping from.
305208	306878	B	0.5682275891304016	That's my grounding.
306974	316454	B	0.7275973558425903	We need to cast these things out in terms of community of language users which brings a problem, right?
316492	322546	B	0.8619757294654846	We have goals and values that can be defined in terms of those communities and you have material embodied factors.
322658	334060	B	0.8893893957138062	So how these two things are together or how goals and values affect and motivate material and embodied agents?
336270	341760	B	0.8409898281097412	To answer this kind of question, like over time, there are a few preferred ways.
342370	351210	B	0.9091427326202393	I will do a brief overview of some theories of meaning usually in terms of cognitive sciences and any philosophy of mind.
351380	355122	B	0.7543701529502869	That's what I'm interested in how they cast it out.
355176	376230	B	0.8794435858726501	They usually try to think of those things in terms of syntax like concerns with form as an abstract organizing kind of rule is a type of grammar and how the order of things and how the logical unfolding of those symbols, how they become meaningful.
377550	382134	B	0.5692420601844788	But the syntax itself is not really enough to cash out meaning in semantics.
382262	391626	B	0.884657084941864	So then in that sense syntax evolve into a field that we call semantics, in which meaning and mental content are organized.
391738	410420	B	0.6694409251213074	Throughout this instructional syntax then we have propositional knowledge and truth conditions in which allows these organizational story of meaningful words to make sense and they're going to point out into the outside world.
410790	418194	B	0.7357287406921387	And we have a third option it's not so new, but it's not so famous, which is semantics.
418242	421270	B	0.7785671353340149	Or more importantly, I will focus on biosemantics.
423290	439870	B	0.8457478880882263	It concerns with the use of symbols like how they bring about meaning in terms of pragmatics and that will be a little bit different and we'll catch it out in different terms in relation to its peers like semantics and syntax.
440370	443534	B	0.6957413554191589	Well, syntax is pretty clear in terms of being rules, right?
443572	446238	B	0.7761527895927429	So what is semantics talk about?
446324	459070	B	0.9067996144294739	So talk about mental content, about intentionality, about mental representations in the sense we have semantics that have specific key concepts that reference truth conditions and denotation.
459230	465734	B	0.7388843297958374	So if you have mental content and if you put these meanings inside the organism, it has to refer to something else.
465772	469206	B	0.5019050240516663	And how this cognitive penetration happens.
469308	475078	B	0.7027086615562439	Like, how can meaning come about inside the mind?
475164	486682	B	0.8856357336044312	And how that refers to something outside in the world and how this observational viewpoint of you thinking about something in front of you can be actually true.
486736	513358	B	0.8516261577606201	So we need truth conditions that denote this specific relationship and that is represented in terms of mental content contemporarily there's like various ways of catching this out that can be functional, that can be more internalized mental specific types of representations grounded in vehicles.
513374	516422	B	0.49699950218200684	It's a very rich discussion and I don't want to go into all that.
516476	533894	B	0.5213763117790222	I just want to point it out that science and neuroscience use those terms to study and to build models that relate to mental representations in terms of neuro representations because it kind of makes sense for us like brain activity.
533942	546222	B	0.8870259523391724	You can see them in terms of what happens by studying human beings and by studying animals and how these mental representations relate to something that happens in the world.
546276	559726	B	0.8169589638710022	You can see that one behavior elicits specific activities and they have a correlational relationship and that is highly debated.
559838	560786	B	0.5275619626045227	But there we go.
560808	577690	B	0.881548285484314	We have many types of cashing out neural representations and concerning to this relationship of stimuli and the interpretation of this stimuli and how they motivate action.
579550	590650	B	0.49806955456733704	That's already a very much weaker claim in relation to mental content and things being inside organisms but it is still in the same line of reasoning.
591870	608814	B	0.8419364094734192	And there is also biosemiotics which I want to focus a little bit more because it concerns the use and the interpretation of signs and symbols which also emphasizes the embodied nature and the situated nature of meaning.
608942	615640	B	0.5936444401741028	So you don't have meaning without those practices and without the use of embodied agents.
616490	626594	B	0.5752280354499817	So we have to reject the idea that meaning are abstract symbols or they going to be something that has to be in your mind and refer to something outside.
626732	642638	B	0.8748841285705566	They're going to only exist in this type of relationship and they can take many forms including chemical signals like visual clues, behavior, words like the word cat you can have how you organize the word cat.
642724	646750	B	0.7145088911056519	They are all symbolic and that fits also in that kind of structure.
647090	663842	B	0.6756072640419006	So they are very important for communication, obviously because we do communicate in terms of pointing to the same shared notions of symbols in words and also other types of symbolic meaning and we coordinate life around them.
663896	674690	B	0.8890320062637329	So living systems are then here characterized by the biosemite semiotics, by their ability of creating and interpreting and using these symbols in terms of their practices.
674850	690314	B	0.7771874666213989	The fathers of biosemiotics started probably in the 19th century and Ox Cole is one of the most famous representatives.
690442	698830	B	0.7689103484153748	Currently you can find new authors like Hoffman, Maya or Baker.
700530	719922	B	0.8886471390724182	So I tried to organize a little bit in a specific model, in a type of model, in a visual story, how these two types of understanding meaning are being applied in terms of theories of meaning historically.
720066	727366	B	0.8985055685043335	So in biosemiotics we have the pragmatics and you have the practice and they relate to dynamics and context dependent.
727478	745430	B	0.7590780258178711	So you can see here on the top of the screen how agent we have the agent relationship with its psychological and social aspects and biosemiotics is somewhat concerned how correlation leads to prediction and beliefs and that leads to expectations.
745590	763140	B	0.8827391862869263	And we also have other types of theories like telesymantics and and theories of computational syntax that tries to understand the dynamics and the mechanism of this relationship.
765210	769560	B	0.6908748149871826	And they are not really crossing each other.
772410	775158	B	0.6020044088363647	They're not talking about the same necessary things.
775244	777900	B	0.5854441523551941	So how can these things be brought together?
779470	791450	B	0.6234281063079834	That's when I was thinking how we can bring this free energy principle and active inference in terms of those relationships.
793310	802430	B	0.8901729583740234	The free energy principle and active inference, as we know and I have been talking about probably in the past two classes.
803010	807550	B	0.9047325849533081	It's a model that is interesting for that because it has like very minimal assumptions.
807710	815782	B	0.8700923919677734	So it starts off from the idea that organisms act to maintain themselves in their expected biological and cognitive states.
815916	826120	B	0.8228625655174255	So you're always talking, you're modeling and using these mathematicals to ground biological agents in a very embodied sense.
826910	830218	B	0.6114792227745056	And they do so by minimizing their free energy.
830304	830746	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
830848	838902	B	0.7304593324661255	So they have these metabolical states that have to be minimized in terms of expenditure, in terms of uncertainty.
838966	847102	B	0.8170403242111206	Given that the long term average of free energy is entropy, they want to minimize their uncertainty in terms of their metabolical states.
847156	854622	B	0.9020694494247437	What that entails that they have a specific range of states they want to stay in, like minimally to stay alive.
854686	863582	B	0.8538995981216431	To stay alive, you have to do a bunch of things as a human being, but every single embodied agent would you prefer to stay alive?
863646	887098	B	0.8340620994567871	So there are some preferred basic states that we've defined how action will be take first to maintain metabolical states and how that coordinate with the environment, which entails that organisms and agents can be described in those terms.
887184	907890	B	0.8172793388366699	Like an active inference tries to bring out those minimal assumptions in mathematical terms that try to express how reducing the probability of these non anticipated states or states that are not favorable to maintaining their minimal metabolical needs will be reduced.
908230	908642	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
908696	932490	B	0.8498991131782532	And that can be catched in terms of a generative model, as we've been saying throughout the past actions, how this generative model sets specific times and organizes around specific parameters that can be described as trying to maintain those parameters within reasonable range.
933470	941510	B	0.774052619934082	So by minimizing free energy on average and over time, this system will self organize.
941590	948462	B	0.9059950113296509	So we will bring out the parameters of its internal states that occupy a limited number of possible states.
948516	961406	B	0.9347543716430664	We will set into a specific range that will then be then will be used as somewhat the base and the guide for this behavior.
961518	967554	B	0.8258818984031677	You have two kinds of dynamics happening here, right?
967672	969814	B	0.7004075646400452	That's what I want to talk about a little bit.
969932	977634	B	0.8579555153846741	So we have then a phenotype that exists in a specific type of states, but that will have to coordinate two different kinds of dynamics.
977682	981338	B	0.9074445366859436	They're going to be stated here as complementary, right?
981424	984054	B	0.8691985011100769	You have flow states and have belief updating.
984182	1011490	B	0.8385768532752991	So with flow states you have one type of modeling which is the known equilibrium steady states that we use intrinsic is named here intrinsic information geometry and you have belief updating that can be treated as extrinsic informational geometry and those are different types of modeling or different types of thinking about those processes that's most important, right?
1011640	1020882	B	0.8978918194770813	So in terms of flow states we can talk about dynamical system and how you settle and self organize specific parameters.
1020946	1047150	B	0.9124122858047485	And in terms of belief updating we will be talking about Bayesian mathematics and Bayesian cognition and specific ways of cashing out how an agent will change and behave over time in relation to the dynamics that is set into place in this state space of possible actions.
1049570	1063854	B	0.9006475806236267	So while dynamical systems will explore temporal and contextual, dependence between environment and agent will set this specific state space that has temporal dimension and has contextual dimension.
1063982	1078502	B	0.8644053339958191	And once this state space is sort of established, we have more or less deterministic approach to what can possibly unfold.
1078566	1100186	B	0.8964877724647522	So how changes and how behavior can be cashed out in terms of nondeterministic behavior and that is defined by the different type of probabilistic thinking which is the Bayesian mechanics of belief, of belief updating.
1100298	1111540	B	0.9087669849395752	So we have then a process of belief updating throughout weighted interactions within this range of possible states.
1111910	1121030	B	0.8613564968109131	So we do have dynamics and we do also have biasian process unfolding together in terms of mechanisms.
1122570	1132490	B	0.6642270088195801	And with that we do have mathematical statements providing a unifying perspective on formal approaches connecting behavior and dynamics.
1132910	1149242	B	0.772262454032898	So that's what active inference should be bringing about as a novelty in relation to older forms of understanding organisms which can either cash things out in term of behavior or in terms of dynamics.
1149386	1157250	B	0.8172491192817688	So trying to bring these two things together is quite interesting to understand how symbols and what is semantics for instance?
1157750	1162434	B	0.8729342222213745	So that's the question I will be asking right now.
1162552	1164600	B	0.8614903688430786	Let's talk a little bit about that.
1165690	1183290	B	0.8643373250961304	I'm drawing here from quite interesting paper from Maxwell Ramstead and in politely is free energy principle a principle for formal semantics?
1183630	1186262	B	0.863334596157074	So what would be formal semantics?
1186326	1189774	B	0.6499208211898804	It sounds like an oxymoron, right?
1189812	1192894	B	0.6307668685913086	Like how semantics can be formal, how can you formalize it?
1192932	1195678	B	0.8073544502258301	So semantics, the theory of meaningful things.
1195844	1198960	B	0.6991351246833801	So how can that be empty of content?
1200050	1210370	B	0.8546309471130371	Well, it has a few principles in which you can explain what formal semantics should how a formal semantics should be understood.
1210950	1223206	B	0.8403270840644836	First off, we have Bayesian formalism that does not necessarily have to commit to classical notions of representations which are propositional in nature, have propositional semantic content.
1223308	1231894	B	0.635209321975708	So the idea is that you can use the notion of a representation in a way that is not necessarily contentful.
1231942	1233866	B	0.8241133689880371	So how that's going to be?
1234048	1238422	B	0.8529722094535828	So under the free energy principle, representations can be formal.
1238486	1270470	B	0.7767531871795654	That's the argument they are bringing under the physics of flow, specifically dynamical system theories and information geometry you can have these mathematical statements that only represent possible specific ways of interacting, how these correlations will affect each other over time in this variational base type of cashing out mathematical functionals.
1272090	1277942	B	0.8970827460289001	In this sense, we can talk about representational, how they can be understood under this formalism.
1278006	1289122	B	0.8421258330345154	And what they are saying is they are best understood as internal structures that enable the system to parse out their sensory sensitivities or the sensory streams.
1289286	1303750	B	0.6413040161132812	So to organize them in specific parameters and also in the terms of their own Markov blankets in their blanket states, which is interesting here.
1303820	1326570	B	0.6340412497520447	What is the new genealogy of this paper is that grounding a mathematical model in these mathematical properties of the system will avoid grounding these properties in terms of the properties of symbols and thematics in abstract or subjective notions of meaning, but impossible ranges of action.
1328130	1351886	B	0.7743588089942932	So summing up, what we had before was a type of computational model that had specific components that does not allow for the intelligibility intelligibility of a cognitive component which is intention, which is motivation, context, brain, computer metaphors.
1351998	1361766	B	0.8841931819915771	We have neuro and cognitive activity often seen as a transfer of symbolic information and cognition, then a snapshot of this transfer.
1361868	1374090	B	0.5458142161369324	So it's totally dependent of that kind of symbolical transfer which is really difficult to explain how that's going to be biologically plausible and there's a lot of effort trying to do that.
1374160	1382606	B	0.5708909034729004	So if you're interested in this, there's a very vast wealth of literature but they have to answer to this problem.
1382788	1400786	B	0.8699160218238831	So how the mind and brain needs to produce an impromptu response to inputs of the external environment all the time and the idea of this formal semantics the authors is trying to explain is trying to include this component into the model.
1400888	1408070	B	0.7671958804130554	So you have a deflationary model about content, so you have a formal semantics, you have semantics without content.
1408220	1415598	B	0.8590903878211975	Interestingly and formulated as a variation of free energy functional.
1415714	1451560	B	0.8981746435165405	So those structures that embody those process correspond to states in the system and we also have the biological component that can be formalized in terms of disturb informational geometry that these two densities do probabilistic densities, one from the dynamics and one from the Bay agent describing behavior and now what?
1451630	1455648	B	0.8186028599739075	So how can active inference be compatible to biosematics?
1455684	1459180	B	0.6725274324417114	Can it be actually compatible or is it even necessary?
1461840	1489508	B	0.5368843674659729	Well, active inference is a very general framework and then it does not really give us the tools to understand how encoding can happen in terms of symbols, like how they can be broadcasted into collective action because prediction alone does not explain how do they come about.
1489594	1509836	B	0.8958548307418823	So in this sense we do have meaningful correlations that refer to the dynamics of one or two or more systems in terms of informational geometry that needs to be cached out with predictive value.
1509938	1513870	B	0.6847668886184692	So how is this possible?
1516080	1519724	B	0.7760756611824036	Well, we can talk about that in terms of shared attention.
1519852	1524480	B	0.8318614363670349	That's one form of this kind of model to cash this out.
1524550	1531504	B	0.728001058101654	So we have active inference capturing relevant statistical relations between environment and aging.
1531632	1552200	B	0.8648713827133179	And why I'm trying to think about here is how biosyniotics offer tools for these informational sensitivities and statistical relations to cache symbols in terms of use and interpretation within communities of language users.
1556400	1560072	B	0.7451715469360352	And that can only happen in the sense via directed action.
1560136	1588660	B	0.6005910038948059	So the problem now will turn into how is it possible to specify the factors that are sufficient to constrain action and direct that into specific interaction fault is through the history interaction fault is European forestry.
1589000	1608052	B	0.6662137508392334	I'm picking this example from a very like from James, I really recommend kind of tells this story about how coordinated action, how states coordinate specific collective actions.
1608196	1610060	B	0.5890167355537415	But that's not the point that I want to talk here.
1610130	1619200	B	0.8748458623886108	So here, let's unfold that a little bit in terms of the design of scientific forestry and think about scientific forestry as a practice.
1619940	1672200	B	0.5369588732719421	And a practice that has an organizing principle that will like that will be the main important articulating story that can connect together how agriculture layouts plantations in specific ways and how collective farms will make specific choices in terms of this organization and how villages can structure themselves around one specific notion or one specific organizational principle and how everything can be calculated to make one type of practice, which is agriculture is a very general, more legible and more manipulable for different kinds of communities.
1672360	1682304	B	0.8324053287506104	So in that we will involve manipulating the very concrete aspects of the land, the terrain, the products, the workforce.
1682432	1691510	B	0.7926481366157532	So it has a very encompassing effect over time and in a very concrete sense.
1693340	1706004	B	0.7906517386436462	And interestingly when you talk about European forestry and how European forestry was modeling the terrain and how it's catching out value of these terrains.
1706132	1722432	B	0.4936251640319824	They were not trying to do that to successfully depict the full range of diversity of the actual social activity and the actual activity of agriculture or the richness of the vegetation or they are not even trying.
1722486	1724016	B	0.5334382057189941	They didn't intend to do that.
1724038	1730370	B	0.5641922950744629	That was not the point of this kind of modeling turned into a practice, right?
1730920	1741060	B	0.715360164642334	Those models generally represent specific slices of nature that were interesting for one specific official observer.
1741480	1758700	B	0.6255242228507996	And that point is really important because that will shape how all these communities and how the terrain and how the forest will unfold over time within this specific perspective.
1759680	1769570	B	0.9651293754577637	So I bring here a quote that I really really like because it tries to flesh this out in simple terms and very useful ones.
1770580	1791780	B	0.8059520125389099	So, thinking that exaggerating only slightly, one might say that the interest in forest was resolved through one fiscal specific single number, which was the revenue that yield from the timber that was extracted annually.
1792440	1797528	B	0.5542481541633606	Well, that's okay, that's understandable, that's intelligible and that happens to you every day.
1797614	1813340	B	0.7510897517204285	In terms of how we understand our economy but what is interesting about this quote is that the best way to appreciate how heroic was this constriction of vision is to notice what falls outside the field of vision.
1814240	1831456	B	0.5396539568901062	So what is missing from that is not the organizational principle of timber being valuable but everything that was not there or was being excluded treason bushes and planters and plants that hold little to non potential for that purpose.
1831568	1837920	B	0.5312930345535278	So missing out of that is floridiversity foliage, fruits, et cetera, twigs and branches.
1838000	1840704	B	0.6172648072242737	Missing out of that are insects and small animals.
1840752	1855128	B	0.8837395906448364	Depending on this diversity, all this ecological organization falls out of the organizational principle and that has very concrete consequences that we still suffer.
1855184	1865772	B	0.7921849489212036	Her we still live in the height of this climate crisis that also starts from this kind of thinking.
1865906	1887430	B	0.5286238193511963	So it has really very material consequences for us and had for them at the time, if you read more about it, that a timber, by trimming and domesticating nature, so much decreased in quality and then eventually decreased in value, which prompted them to try to reorganize that kind of story.
1888840	1889396	B	0.6755229234695435	And what?
1889418	1894216	B	0.6584243774414062	I want to call attention with the example is that also it brings some specific ways of talking about it.
1894238	1900612	B	0.7310272455215454	It brings vocabulary that only exists in terms of this type of practice specifically.
1900756	1908524	B	0.5098499655723572	So this vocabulary constrains nature in a way by pruning what cannot be used.
1908722	1916940	B	0.756496012210846	So it generates more than a legible nature, but a way of making nature intelligible and intelligible in a very specific certain way.
1917090	1922896	B	0.865894615650177	And we make that happen in terms of symbolizing things in specific terms.
1923078	1925504	B	0.5244631767272949	But the symbols, they don't exist in themselves.
1925622	1930964	B	0.8129739761352539	They exist only in organizing the social practice around them.
1931082	1937476	B	0.5264490842819214	So when you replace nature with a term called natural resources, we are doing exactly that.
1937658	1950072	B	0.7685030698776245	It's specifying from a generalized notion of nature like flora and fauna becomes something valuable, becomes a commodity but not everything, right?
1950126	1953332	B	0.840052604675293	It trims the practice.
1953476	1956248	B	0.6841792464256287	It separates competing species from value goods.
1956264	1963896	B	0.5005100965499878	So plants are symbolized as crops and the competing species are symbolized as weeds.
1963928	1975730	B	0.8422877192497253	They are not necessarily crops or weeds or anything like that in nature, but they are that for the way we talk like that because we practice agriculture in a certain way.
1977380	1982080	B	0.62349534034729	That's the same for insects or small animals that consume these interesting crops.
1982240	2007032	B	0.816476047039032	So the material effect of that and how that only gains traction in the practice over time and how you have specific intention that has unintended consequences are necessarily here situated contextualized and embodied in terms of trimming specific types of attention.
2007176	2040070	B	0.7992849349975586	And this attention will only shift to try to repopulate infect population, for instance, when you realize that this practice brought this specific effect in a certain way that affects the value of our understanding of nature and that generates exactly a type of social coherence and social coordination and how constraints create this coherence, right?
2043020	2050020	B	0.8011645078659058	Well now let's talk back again about formal semantics.
2050100	2066300	B	0.8373593091964722	While this formal semantics and active inference sort of embeds one type of mathematical formalism symbols can only be grounded in specific concrete practices or inaction.
2066640	2080624	B	0.8179041147232056	So while active inference can be used as a tool to explain social understanding, it does do that in terms of generalized synchronization in a model of cognition that can be inactive and dynamic.
2080672	2084944	B	0.8273453116416931	But this is still very general in terms of biosematics.
2084992	2102628	B	0.5708407163619995	We can think of it as a framework that might be compatible with active inference in terms of explaining the materiality of the environment in a non reductive, in a non reductionist way that tries to retain some naturalistic credentials.
2102804	2114700	B	0.8915387988090515	So how the conventions are affecting and affecting the embodied agent in terms of forming those symbols and cashing out those epistemic values.
2117460	2139990	B	0.7960312962532043	And well social interaction in this sense is not reduced to prediction because in this sense, the prediction will not be a primitive, but it will be a result of a specific participatory construction of the social scene over specific.
2141320	2158012	B	0.7115899920463562	Organizational principles and actions that, through the synchronization of these generative models, or the synchronization of those agents that can be described in terms of those generative models, gain predictive value.
2158146	2165020	B	0.8560106158256531	And when you model that then you have this type of understand the value of prediction in those senses.
2166400	2199790	B	0.6894734501838684	So that allows that allows us to say that social actors in this sense can behave as if they have a generative model that synchronizes with that symbolic state of affairs allowing them to understand each other's behaviors or to develop approximate informational sensitive or responsiveness to the same symbols and goals.
2200210	2208530	B	0.7173523902893066	They are approximate because they're obviously not going to be the same but they have the same approximate orientation.
2208950	2213982	B	0.7179521322250366	So in this sense, we don't have ever a view from nowhere.
2214126	2221074	B	0.5338866114616394	We don't have ever this view that is only cashed out in terms of specific types of minds.
2221122	2229670	B	0.8738399744033813	But you also have types of minds shaped in terms of these very concrete organizations.
2234920	2240804	B	0.826238214969635	That happens in a community, like for humans at least, it happens in community of language users.
2240932	2249692	B	0.7698073983192444	So their relationship with symbolic cues helps to select attention at that specific time as well.
2249746	2254776	B	0.6101223826408386	Pruning what should be ignored in socially constructed environments.
2254968	2273510	B	0.5371814370155334	So within a specific community of language users some types of actions will be desirable and will be deemed as true in that specific type of community and can be only evaluated under those terms.
2273960	2293320	B	0.8447217345237732	So you can provide reasons for actions in that specific context and you can talk about how rational that action is in terms of the conditions set by those communities.
2298230	2309400	B	0.745638906955719	And that brings us to the idea that human cognition in this sense is never decoupled from these cultural norms that pushes and orients them over time.
2309930	2312922	B	0.631700336933136	So in those scale of behavior and that's the interesting thing.
2312976	2334480	B	0.7567026615142822	And that's why active inference can be an interesting tool to model this type of human communities and this type of behavior because it can come from the very dynamics, the very basic of dynamics to specific types of perception and scale up and more.
2337860	2366510	B	0.661652684211731	So when you have the problem of symbols, like in these two decoupled possible community of users and symbols and embodied agents and things that do not combine, we can try to model our agents in a way that we don't have this problem anymore because you're trying to include that very component into the model.
2368880	2380530	B	0.7972400784492493	So in this sense, we have active inference used as tools to explain social understanding, as generalized synchronization and in understanding others.
2381140	2397536	B	0.6362206935882568	In that sense, because of this generalized synchronization model and assumed by those types of organizational principles, we can also engage in terms of niche construction.
2397648	2413980	B	0.8408339619636536	So we have a more or less deterministic way of understanding the nature of symbols because the more we interact and approximate synchronize with the environment, we change the environment that might change us back.
2414050	2424830	B	0.748097836971283	So you have an open system that is always and everywhere situated and key can be modeled then with this type of predictive value.
2425520	2449510	B	0.8393756151199341	So that's more or less what I had in mind and that's how I was trying to think about biosemiotics and in a possible relationship with free energy principle and the formalisms of yeah, I think this is it.
2458310	2458818	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2458904	2460210	A	0.9078418016433716	Thank you, Lorena.
2461030	2465922	A	0.8430300951004028	I'll just organize things a little in my room.
2465976	2469570	A	0.9879781007766724	But thank you very much for this excellent lecture.
2470330	2476440	A	0.8641992807388306	Just as a kind of warm up, how did you come to see it this way?
2477290	2497150	A	0.9120081663131714	What brought you to this general question of semantics and how do you see that like on your own path and see what other comparable or analogous approaches have been done in terms of a meta analysis and proposal related to the naturalization of semantics?
2501090	2503934	B	0.5877607464790344	I think it's kind of hard to naturalize semantics, right?
2503972	2506430	B	0.7227789759635925	I think there's a lot of effort in doing that.
2506500	2515970	B	0.6614435911178589	And it might be that if you think differently about how we naturalize those values, we might have better answers.
2518390	2524230	B	0.7419509887695312	Instead of trying to fit the agent into the model, we try to fit the model into the agent.
2524300	2524920	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
2526490	2527794	B	0.8114675283432007	I think that was the motivation.
2527842	2532438	B	0.8412519097328186	I think there's the interesting part of biosymptics in that sense.
2532524	2534810	B	0.7581319808959961	It tries to make less assumptions.
2535310	2541594	B	0.8502452373504639	When we start from a hardcore assumption or model assumption, right.
2541632	2550080	B	0.6847126483917236	That semantics is only within the mind, then we have a very hard time trying to explain that.
2550530	2560082	B	0.537168025970459	If you assume less about that, you might bring different types of explanations, of course, but they'd be more interesting.
2560216	2574280	B	0.7625395655632019	I was trying to see how that looks like when you bring these two things together in the terms of active inference and free energy principle, if that works, if that is possible.
2574970	2577160	B	0.53652024269104	I don't know if that answers your question.
2581570	2593940	A	0.8924095630645752	So wondering about that fundamental question and then coming across active inference or how elsewhere have people brought in the more formal and technical into this question?
2598150	2600722	B	0.8535548448562622	What do you mean by more formal?
2600786	2604710	B	0.6858843564987183	And can you repeat that, please?
2604780	2605110	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2605180	2612550	A	0.8847934603691101	How does active inference help us or have continuity or difference with previous ways that people have connected?
2612710	2624122	A	0.8947205543518066	The technical part from what you described as the formal semantics embeds the mathematical formalism, and then the symbols are grounded in specific action.
2624266	2628830	A	0.8936272859573364	So has that been played out in other technical frameworks?
2629250	2633582	B	0.8560894131660461	Well, we do have technical frameworks that try to organize that in terms of an activism right.
2633636	2635674	B	0.827592134475708	And autopoietic and activism.
2635802	2644238	B	0.6269833445549011	But then we just have in these terms, the notion of symbols sometimes get loosely described.
2644254	2646530	B	0.8545791506767273	And I think these guys are not really interested in that.
2646600	2669110	B	0.483233243227005	I think they're trying to describe something else, for example, or you can have some specific types of computational if you really buy into the mind computational brain and computational mind metaphor, then you have a hard time also to explain how semantics are built into that computation.
2669190	2669820	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2670190	2673482	B	0.5170647501945496	I don't think anyone has a very strong answer to that.
2673536	2676970	B	0.7175292372703552	You have to really buy into the idea of information processing.
2677130	2680846	B	0.7262088656425476	And that's what brought me a little bit to that.
2681028	2687726	B	0.7889894247055054	If you buy into the metaphor of information processing, then you need to have semantics within the brain.
2687838	2695860	B	0.7026802897453308	If you try to lose a little bit this notion, if you try to understand process and information in different terms, what happens?
2696390	2699638	B	0.8605197668075562	I think that was more or less the question that I was trying to ask.
2699804	2724750	B	0.4934636652469635	And if active inference and biosemiotics can, because they have less assumptions in terms of what happens inside the processing information content in the mind, if that can bring interesting answers or if you can use as a model to organize behavior.
2727810	2743540	B	0.8735989332199097	And there's another point that also brought me to this type of thinking, was trying to understand how active inference can include the historicity of the agent.
2743990	2744402	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2744456	2752950	B	0.8434008955955505	Because I think that something comes across debated in active inference, how you bring novelty into the state space.
2753020	2760966	B	0.8363901972770691	Like, once you define that state space, the state space is more or less deterministic because everything will happen within that specific range.
2760998	2767850	B	0.8433936834335327	So how does novelty comes within this type of modeling?
2768430	2771930	B	0.6567545533180237	So how can you explain that if it does?
2772000	2772860	B	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
2774450	2779998	B	0.8916307091712952	It's more like an exploratory question that I was trying to make and see how that pans out.
2780164	2782478	B	0.5456426739692688	I actually also don't have an answer for that.
2782644	2797170	B	0.5459281802177429	But if you take seriously some more inactive claims that you need history of interactions to understand how agents behave, you cannot understand agents without that.
2797320	2802790	B	0.8686842322349548	So how does active inference answer this question specifically?
2804250	2809618	B	0.8023748993873596	Right, because once yeah, I think that's still kind of debated.
2809794	2821686	B	0.8453704714775085	I'm not sure if there's new developments in this specific topic, but I remember I think two years ago was like this specific papers from Di Paulo.
2821718	2828554	B	0.9052670001983643	I think the Lane dawa Forking path is specifically focusing on that in the formalisms and et cetera.
2828682	2836420	B	0.5233981013298035	So I don't know if these two things can bring a little bit of more to the conversation, maybe not.
2838950	2839362	A	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2839416	2842066	A	0.8647395968437195	I'll just ask some more general questions.
2842168	2844494	A	0.5561980605125427	You're adding a lot with these thoughts.
2844622	2850230	A	0.843384861946106	So you said that social interaction in this account is not reduced to prediction.
2850890	2856440	A	0.8713882565498352	So how would you unpack that and how would you relate this?
2858810	2868890	A	0.8452916741371155	I don't know exactly what term of art would go here, but this kind of social epistemology that active inference provides us in contrast to say, predictive processing.
2869550	2873730	A	0.7418966293334961	So how is it that we would or wouldn't reduce something to prediction?
2873830	2878430	A	0.7761823534965515	And then what is it that active inference brings into that discussion?
2879490	2882046	B	0.7993186712265015	Yeah, well, I think I have two points in that.
2882068	2890500	B	0.866308867931366	Like, active inference in that sense has a type of modeling that tries to include all the time and everywhere the embodied agent.
2890870	2914698	B	0.5436721444129944	If you take seriously the idea, the generative model is always accurately modeling that specific agent because it cannot be true or false, your current state is like that even if you are not feeling really well, you just know that you're not feeling well in relation to something else.
2914784	2922220	B	0.5359379649162292	And that story is still very accurate to your state condition right now.
2922770	2923614	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2923812	2935694	B	0.6267245411872864	So the prediction gains traction socially at least in that sense, not in this specific detail of predictive processing, I think, because I think that's more complicated.
2935742	2962330	B	0.4762135446071625	But socially, in social cognition, at least we can talk about this predictive value, I think is a more interesting way to do that because the example that I use in terms of catching out symbols, we are using something that was meant to make something intelligible that have very bad consequences that were not even close to be predicted.
2962750	2970220	B	0.5173506736755371	So in that sense and how these consequences happen, prediction cannot be there everywhere and all the time.
2970990	2974240	B	0.8681273460388184	The prediction has an orientation as well, right?
2974770	2980430	B	0.8065990209579468	So that's going to unfold only in terms of the orientation, but that's not all encompassing.
2983570	2985318	B	0.8413419723510742	What does that say about the prediction?
2985354	2991570	B	0.8321055769920349	That's why I was trying to think of it as not being a primitive, but something that comes along with these dynamics.
2997450	3012550	A	0.7891054153442383	Well, this is a very deep impresscient point that because the causal structure of the world changes, historiosity agents change, they learn and they attend, and then the niche changes with stigma g and niche modification.
3012630	3037614	A	0.7336258292198181	So because things really do change through time, then just training a data set at one time point and then using that same generative model and carrying it forward, it's like picking a speed in a direction when you're on a winding road and just saying, all right, now let's turn on cruise control right now and just keep going in this direction.
3037662	3039140	A	0.761845588684082	It's working right now.
3040630	3052070	A	0.7113752365112305	So then to connect that to the legibility of the forests as the causal model changed and externalities were not taken into account and so on, all these different features you brought in.
3052220	3092820	A	0.7238466143608093	So now is active inference and cognitive modeling, cognitive technologies increasing our legibility of perception, cognition and action through surveillance technology and other mechanisms such that there could be we expect there to be also hidden dynamics and externalities that we are also failing to see when we make some aspects of cognitive systems legible in the way that research in the neurosciences is happening towards.
3094870	3109606	B	0.5322384238243103	Yeah, I think in the sense if you're trying to do that, you cannot have a no like in a model that encompasses everything, right, that would be non informative in terms of when you do that, you're interested in something, right?
3109708	3121494	B	0.848284125328064	You have one thing in mind when you're trying to flesh out in terms of cognitive modeling, how that applies to these more all encompassing situations.
3121542	3125294	B	0.8537752032279968	I think that's like that model is how I'm trying to ask this question.
3125412	3136260	B	0.7304965853691101	So you can model them in this sliced sense and that's what we do as scientists and that's how we learn about things.
3136630	3144610	B	0.6877744793891907	But that only way of seeing that very specific model is not all encompassing for all answers.
3145990	3150686	B	0.804903507232666	How can you use that in comparison to other situations?
3150718	3153094	B	0.5326177477836609	So how can you integrate this type of thing?
3153132	3153960	B	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3155130	3157382	B	0.5034075379371643	I don't have a question and an answer for that.
3157436	3164426	B	0.5188576579093933	I don't know if we do have an answer for this type of question currently.
3164528	3183626	B	0.6211299896240234	But I think it's a very valid question to ask because also in the terms of sometimes applying that socially, that sort of raifies in a way and then it becomes an organizing principle that becomes somewhat raified.
3183738	3200040	B	0.7312757968902588	So keep an eye for these kinds of metaphorical use, like assuming a little bit that all this talk can be metaphorical and it can be interesting and useful to catch them out in these terms because they don't have other ways to talk about them.
3201450	3217798	B	0.530634880065918	So how we don't Raify them and how they are, because I'm having a hard time to get there, but I think I'm making the point of people criticizing the causal primacy.
3217894	3233546	B	0.5807924270629883	So when you reduce these complex systems to one single cause, cashing out everything that organizes these complex systems in one primal cause, then you are losing the complexity.
3233738	3240306	B	0.6214237809181213	However, if you don't do that, how can you slice it out to understand the system?
3240488	3250340	B	0.7446101903915405	So I think that's the two tensions here that I'm kind of trying to propose as a question instead of an answer.
3251590	3255414	B	0.6679123640060425	I don't know if that makes sense, but are you thinking, yeah, I hope.
3255452	3257058	A	0.7902327179908752	People continue that discussion.
3257234	3262298	A	0.8648194670677185	I'm going to build on that just to kind of maybe circle around that because it's really important.
3262384	3282474	A	0.8374680876731873	So in the forestry case, the realist perspective, again using retro casting the way we or contemporary discussions, some of them in the active inference and free energy principle space are the realist says that region of land is just economic potential.
3282602	3286270	A	0.6744505167007446	It is a natural resource that becomes a kind of handle.
3286770	3294254	A	0.670814573764801	The instrumentalist perspective takes a step back and says it's as if that piece of land is a natural resource.
3294302	3298466	A	0.649688184261322	So, yeah, the territory is indescribable and there's still a space for mystery.
3298578	3334410	A	0.8155674338340759	But then when the proxies come out because policies are being selected, the as if in some ways carries similar consequences to the actual and they may totally agree and the realists and the instrumentalists might be like, yeah, it is economic potential or represents or it could be treated as such or it could be engaged with as such that cognitive diversity can align on the social policy that then connects to these broader social questions and histories.
3334570	3338514	A	0.8458046317100525	And so it's kind of interesting, like, what work does this instrumentalism do?
3338552	3340290	A	0.6786001324653625	Like, oh, it's just a principle.
3341670	3344482	A	0.7685351371765137	What work does it do and what doesn't it do?
3344616	3355270	A	0.8311168551445007	And the ways that science and technical engineering fields are and aren't deployed alone or together with other considerations.
3356250	3366362	B	0.5345659852027893	Yeah, that's very interesting in the sense I don't know if you're realist or instrumentalist about that, if you think models are not either true or false, they're just models, right.
3366416	3371846	B	0.8423138856887817	They might have used and they might be capturing real properties.
3371958	3389810	B	0.5480148792266846	But the problem is, in this conversation, even when you push them, like have realists and have an instrumentalist try to loosen up a little bit these assumptions, they still end up refine those principles and taking them to be more or less true or false.
3390150	3390850	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3391000	3392622	A	0.6674232482910156	Well, that's kind of a plot twist.
3392686	3403014	A	0.6333531737327576	It's like you're appealing to what surprise, minimization as unifying the diversity responses that the realist and instrumentalists do.
3403052	3413260	A	0.7809476256370544	So then does that make surprise or cognitive inertia, like the er principle where the maze just ends and it explains itself?
3413870	3418650	A	0.7885987758636475	Or how does that play in a pluralistic scientific setting?
3420110	3425920	B	0.8023414015769958	Yeah, you can have a third answer to that.
3429330	3438830	B	0.7851322293281555	I think the answer that I'm trying to give is more eliminativist in the sense that eliminates the cause of primacy of them, of these two modes of answering.
3441670	3446178	B	0.8423720598220825	I'm thinking I have in mind now, actually, just to try to make sense of that.
3446344	3453746	B	0.8534030318260193	When you think about biological information, you can think about biological information as being real, as being metaphorical and instrumental.
3453938	3462854	B	0.576767086982727	Or you have these guys like Susan Oyama or Richard lewantin, they try to bring some they are against this cause of primacy.
3462902	3470266	B	0.7080292105674744	They try to advocate for systems that do have that, but they have a lot of more going on.
3470368	3479210	B	0.6035845875740051	So that cannot be the only answer because those systems are not everywhere scientifically.
3480450	3482590	B	0.699863076210022	They don't have to be everywhere.
3483170	3488222	B	0.8352864980697632	That, for example, going back to the forestry.
3488286	3504070	B	0.7830092310905457	So the realist is going to say that territory is valued property in the sense the instrumental is going to say, look as if it can be used as if but it's not necessarily value property.
3504220	3505158	B	0.6714509725570679	It doesn't matter.
3505244	3514650	B	0.8392406105995178	You can say like, well, this terrain is seen from one perspective as value property, but it also has other uses around them.
3514720	3532474	B	0.7050014138221741	So you had to be more inclusive of this diversity because the only organizational principle around that specific terrain is not only to generate value or if it does, this value doesn't have one single output.
3532602	3538082	B	0.8715669512748718	It can have more than one output in terms of very specific terms.
3538136	3539534	B	0.5444116592407227	You can cash it out very materially.
3539582	3551766	B	0.7305175065994263	This terrain that has to provide monoculture, has to provide also value for the diversity of the fauna and the diversity of the flora around it.
3551868	3555798	B	0.7804672718048096	And that is not included in a model because that's not what the model is done for.
3555884	3559320	B	0.5719932913780212	The model has a specific use and that's fine.
3559690	3563020	B	0.8216521739959717	However, that does not reduce the terrain to that.
3564910	3597038	B	0.5451066493988037	Well when you're talking about cognition, that might be more complicated, but I think it's an easy way to talk about this cause of primacy when you talk about forestry because we are very much now experiencing this climate crisis and we see these things happening right now and how difficult because this type of thinking is built over time and so well fixed in the way we see things and we are understanding how hard is to change that.
3597204	3597894	B	0.4972243905067444	It not.
3597932	3602680	B	0.8019493818283081	It's a paradigm shift that needs to happen for that to change.
3603130	3610120	B	0.8096290826797485	It's not necessarily the model that is right or wrong, it's just how you understand and apply them.
3612010	3614634	B	0.8388608694076538	So there are pragmatics into that.
3614672	3620422	B	0.5087108612060547	It's not only an instrumental, but it has something that the instrumentalist take does not capture.
3620486	3626502	B	0.4736514687538147	And I don't know how to catch it out in one single word, but that's what Biosimatics was offering.
3626566	3631226	B	0.855650007724762	Biosymiatics was offering the idea of practice and pragmatics.
3631338	3636900	B	0.8402296900749207	I don't know if it's the whole story, but it's another point into that story.
3638950	3647278	A	0.8911223411560059	A lot of great points all connect that note of pragmatism to a little bit of the active inference formalism.
3647454	3657830	A	0.6676837801933289	So when it comes to policy selection, behavior selection, some, but not all cognitive entities can act as if they're calculating expected free energy.
3657980	3669894	A	0.8298690915107727	So these are the active, the truly active entities, whether they're simple or whether they're sophisticated and they do planning expected free energy is how those agents are being modeled, as if they're making decisions.
3670022	3673502	A	0.8221002221107483	And it consists of the pragmatic and the epistemic value.
3673556	3675706	A	0.8353901505470276	That's how these different policies are evaluated.
3675818	3689938	A	0.5797116756439209	And so I see two angles or windows that that supports, at least from my non social sciences background, a new kind of meeting in the middle there.
3690104	3700998	A	0.8668826222419739	So first is the expansion of pragmatic value under the principle that surprise, minimization or bounding is the imperative right there in the pragmatic value.
3701084	3706370	A	0.7968352437019348	It doesn't have to be just body temperature or financial income.
3706530	3712234	A	0.5575779676437378	We can expect and prefer ourself to be learning new things or meeting new people.
3712352	3724298	A	0.8119732141494751	And so we can load into the pragmatism different goals that under a narrower definition of utility or pragma have not traditionally been included.
3724314	3732414	A	0.5573177933692932	So I think that first way is it speaks to a more inclusive concept of utility, you might say.
3732452	3739550	A	0.6935533881187439	I'm also derisking on forest fires alongside the timber and already you have now plural pragma.
3739630	3747310	A	0.7920148372650146	So I think that's the kind of crossover and then the deeper and second and not saying there's only two ways that the conversation continues.
3747390	3771210	A	0.7938927412033081	We have epistemic utility in terms of epistemic value and so the balance and the weighting between pragmatic value and epistemic or learning oriented activity overall helps control a dynamics balance with just like how tight is the grip and the preference overall.
3771870	3779934	A	0.7095107436180115	And maybe we have some preference for timber to be exported from a region but we really don't know.
3779972	3783322	A	0.5982411503791809	We don't have long term modeling, we don't have deep causal analysis.
3783466	3806386	A	0.8079323172569275	And so we're going to put 5% on the pragmatic extraction and other pragmatic features and leave the rest of the policy in an exploratory mode and come to a blend that's not just on the spectrum from explore to exploit, which is how this has been approached in cognitive sciences previously.
3806578	3817354	A	0.6465240120887756	It's like this is the third thing where policies that are on the frontier of exploring and exploiting rise to the top through their contributions to pragmatic and epistemic value.
3817472	3818986	A	0.7447415590286255	And we made the model.
3819168	3825710	A	0.7414474487304688	So that isn't to say that that is what's happening on the ground or maybe that's just the instrumentalist perspective.
3829650	3835870	B	0.7350138425827026	Yeah, but if it's an instrumentalist perspective, it might be a good one, right?
3835940	3841074	B	0.8322763442993164	In the sense the idea of inclusion is kind of the interesting one.
3841112	3841362	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3841416	3853090	B	0.8234793543815613	Because if you refine the notion of maximization because you can use that in certain ways to understand what happens within when you're modeling something, what is the limit of that maximization?
3853170	3859058	B	0.8284048438072205	So you can model agents as if maximizing utility, for instance.
3859234	3867034	B	0.7317007780075073	But maximizing utility is something that needs to be balanced out with utility of everyone around them.
3867072	3867660	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3868350	3871578	B	0.5898215174674988	And that's not trivial how that happens.
3871664	3871962	B	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3872016	3885120	B	0.5108387470245361	And even if it does, and even if it were trivial, it's not something that maps out completely identically with every single agent.
3886770	3888402	B	0.5107051134109497	There's going to be diversity there.
3888536	3895362	B	0.7935371398925781	So how do you make that notion more inclusive and less raified in that sense?
3895496	3904498	B	0.6813245415687561	Because then if the more you Raify, the more you single it out into around only one general type of understanding.
3904674	3918838	B	0.611325740814209	So when you think them more individually, then you lose that strength of this one single principle organized, one single way of cashing out utility.
3918934	3920038	B	0.5307603478431702	That's not the principle.
3920134	3920780	B	0.5092127919197083	Sorry.
3922110	3936218	B	0.8846347332000732	So I think that speaks a lot with the type of instrumental use and the type of pragmatism, the types of application of these practices.
3936314	3936730	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
3936820	3942110	B	0.8616421222686768	Remember, in the sense of the scientific forestry, it's also a practice.
3942190	3950486	B	0.5835074782371521	It's not something that is true in itself, it's true in terms of practice, right, in terms of applications, in terms of building communities around them.
3950588	3954630	B	0.6100626587867737	So without this use they have no grounding.
3957210	3965770	A	0.6659491658210754	Yeah, one really strong and salient point that I got from the lecture was about generalized synchrony.
3966350	3978506	A	0.5043343901634216	And it's almost funny that we have to advocate or delineate generalized synchrony because the alternative, the absence of generalized synchrony is just like kind of like an ideal gas.
3978698	4000200	A	0.5190650224685669	It's like there wouldn't be regularities in society, we wouldn't be clustered in space or in time, we wouldn't have information and communication and we wouldn't have what differentiates a society or a group or a civilization or a colony or whatever from literally anything else.
4000650	4013782	A	0.7332775592803955	So generalized synchrony is almost like all of the space between nothing and anything happening and then it supports all these different scenarios.
4013846	4020806	A	0.7521489262580872	We could have this kind of mind in this kind of brain in this kind of environment and this kind of niche.
4020918	4034830	A	0.8572843670845032	And so we can talk about the ant colony foraging algorithms that work in the desert and there might be mutual, nonexhausted, open ended change of algorithms and what works in a different setting.
4035350	4072054	A	0.8039432764053345	And with humans we have the sophistication and the history and the scope and the scale and all of these metas and weaving with is and ought and our own forward going direction, which is really the moment where it goes from being a forensic sociology to the real time sense making and action selection based upon our cognitive models.
4072182	4075390	A	0.8795279860496521	In the broader sense, which includes humans and non human agents.
4075460	4090820	A	0.6933420896530151	But it's like that's when it goes from being more than just an understanding, when that understanding translates to an action policy and they do, then it matters as much as anything does.
4093110	4093860	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4094230	4105270	B	0.625959575176239	One of the criticism of the active inference, I think common is like it is too general to single out specific constraints that orient action.
4105850	4138442	B	0.6393867135047913	That's what I thought thinking about how symbols are brought about in community of language users, assuming that the symbols are not they are only meaningful throughout these histories and practices can help us to apply this type of general yeah, navigating specific, well, epistemic communities.
4138506	4145522	B	0.8375218510627747	And I think that's the work that Maho is going to bring along in terms of epistemic communities and then you single out in them.
4145576	4155430	B	0.8912107944488525	So you have these communities of language users in which specific practices create specific orientations.
4157210	4157862	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4157996	4172198	A	0.868314266204834	One thought on that asking like what does active inference or linear regression or some other method again, this is who knows, is this just deep esoteric instrumentalism?
4172374	4175410	A	0.8587838411331177	But asking what does it have to say about this symbol?
4175510	4179230	A	0.8466953635215759	What does active inference have to say about the letter E in English?
4180930	4196638	A	0.7730505466461182	Can it be as simple as to say that that's a category error and that you could make a toy example or a pedagogical example where symbol one and symbol two oscillate in a multi agent simulation or you could make a generative model for an alphabet and leave it abstract.
4196734	4212810	A	0.5108463168144226	But you're never going to connect to the historiosity and the real enactment of the English letter E unless you're confronting the minute particulars and the actual embodiment of that letter.
4213470	4222650	A	0.8314930200576782	And then there's different course grainings, different iterated modeling decisions, different questions about how do you include and participate in the different stages of the scientific process.
4222720	4230654	A	0.561338484287262	But it's like you're in the specifics at that point, active inference doesn't have an opinion on the letter E because we wouldn't want it to.
4230772	4232974	A	0.7592340707778931	It would be too opinionated about the wrong things.
4233012	4250194	A	0.5572426319122314	It'd be making assumptions and bringing axioms into play that would be extremely constraining and so it remains general as a framework and the free energy principle even more differently.
4250242	4255318	A	0.7961679697036743	So but when we get into the actual, that's where we're connecting to the real systems of interest.
4255484	4267660	A	0.5130918025970459	But how could we make claims and advance them socially about systems of interest when we're not even it's like comparing bridge building as a concept with this bridge right here.
4268430	4272730	A	0.5194038152694702	It's a little bit like a category disconnect.
4275650	4280720	B	0.781482994556427	Yeah, well, it depends also how you single out some things.
4281490	4284190	B	0.8402108550071716	You just don't do that because they're just not interesting enough.
4284260	4284842	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4284996	4295170	B	0.5910152196884155	There's nothing that comes out of it in terms of this bridge right here in a single how did you put it again?
4295240	4307880	B	0.8266728520393372	Like a category of bridges and this bridge right here, right when you do that you can learn something about the category in terms of this single one right here.
4308650	4316282	B	0.7197321057319641	But it's not exhaustive that's I think one point it's not exhaustive and it's not right or wrong.
4316336	4326622	B	0.5261143445968628	It might be better than other I think they did you can make some comparisons in terms of predictive value.
4326676	4332350	B	0.554916262626648	You can have better or worse ways of doing it and then it gains more utility.
4333570	4347950	A	0.7343547940254211	Okay, connecting this to also this non exhaustive nature and where the power of a generalizable framework is let's talk about the category of Golden Gate Bridges in San Francisco.
4348110	4352278	A	0.568174421787262	So there's only one actual bridge there, but we're generalizing it.
4352284	4358966	A	0.8515095710754395	And so somebody makes a state space and says well, I'm exploring if there was more than two end to end.
4359068	4370650	A	0.8807087540626526	So they're exploring the state space of topologies of bridge and someone else is exploring the state space of color and somebody else is exploring the state space of traffic dynamics and someone else is combining two of them or combining all three of them.
4370800	4382640	A	0.8858516812324524	And then that's the conversation is which map of this category of state spaces, category of adjacent possibles as we chose to model it.
4383330	4389150	A	0.5008915066719055	And if you don't include traffic flow, don't be surprised that it's not going to take that kind of data or make that kind of prediction.
4389310	4394030	A	0.7664511203765869	And some variables matter and some matter in combination and some don't.
4394190	4407560	A	0.8779048919677734	But when we model, we kind of build these regions or adjacencies to the actual which is where the historiosity of the past leaves us.
4408410	4422650	A	0.7183272242546082	And then we have an adjacent possible as modelers and sense makers including absurd counterfactuals and state spaces and then the state spaces are mobilized.
4426340	4427184	B	0.6076788306236267	Yeah, in a way.
4427222	4435996	B	0.8019271492958069	But if you talk about specific type of engineering yes, in that sense they are mobilized and they are not true or false.
4436028	4439570	B	0.635689914226532	You can use false models that still function.
4442260	4446420	B	0.5592330098152161	You can have specific uses of things that you know they're not really true.
4446490	4460996	B	0.6006340980529785	Like the thing, the taleric type of modeling, the solar system, they still use that to navigate in the desert even though it's not really accurate.
4461028	4467324	B	0.7498277425765991	But if you want to go from A to B, it helps you to do that, that's a different thing.
4467362	4467950	B	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4468400	4492710	B	0.7544354796409607	It's not true or false, but when you think about agents in terms of and if bringing back to the idea of symbols being only cashed out in terms of community of users that have histories and they are made useful, they are made meaningful in terms of their practices, then you don't have ever this disconnect, right?
4493400	4499008	B	0.8852413296699524	You can think about this cognition is always connected to this specific types of practicing.
4499104	4507450	B	0.7743630409240723	You can even single out some moments of it and try to see what you learn from this kind of slice of time.
4508620	4525600	B	0.7400966882705688	But when you think about the whole story of the cognitive system, if you're going to really think of it in terms that is valuable, you cannot disconnect from the state, let's say the state space of its practice.
4528100	4528656	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4528758	4529410	B	0.6177208423614502	Well.
4532260	4540916	A	0.932190477848053	Do you have any closing thoughts or what are you looking forward to with the discussion section and the rest of the course?
4541018	4543844	A	0.8705548048019409	Just by way of wrapping up and letting people know?
4543882	4545860	A	0.8144208192825317	Any other thoughts?
4546440	4552376	B	0.889281153678894	Yeah, would be cool to explore this idea that we've been actually bringing along here, right?
4552478	4570300	B	0.8219587802886963	How we can go with that instrumentally, realistically or how can we understand this general synchronization of the model in terms of specific instantiations and how informative they are?
4570370	4571804	B	0.7096378207206726	Is that really interesting?
4571922	4579084	B	0.6322451233863831	Or how can these things be actually raised in terms of modeling?
4579132	4584736	B	0.6631360650062561	And if that happens, does that have any specific consequences actually or not?
4584838	4585810	B	0.6598692536354065	Maybe not.
4588470	4589218	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4589384	4593342	A	0.9674537777900696	Well, very ambitious and excellent lecture.
4593406	4596660	A	0.9712010025978088	So thank you very much Lorena, and talk to you.
4597670	4601062	B	0.8081526756286621	Just keep in mind I was just like trying to ask these questions.
4601116	4602870	B	0.5192256569862366	I don't also have those answers.
4603690	4609922	B	0.5521636605262756	I found very little about active inference and semiotics produced.
4609986	4612434	B	0.7308734059333801	I found a few papers.
4612482	4614934	B	0.5717875361442566	So that's very exploratory actually.
4615132	4620520	B	0.644340455532074	So you're invited to think of these things and explore a little bit them further if it's possible.
4621690	4622150	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
4622220	4622818	A	0.5189363360404968	Epic.
4622914	4623718	A	0.4896698594093323	All right.
4623884	4624578	A	0.9327930808067322	Thank you, Lauren.
4624594	4625790	A	0.7262905836105347	I see you in a couple of weeks.
4625900	4626750	A	0.5942321419715881	Farewell.
4627170	4627546	B	0.5842206478118896	Ciao.
4627578	4627690	B	0.5137447118759155	Bye.
