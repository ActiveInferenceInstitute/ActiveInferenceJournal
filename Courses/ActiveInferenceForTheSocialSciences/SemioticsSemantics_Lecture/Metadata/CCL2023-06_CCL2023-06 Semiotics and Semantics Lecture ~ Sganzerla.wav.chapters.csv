6830	101230	00:06	This is the course active inference for the social sciences in 2023. Today we're in the semiotics and semantics section. We'll be hearing a lecture from Lorena Zegenzerla. Let's talk about active inference, formal semantics, and social cognition.	Semiotics and semantics section lecture from Lorena Zegenzerla	Active Inference for the Social Sciences (
104930	146190	01:44	I'm going to talk a little bit of theories of meaning and how shared symbols and social cognition can be thought together. Let me know what you think in the comments and after we can have a little discussion or in the next session.	We're going to talk about theories of meaning and social cognition	Social Cognition and the Free Energy Principle
148050	443534	02:28	The problem of meaning has a brief account, right? Like, traditionally approaches of to cognition, localize meaning inside individual organisms and more specifically, inside their minds. We need a broader understanding to cash this meaning out and that's where I'm stepping from.	How do we align motivations to behavior in interactions between biological agents	How does meaning come about in language?
443572	698830	07:23	So talk about mental content, about intentionality, about mental representations. We need truth conditions that denote this specific relationship. And there is also biosemiotics which concerns the use and the interpretation of signs and symbols. It emphasizes the embodied nature and the situated nature of meaning.	Semantics talk about mental content, about intentionality and about mental representations	Seminology and Biosemiotics
700530	967554	11:40	In biosemiotics we have the pragmatics and you have the practice and they relate to dynamics and context dependent. That's when I was thinking how we can bring this free energy principle and active inference in terms of those relationships.	Free energy principle and active inference help model biological behavior	In the world of biosemiotics and active inference
967672	1149242	16:07	You have flow states and have belief updating. They're going to be stated here as complementary. Active inference should be a novelty in relation to older forms of understanding organisms. It provides a unifying perspective on formal approaches connecting behavior and dynamics.	You have flow states and have belief updating which are complementary	Bayesian inference on belief updating and flow states
1149386	1758700	19:09	Under the free energy principle, representations can be formal. How can active inference be compatible to biosematics? Can it be actually compatible or is it even necessary? And think about scientific forestry as a scientific practice.	Free energy principle a principle for formal semantics? So what would be formal semantics	Bayesian formalism and formal semantics
1759680	2040070	29:19	When you replace nature with a term called natural resources, we are doing exactly that. It's specifying from a generalized notion of nature like flora and fauna becomes something valuable, becomes a commodity but not everything. This vocabulary constrains nature in a way by pruning what cannot be used.	Trimming and domesticating nature affects value of our understanding of nature	The constriction of the value of nature
2043020	2449510	34:03	Active inference can be used as a tool to explain social understanding. It does that in terms of generalized synchronization in a model of cognition that can be inactive and dynamic. Social interaction in this sense is not reduced to prediction.	Active inference can be used to explain social understanding, as generalized synchronization	Inactive Inference and Social Science
2458310	2577160	40:58	It's hard to naturalize semantics, right? And it might be that if you think differently about how we naturalize those values, we might have better answers. biosymptics tries to make less assumptions. If you assume less about that, you might bring different types of explanations.	Biosymptics tries to make less assumptions about semantics	The Naturalization of Semantic Thinking
2581570	2724750	43:01	How does active inference help us or have continuity or difference with previous ways that people have connected? If you buy into the metaphor of information processing, then you need to have semantics within the brain. And if active inference and biosemiotics can, if that can bring interesting answers.	How does active inference help us or have continuity with previous ways	Active Inference and Biosemiotics
2727810	2836420	45:27	Trying to understand how active inference can include the historicity of the agent. How does novelty come within this type of modeling? It's more like an exploratory question that I was trying to make and see how that pans out.	Active inference can include the historicity of the agent	Inactive Inference and Normality
2838950	3257058	47:18	Social interaction in this account is not reduced to prediction. Active inference in that sense has a type of modeling that tries to include all the time and everywhere the embodied agent. How can you use that in comparison to other situations?	You say that social interaction in this account is not reduced to prediction	Social Cognition: Not Reduced to Prediction
3257234	3563020	54:17	In the forestry case, the realist perspective says that region of land is just economic potential. The instrumentalist perspective takes a step back and says it's as if that land is a natural resource. How does that play in a pluralistic scientific setting?	Realists and instrumentalists disagree on whether land is valued property	Instrumentalism and Realism: The Case for Diversity
3564910	3954630	59:24	Raison: Biosymiatics was offering the idea of practice and pragmatics. It speaks to a more inclusive concept of utility, you might say. Policies that are on the frontier of exploring and exploiting rise to the top through their contributions to pragmatic and epistemic value.	Biosymiatics was offering the idea of practice and pragmatics	Instrumental and pragmatics
3957210	4332350	1:05:57	When it goes from being more than just an understanding, when that understanding translates to an action policy then it matters as much as anything. One of the criticism of the active inference is like it is too general to single out specific constraints that orient action. The work that Maho is going to bring along in terms of epistemic communities.	One strong and salient point that I got from the lecture was about generalized synchrony	Generalized Inclusion and the Cognition
4333570	4528656	1:12:13	When we model, we kind of build these regions or adjacencies to the actual which is where the historiosity of the past leaves us. And then we have an adjacent possible as modelers and sense makers including absurd counterfactuals. You cannot disconnect from the state, let's say the state space of its practice.	When we model, we build adjacencies to the actual	Generalizable frameworks of the cognitive system
4528758	4627690	1:15:28	Well. Do you have any closing thoughts or what are you looking forward to with the discussion section and the rest of the course? Would be cool to explore this idea that we've been actually bringing along here. I see you in a couple of weeks. Farewell.	Do you have any closing thoughts or what are you looking forward to with the discussion section	A Final Lecture
