2040	45210	00:02	Active Inference for the Social Sciences. Complex systems and feedbacks with cyberphysical systems will be a theme. With no further ado, I will pass it to please mute turn off the live stream Avil.	Welcome to the first introductory session of the Social Sciences course in 2023	Intermediate Course Introduction
45740	116560	00:45	I will pass now to Avil for the introductory session. If you're watching live, please feel free to write any comments or questions in the chat and I'll relay them at the end onto the lecture. Make sure to close the YouTube video or mute it.	If you're watching live, please feel free to write any comments or questions	Introduction to the LSAT
117650	374160	01:57	Kerriu is a funding member of Kairos Research and Active Inference Lab, which co organize the course. What we are going for here is basically explain the basic demarch of the course and present a few case study. And then we will talk about course layout.	Kerriu will present the teaching team for this course	Introduction to the course
374690	803480	06:14	What does explaining cultural dynamics even mean? There are many types or views on what is scientific explanation. We explain things by calling on to regularities always. In my opinion it is more a question of rhetorics than of epistemology.	What does explaining cultural dynamics even mean? Depends who talks	The Explanation of Cultural Dynamics
804750	1494290	13:24	Active inference can explain how regularities underlying social activity be constructed through time. If active inference framework is true, then cognitive agents perceive the world through expectation they have developed about the world. The prediction it also underlies action or policies.	Active inference theory claims that cognitive agents perceive world through expectations	Active Inference and the evolution of social regulatories
1495030	1728880	24:55	Azure setting is something that is situated in the work on public opinion. Used to study how mass media can manufacture consent by drawing attention to specific issues and shaping specific expectation about the world. This is something we should definitely pay attention to.	Azure setting is used to study how mass media can manufacture consent	Ajana Setting and Political Theory
1729910	1968090	28:49	The idea that we have ethnicities and this is somehow relevant, normatively, like the Slav should organize together. It's very recent. It dates from the 19th century. But states that legitimize themselves through nationhoods they have basically to be all the time invested in ethnic cleansing.	Second case study nationalism is about how states legitimize themselves through nationalism	Case Study 2: Nationalism
1968770	2215770	32:48	The African Renaissance monument is a good example of identity capture. It gives a blueprint around which society should be organized. All of this is mediated by self model. People follow norms and this is a way to broadcast norms.	Abdullah Wade illustrates concept of identity capture through African Renaissance monument	Idealism and Identity Capture
2216610	2431250	36:56	There are constant debates in every subfield possible of social sense regarding what is actually explained by structure and what is left to individual agency. If you accept that agency is built through normativity, you have to admit that software exists at least in part through agency.	There is a constant question about structure and agency in social life	Structure and agency
2432710	2611980	40:32	Active inference can afford indirectly an archaeology of cognitive landscape. If socialization is made of constraint over behavior and those constraints are to some extent Embedded in the natural environment of the people, then we can study archaeological landscape for themselves.	Active inference can afford indirectly an archaeology of cognitive landscape	Active Inference in the Archaeology of Cognition
2613790	3132674	43:33	The next four days will be about the basics of active inference. The ability to be understood by the state. The capacity for administration, the capacity for written symbols that tell what things are. This is relevant to active inference because in active inference, it is productive of what cognition you have.	Scott's book focuses on how states understand the world through written forms	Inference and the state
3132792	3224670	52:12	I do not think that we are in capacity to give standardized normalized degree or attestation that has any value. So asking you to do things, to do projects is a bit weird if we're not going to grade it. In future versions, but absolutely in future offerings, we will have these kinds of courses.	We considered making projects, but we decided not to do it	Oh, one last thing
3225570	3271326	53:45	The only way to reduce uncertainty is through active engagement. One is literally applying active inference when they do actively engage in this epistemic way. Like what you want or what you perceive will be here. So I hope that all comes through.	Please tell us what you expect out of this live chat	Active Inference and the Uncertain Future
3271508	3842946	54:31	Do active inference provide us with predictive power, potentially focusing on human or social scale issues? What does it look like? Or where would you say active inference provides us with unique explanations and predictions?	Robin: Does active inference provide us with predictive power or unique explanations	Inactive Inference and its predictive power
3843048	3956554	1:04:03	 Manufacturing Consent is from a 30s book Public Opinion by Walter Lickman that founded the whole public opinion thing. Is public opinion just like a pile of sand? Or does public opinion represent a singular integrated unit in its own respect?	I believed Manufacturing Consent was a Chomsky thing, but it is not	Noam Chomsky on Public Opinion
3956752	4010540	1:05:56	Does a pile of sand have semantics for an observer or for itself? Good question. Not really for itself. But I can put together brain and public opinion. Complex adaptive systems in an unfavorable sense.	Does a pile of sand have semantics for an observer or for itself	Does a pile of sand have semantics? For an observer or for
4011070	4429610	1:06:51	Please further contrast the terms regimes of attention and sociocultural landscapes. A landscape is a space that you can gaze at. It does not have a clear mathematical meaning it should have. If anyone has other thoughts or questions, we can consider them.	Please further contrast the terms regimes of attention and sociocultural landscapes	Cognitive Landscape and Sociocultural Landscape
4430030	4667510	1:13:50	Avel: Attraction goes very naturally with thinking about attention. So I guess it kind of entails the notion of attractors and repellers. I wonder if this is a useful kind of linguistic tool for visualizing the relationship between social cognitive landscapes and attention.	There's a couple of words that I was expecting to creep into this discussion	Attentors and Repellers in dynamical systems
4668680	4817812	1:17:48	Science build good models. Good models are competent engagement. The question of how to build a sense that is effective to information is basically the question that funded Kairos. But you would need heavy level of reform institution of science to get this process be more ergonomic, efficient, compelling and socially influential.	Science does a beautiful job of describing and building testable predictions of reality	How to Build a More Effective Science
4817866	4991390	1:20:17	Bayesian statistics qualitatively equates to the explicit provisioning of our priors and how we update those prior beliefs. Question of how to engage with extant institutions and norms and practices is a challenging and ongoing work. What I will be talking about is some things that did come up briefly today.	Bayesian statistics helps us understand how we update prior beliefs as new observations come in	Bayesian statistics and human subjective experience
4991760	5311400	1:23:11	In this section, I want to build up a nicely layered picture of what it's like to be an active inference agent in the world. I'm going to talk a little bit about folk psychology and motivated action. In the discussion session for my section, we'll have a special guest as well.	Next section looks at what it's like to be an active inference agent	Predictive Processing and Active Inference in Psychology
5313530	5548100	1:28:33	The closest proxy would be those prediction error things in the brain. Free energy and expected free energy are statistical calculations about statistical models. Whatever you put in your model is either an observable or a proposed latent hidden state. How prediction error is not always a bad thing.	Brynn asks about variational free energy and expected free energy	No variational free energy or expected free energy
5550310	5580570	1:32:30	Great. I encourage everybody to submit questions through the course website. All of the teachers will review the questions and we'll give the best answers we can. From all backgrounds, we would love to hear your voice in the discussions. See you next week.	We encourage people to submit questions through the course website	The First week
