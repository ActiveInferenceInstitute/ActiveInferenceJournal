6480	7436	2	B	0.93411	All right.
7618	9388	3	B	0.99998	Hello and welcome everyone.
9554	20780	4	B	0.99999	It is July 7, 2023, and we are in the first introductory session of the course, active Inference for the Social Sciences.
21120	28790	5	B	0.99998	This is going to be a really exciting course and journey that we're all going to join and co create together.
29320	34820	6	B	0.99419	With no further ado, I will pass it to please mute turn off the live stream Avil.
36600	37590	7	B	0.99767	Thank you.
38120	43412	8	B	0.95659	Complex systems and feedbacks with cyberphysical systems will be a theme.
43556	45210	9	B	0.99964	We told you it would be.
45740	49364	10	B	1.0	I will pass now to Avil for the introductory session.
49412	57864	11	B	0.99992	If you're watching live, please feel free to write any comments or questions in the chat and I'll relay them at the end onto the lecture.
57912	58940	12	B	0.99985	Thanks, Abel.
71160	72390	13	B	0.99826	Go for it.
85270	87026	14	A	0.76565	So, hi, do you hear me?
87048	89074	15	A	0.99833	Well, there was a sound issue.
89192	90260	16	A	0.93	Okay, cool.
91110	93862	17	A	0.91566	So I'm avoid I organized, I guess, the course.
93916	98630	18	A	0.86	I had the idea and worked on the curriculum.
99930	101202	19	A	0.9995	Do you see the slides?
101266	101880	20	C	0.9958	Well.
104330	104934	21	B	0.99973	Looks good.
104972	108300	22	B	0.99	And just make sure to close the YouTube video or mute it.
108910	110666	23	A	0.96849	So, hi, do you hear me?
110688	112374	24	A	0.88285	Well, that was Sunday.
112422	112778	25	A	0.7047	Sure.
112864	113900	26	A	0.6	Okay, cool.
114510	114874	27	A	0.72	Okay.
114912	116560	28	A	1.0	I did not know I had to do that.
117650	123630	29	A	0.87071	So this is the introduction session of the course.
123700	125034	30	A	0.99846	Very unsurprisingly.
125162	127370	31	A	0.99997	My name is Kerriu.
127530	138180	32	A	1.0	I am a funding member of Kairos Research and I am a non funding member of Active Inference Lab, which co organize the course.
139910	143974	33	A	0.99	And first I will basically present the teaching team.
144172	163340	34	A	0.99203	So we have Danielle, which is with us, which is a PhD in Ecology and Evolution, studying ants behavior in an eco evo kind of way, who is a president and co founder of the Enactive Transitutes and who is interested in, among the things art, philosophy and cognitive security.
163870	183742	35	A	1.0	Then we have Ben, which is also here with us, which is a second year PhD candidate in Philosophy at the University of Sussex, which, like me, interested four E cognition, which is Embodied, Enactive, Embedded and Extended cognition.
183806	186050	36	A	0.99986	We don't need to get into that now.
186120	187410	37	A	0.99519	He will explain to you.
187560	193640	38	A	0.99	And in Enactive Processing, which is basically working on the cognitive science of technology.
194010	216870	39	A	0.82	And then we have people who are not here today, which are mao Albarasa, PhD candidate in the Cognitive Computing at University Morielo, which is head of Product Innovation and Research at versus private sector research lab in AI and the mathematics of AI, which specializes in wildlife inference.
216950	230690	40	A	0.71	The theory we're working on right now, script theory, which she will Extended maybe I will talk a bit of it today, but she will be the one who explains what script theory is to you and modern artificial intelligence.
231030	250390	41	A	0.6	And we have Lauren Gonzala, also a PhD candidate, also in philosophy, but in Wollongong, I believe this is how you say it in Australia, which is centered in philosophy of mind and in the status of information processing, as the term is used in cognitive science.
251690	252950	42	A	0.99	And then there is me.
253020	257814	43	A	0.97406	So I made a career timeline because when I talk about what I did, people get confused.
257862	261494	44	A	1.0	I did physics, math, I did engineering, I did cognitive science.
261542	263574	45	A	1.0	I did research in ecology and evolution.
263702	280722	46	A	1.0	I did a master's in complex system physics, and I did, like, one year, apparently, given my timeline or two, no, more than more, two of independent research as part of kerose research and as part of the French Society of Cliodynamics before I started the PhD I'm doing now.
280776	285854	47	A	0.99999	Which is something about the enaction between mind and material culture.
285902	288340	48	A	0.99985	We will get into that at some point.
289350	295714	49	A	1.0	And the question motivation I have are essentially describing the relation between phenomenology.
295762	306310	50	A	0.99911	So the way we experience the world and physical reality, which I have the fringe view that somehow phenomenology is constructive of physical reality, which could have weak and strong interpretation.
306390	307980	51	A	0.74	I subscribe to both.
308590	322654	52	A	0.97226	I'm trying maybe more importantly here to explain or at least describe how sociocultural life form, let us say the regularities that in the life, social life, human social life are constructed, which is hard.
322772	333620	53	A	0.97	And I'm trying to build a research that is effective at doing knowledge, not word piles through our work in Kairos research.
334070	336446	54	A	0.99394	So these are specific reference.
336558	345000	55	A	0.57	You will get the slides at some point I guess I will publish them on the website and then we will be able to check it out if this is of interest to you.
346010	350120	56	A	0.99982	So let us get on the actual relevant content.
350490	369902	57	A	0.99884	So what we are going for here is basically explain the very basic demarch of the course, explain how it's of relevance, how the framework we propose is of relevance to social science and present a few case study to make the case.
369956	372154	58	A	1.0	And then we will talk about course layout.
372202	374160	59	A	0.99852	But this is pretty quick.
374690	381166	60	A	0.9395	So first I'd like to talk about the explanation of cultural dynamics.
381358	385380	61	A	0.99976	What does explaining cultural dynamics even mean?
386310	387890	62	A	0.27789	Depends who talks.
388550	396390	63	A	0.54216	There are many types or views on what is scientific explanation.
396890	400802	64	A	1.0	I say we can cluster them in three broad categories.
400946	404070	65	A	0.64	One is numerological, so it's about laws.
404230	413558	66	A	1.0	And what it does is to take regularities, just say here is this regularity and consider that these statements.
413654	419418	67	A	0.99213	So the law has an explanatory capacity toward the regularity.
419594	436510	68	A	0.99702	So for example, for those of you who are familiar with the work of, and I forget names, foundation, the foundation trilogy, I believe it's trilogy.
436670	439538	69	A	0.99987	This is pretty close to what they call psycho history.
439624	454214	70	A	0.99962	So basically trying to find laws of behavior and using them to predict history in a regular lawful way, then we have mechanical explanation which are more typical of the life science.
454342	467280	71	A	1.0	And what we do in mechanical explanation is to look at the structure of a system and model the structure and try to use this model to predict specific regularities that are of interest.
467890	486530	72	A	1.0	And you have approach to social sense that is I'd say quite close to that which is Cliodynamics, which waits a lot on the Nomological side but still is centered on dynamics and mechanisms and explanation by calling onto structure in specific societies.
487270	496006	73	A	1.0	And then you have a functional explanation which asks what constraints exist so that the system does what it is that the system does.
496108	503702	74	A	0.80657	Here again, you will also use a lot of contextual modeling, very often evolutionary game theory.
503766	524874	75	A	0.98879	So simulation where we suppose that agent can have specific traits and those that reproduce more or that have more fitness give their traits around and you have the discipline field of study of culture evolution that does that very concretely by just asking how culture evolves.
524922	532980	76	A	0.99471	So what cultural threats can get more fitness and be transmitted a very evolutionary centered approach to social change.
534070	545858	77	A	0.99936	So, to sum all of this up, basically we explain things by calling on to regularities always and we can talk about regularities in the phenomenology.
545874	569440	78	A	0.60744	So what the system does in of itself in the structure that is in the language system activity or in the function that is the constraint that exists over what the stem does and you have a specific brand of explanatory strategies that try to Legify behavior to make Nomological lawful explanation of human behavior and of sociocultural change.
570050	586980	79	A	1.0	And it's not immediately evident how they do that, how they think it's a coherent idea to begin with because well, humans learn culture change so what laws could they be in a field which is changing with time always?
587830	598150	80	A	0.99916	So in my opinion it is more a question of rhetorics than of epistemology because I do not think the answer is coherent.
598570	615930	81	A	1.0	The answer is, as far as I'm concerned that people they just Raify regularities that are observed in experimental settings often that are quite heavily fabricated as kind of cognitive laws of behavior.
616530	634078	82	A	1.0	And because those people usually agree in spirit to the mechanical kind of explanation they talk about cognitive mechanism or mental processes but only insofar that those mechanism or processes are explanatory of cognitive laws.
634094	638542	83	A	0.99988	They do not do the work of looking at the structure and function of the systems.
638606	653518	84	A	0.76164	They just claim there must be a mechanism that explain the vague law that I have observed over 20 people that came to my lab and these laws, they are assumed to scale for the explanation of social activity.
653714	661180	85	A	1.0	And so you have it, you have the recipe for universal law of social change.
662910	679710	86	A	1.0	And basically the whole argument stands on the idea that you have a presentation or mental processes or cognitive mechanism that somehow entail that the subject's behavior is regular through time and between individuals.
680450	691410	87	A	0.69	And you never have the work that would actually in any capacity prove it for reasons that we will not get into because it would get math heavy and renty.
691850	707530	88	A	0.99964	So if the rules and regularities of human behavior can change through learning, through culture, evolution, through whatnot, how can we exactly model or explain or even describe this agency?
709550	719374	89	A	0.99995	This is not dwell in anomaly callful framework because when we do natural laws, we look at regularities, we claim here is a law, this regularity is a law.
719412	724602	90	A	0.99998	So it explains that it exists and this is a circle.
724666	730270	91	A	0.99998	Because as far as I'm concerned, it's a circular reasoning.
730430	735070	92	A	0.99753	Like the regularities explain the regularities, which explain the regularities.
735150	737538	93	A	1.0	There is no way out of this.
737624	740420	94	A	0.5	You can recurse this all day long.
740790	743894	95	A	0.99	The only fact that you observe the thing is your explanation for the thing.
743932	747510	96	A	0.99963	This is not, hopefully, how we do Things in Science.
747850	752870	97	A	1.0	And you have a process of explanation that is more complete.
752940	760310	98	A	1.0	If you look at structure and function written lodge you can look at a specific system which has specific structure.
760390	766334	99	A	1.0	And you can look at what the system does, the function that the system enacts a specific point in time.
766452	773966	100	A	1.0	And you can look at how this function, this activity, shapes the system later on at T plus one.
773988	788034	101	A	1.0	You can have developmental approach to things that is centered on how system unfold how they learn, how they evolve through time that is doable there is no law against that and it could actually work.
788072	789860	102	A	0.9999	So yeah, let's do that.
790950	803480	103	A	0.6234	Let's explain natural phenomenon by describing how the underlying structure work but also by trying to explain how it's brought about how the system's activity explain the way it takes shape through time.
804750	830500	104	A	0.93749	So a claim that we will make here that is itself could be contentious but we don't have to look at why it is not relevant here is that active inference, which is a specific new trendy theory of human cognition can actually explain how regularities underlying social activity be constructed through time.
831510	835278	105	A	0.78	And let us look at what active inference says precisely.
835374	842942	106	A	0.95454	So we won't look at the math ever, we won't look here at the specifics of the theory.
843086	855290	107	A	0.85	The only thing we are going for is to prove that this theory indeed does what I think it does, which is explain or at least describe in a nontrivial way the evolution of social regulatories.
856030	868014	108	A	0.99785	So if active inference framework is true, then cognitive agents perceive the world through expectation they have developed about the world.
868132	870880	109	A	0.99998	So perception is an active process.
871650	880258	110	A	1.0	I do not perceive things with my eyes and compute higher and higher level of traits of what I saw.
880424	888850	111	A	1.0	I basically expect things in front of me and I will actively look at the things that are most likely to inform me.
889000	896930	112	A	1.0	And something that is critical about this framework is that the prediction it also underlies action or policies.
897010	904282	113	A	0.97294	So let's say trajectory of action that I enact, I will do the action that I believe I am more likely to do.
904416	909382	114	A	1.0	I will do that in virtue of me believing I am more likely to do this action.
909526	910410	115	A	0.57107	Whoops.
911310	939486	116	A	0.99887	So in that framework, active inference is understood as a process of enaction of a specific model that is causally shaped both by an agent's dynamics and an environment Cliodynamics and this relation well, brings a model that corresponds in abstract way to the structure of the dynamics of the relation.
939598	949282	117	A	0.65	And this model I can also look at it in a way more concrete sense in that it is what's in the lies what drives the agent dynamic?
949346	959110	118	A	1.0	You have a duality between the Cliodynamics and the epistemic mental states that we put, that we project, that we can observe in the dynamic.
959610	969870	119	A	0.99679	So a very important aspect of this is that world's entirely agency, as we would understand the term.
970210	983940	120	A	0.99999	There is no distinct step of perception which informs the agent on what the world is like and based on which the agents decide freely what action it will take.
984310	992818	121	A	0.99995	There is a constant prediction of what is going to happen and this is enacted by the agent both through perception and action.
992994	997110	122	A	0.99981	So what drives decision here?
997180	1009290	123	A	0.99851	What drives generally the flow that analyze the agent behavior is the agent self model and that has interesting consequences.
1009950	1012006	124	A	0.9997	So I have notifications.
1012038	1021670	125	A	0.59069	So we'll cut them sorry, what?
1021840	1022714	126	A	0.99982	Let me drink.
1022762	1023386	127	A	0.91	I will drink.
1023418	1030478	128	A	0.88	I need to drink it.
1030564	1044338	129	A	0.9971	So one consequence of this feminism is that normativity so the values and norms it's hard to go around that word that drive behavior.
1044434	1050630	130	A	0.99967	They are not in the brain, they are not something that the agent abstractly relates to.
1050780	1058060	131	A	0.99988	They are Embedded in the very process in which the agent understands and gorges and navigates the world.
1059230	1065458	132	A	1.0	And this is very relevant for a human cultural evolution because well, we are cultural creatures.
1065654	1086210	133	A	0.93547	We learn expectation about each other both explicitly by looking at how people do things and then expecting them to do the same things again and implicitly through the very process by which we relate to other people like norms, like language.
1086870	1102990	134	A	1.0	And the way you look at this learning through be, it can be reduced essentially because of the properties of active inference to what people call regimes of attention.
1103170	1120990	135	A	0.87779	So the way I pay attention to things, the specific things I will look at in my process of understanding and navigating the world, the flow by which has been that is the same thing as a set of value and a set of expectations.
1122130	1136654	136	A	0.99892	So what is important here is that normativity and values and things like that, they are Embedded in my cognition in a much more basic way than conscious self reflection.
1136702	1140510	137	A	0.99657	Although of course conscious self enaction can inform that flow.
1140670	1145894	138	A	0.99999	It is Embedded in the shared expectation I have with other people.
1145932	1165820	139	A	1.0	And there is no warranty, no result that I can actually be reflexive about it because, well, the way I predict things, it's based on the statistical regulators that have seen in the world and because the way I pay attention, it's entailed by a predictive model of what is going on around me.
1167390	1172926	140	A	0.56385	I'm very constrained, very much constrained by the statistics I have of the thing I have seen around me.
1173108	1179470	141	A	0.9996	So regularities drive, how I pay attention, which drive implicit or explicit value and normativity.
1179810	1193270	142	A	1.0	And you can add dimical steps, you can add reflexivity, you can add, I don't know, accountability, you can add a lot of things, but you cannot remove the very basic way in which cultural values and cultural expectation are Embedded in perception.
1196650	1208038	143	A	0.96511	Yes, this is a repetition of what I said, the patterns in the flow of attention that are Embedded that I have developed through the very fact of engaging with a cultural niche.
1208214	1211142	144	A	0.69	And they constrain my actions towards specific outcome.
1211206	1226670	145	A	0.99999	They entail specific values, specific norms, and they entail, at least they constrain very heavily the intention that I'm even able to conceive to generate.
1227490	1237342	146	A	0.88716	So there is an equivalent way to see this, which is engagement with the cultural landscape.
1237486	1243640	147	A	0.99991	So every agent, they experience the world not in the same way, of course, but they experience the same.
1244650	1254490	148	A	0.55879	Let us say that each person's experience of the world, it predicts very strongly the experience of the world that other people will develop around them.
1254640	1264380	149	A	0.98961	So there are structural properties of the landscape, of opportunities and perception and possible action that we experience.
1264830	1268346	150	A	0.97396	There are properties that are transferred between individuals robustly.
1268458	1270750	151	A	0.99999	This is the case, for example, of norms.
1272610	1279038	152	A	0.99999	If I look at a law, any specific law, all of the people in the same country, they are subject to the same law.
1279124	1281454	153	A	0.99998	So maybe some of them can just ignore it.
1281492	1282914	154	A	0.99999	They live too far from the city.
1282952	1284098	155	A	0.90997	We don't have cops here.
1284184	1287086	156	A	0.99998	Maybe some of them are above the law in some capacity.
1287118	1287950	157	A	0.92335	It's their relation.
1288030	1292726	158	A	0.67465	But the basic constraints that the law entail, it is experienced by everyone in a different way.
1292748	1297238	159	A	0.99557	We will all expect that specific people will react to specific situation in specific way.
1297324	1300760	160	A	0.87	And this is a real property of the landscape that we experience.
1301290	1311494	161	A	0.9984	So the way that this landscape shapes exploitation in a robust way, we can look at basically it as a constraint.
1311542	1324400	162	A	0.99998	So not as a derivative property of a landscape that I can or cannot experience, but just as a statistical force that shapes behavior in a specific way.
1325010	1344598	163	A	1.0	And looking at things like that, it means that I can see a given sociocultural field in two complementary way as a set of agents that navigate common well, not quite common, but mutually constrained social, cultural worlds or as a set of constraints that produce itself.
1344764	1356220	164	A	0.71	And the way agents reconstruct the world around them in their mind, the way they understand it in a creative manner, it is equivalent to the way the set of constraints reconstruct itself.
1356670	1380260	165	A	0.99998	Which is important because if I can look at this whole world as a set of constraints over statistical constraints or behavior that reproduce itself, I can look at it as a living thing, strictly speaking, because this is how we define living things, at least in specific sub branch of system biology that I believe is relevant is to be believed about that.
1380790	1389614	166	A	0.99947	So when we talk about structural landscape, we can look at them either as a landscape of affordances.
1389662	1403474	167	A	0.99998	This is opportunity for action that are experienced and enacted by a set of individual agents which interact so as to having some level of coherence between the landscapes they experience and enact.
1403602	1422526	168	A	1.0	And I can look at the same landscape as a system of constraints that are exerted over the behavior of this agent and that I can define and study with no clear reference to any individual agent in the same way that I can study a dog without looking at every single individual cell.
1422628	1430354	169	A	0.78859	What you're interested in, biology or sociology is usually aggregated patterns, not what every single living thing around thinks of.
1430392	1431540	170	A	0.99993	Every single thing.
1432790	1438820	171	A	0.99926	So that was the heaviest it got probably over the whole course.
1441130	1451090	172	A	0.88	I do not expect you to grasp all of the consequences of what I said because it was very condensed and it was very abstract.
1451250	1456970	173	A	0.99981	But the case I'm making here is not that everyone has to understand all the math right now.
1457040	1465050	174	A	0.99972	It is that this framework, it has things to say about relevant question in social science.
1465550	1471514	175	A	1.0	And to make this point, I will not just give the abstract presentation of how it's awesome because we have landscape.
1471562	1494290	176	A	0.98377	Whatnot I will look at specific fields, questions, case studies in social sense and I will look at basically how Oxygen France entails a pretty specific model of that that is well grounded in committee sense and that is relevant and that is adequate to the study of living, changing systems, et cetera, et cetera.
1495030	1498950	177	A	0.99254	So first agenda setting.
1499690	1503480	178	A	0.99999	Some of you will know what it is, some of you will not know what it is.
1504330	1510934	179	A	0.96088	So Azure setting is something that is situated in the work on public opinion.
1511062	1516250	180	A	0.94524	Specifically, I believe this book is called Public Opinion.
1518110	1519734	181	A	0.98328	So ajana setting.
1519782	1531434	182	A	0.93167	It refers historically, although you have a more diverse way to understand it now to the role of mass media like journals and later TV in manufacturing Consent.
1531482	1539666	183	A	0.99991	This is a textualization from the text of no, I thought I had the book cover, I forgot the name of the guy.
1539688	1541322	184	A	0.99988	I'm sorry you have to look at the reference.
1541486	1555130	185	A	0.99998	But it is used to study how mass media can manufacture consent by drawing attention to specific issues and shaping specific expectation about the world.
1555280	1569530	186	A	0.99993	So the idea is that you have a role, an active role of the elite, what I call the elite here, people which have active inference of the flow of policy or society.
1569690	1571034	187	A	0.99	I will call them elite.
1571162	1576030	188	A	1.0	And so those people, they basically transmit norms, they transmit normative expectation.
1576530	1581890	189	A	0.85711	So consent to whatever is the thing that they do, they want you to do more specifically.
1582310	1585474	190	A	0.99	And they do so not by telling you do this and that.
1585592	1588030	191	A	0.99916	They do so by building agendas.
1588110	1591800	192	A	0.95043	So drawing attention to specific issues in specific way.
1592490	1598374	193	A	0.99	And you can see here people who are I mean, it's prevalent in political life.
1598412	1599414	194	A	0.9838	Everyone knows that.
1599532	1601702	195	A	0.93443	But the US.
1601836	1605882	196	A	0.99924	Right wing is very transparent in doing that.
1606016	1624640	197	A	0.99	And so this is a meeting between two experts in a general setting, donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, which basically have convinced people that they should not worry about things like, I don't know, the price of life, whether we wage war here and there.
1625730	1627898	198	A	0.99991	Why do we have to pay millions?
1627994	1628594	199	A	0.99958	Why do us?
1628632	1638770	200	A	0.99994	People have to pay millions to get health care, but to how LGBTQ Democratic people threaten the US.
1638840	1640642	201	A	0.9999	Life in a very abstract way?
1640696	1653590	202	A	0.83361	Like, I did not ever hear any consistent, coherent, believable mechanism by which they explained how LGBTQ threatens whatever Republicans.
1654250	1656662	203	A	0.99971	But they do draw attention to this topic.
1656806	1661462	204	A	0.9998	They do share the expectation that Democrats and GBTQ are predators.
1661606	1680500	205	A	1.0	And they do so in a way that is able to legitimize themselves as become other people, to mobilize people to actually be behind them and do their bidding and to canalize political life in a way that is convenient for them because it keeps them in power.
1681430	1695170	206	A	1.0	And the role of attention, the way you pay attention to things in shaping behavior, it's just a redo of what I explained in active inference.
1695330	1703346	207	A	0.99983	If you believe that the forces, the way we constrain attention is explicit of behavior, then you believe in active inference just expressed differently.
1703458	1713894	208	A	0.9957	So this is a case where you have a classical, let us say, concept in a circle sense that essentially reduces to concepts of active inference.
1714022	1725562	209	A	0.63411	It's not to say, of course, that astrology is irrelevant and we should just do cognitive sense, but this is pretty rare to have such a direct response between topics that are disciplinary this far apart.
1725626	1728880	210	A	0.99992	So this is something we should definitely pay attention to.
1729910	1732850	211	A	0.97811	So, second case study nationalism.
1733910	1751558	212	A	0.99493	Basically, this case study is entailed by what I said over the Republicans because the move by which they legitimize their rule, it is just say we share an identity here, us, conservative, traditional values, et cetera, et cetera.
1751644	1754182	213	A	0.99	And this identity, it entails specific norms.
1754246	1765174	214	A	0.99	And for reasons that we are usually left out of the frame, I so elite people run DeSantis, Trump, Napoleon, whoever.
1765302	1769110	215	A	1.0	I get to tell you what this entity entails in terms of behavior.
1769270	1779490	216	A	1.0	You don't get to speak, really, because you are not someone who has newspapers that parrot what I say, what you say, because you have to keep constant with this subject.
1780150	1784580	217	A	1.0	And this is very consistent with the Cliodynamics by which we constructed nation states.
1785190	1802374	218	A	0.98314	So for the historical context, the idea that we have ethnicities and this is somehow relevant, normatively, like the Slav should organize together or the, I don't know, Hungarian should organize together, and we should get to agree to things that we do and then do them.
1802412	1803510	219	A	0.95727	It's very recent.
1805150	1806470	220	A	0.91496	It's extremely recent.
1806550	1807290	221	A	0.97063	Dates?
1807950	1836530	222	A	0.99989	Well, I won't get into the specifics, but let us say in this specific formulation, it dates from the 19th century, when you add a bunch of very powerful bureaucratic administration that took hold respectively, of France, united Kingdom, Prussia and they had the capability to rule most of the social activity, but they did not have any clear argument why people should listen to them in any capacity.
1837270	1862650	223	A	1.0	And the way it worked is that those administration they basically started claiming that they were somehow representative of a given ethnical and linguistic community and that in virtue of being part of this community you should listen to them and pay them respect and actively work for their goal to be fulfilled.
1863390	1875854	224	A	0.99	And of course it is not that easy to make this claim but what happened is they invested a huge deal of energy and organization into actually having people buy that.
1875892	1888530	225	A	0.9999	They built schools, they built prison, they built psychiatric hospital, they built a lot of infrastructure that enabled them to transmit norms in a very robust way and transmit identity in a very robust way.
1888600	1902322	226	A	1.0	And in doing that they managed to embed most of the micro social relation you could have into their specific ethnicity and into the normative power they lend to this ethnicity.
1902466	1914202	227	A	0.99538	So at some point, you know, I always forget farmer in a lost village in France you only meet at tax time.
1914256	1920922	228	A	0.99375	So main arm come and tell you give your grain and you give your grain because else you're dead.
1921066	1926826	229	A	1.0	And at some point, those people send you a teacher and they send you newspaper, and they claim, hey, you are French.
1926858	1927962	230	A	1.0	You have to speak French.
1928026	1929166	231	A	1.0	You have to be friends with us.
1929188	1930718	232	A	0.83	You have to fight our wars.
1930894	1937726	233	A	1.0	And because there is so much energy that is pending that people actually bite or die.
1937758	1954754	234	A	0.99948	That is another option because the other side of the coin is that states that legitimize themselves through nationhoods they have basically to be all the time invested in ethnic cleansing.
1954802	1961338	235	A	0.57205	Because people who are not the right ethnicity they are not considered element of these states.
1961504	1965802	236	A	0.99915	So they have to be submitted or removed which is a bad thing to do.
1965856	1968090	237	A	0.99806	This is a very bad thing to do ethnic cleansing.
1968770	1984302	238	A	0.72	And I'd like to illustrate this whole notion of identity capture through the African Renaissance monument that Abdullah Wade So, the president of Senegal had constructed in the capital.
1984446	1985890	239	A	0.99361	So it's very glorious.
1986230	2010506	240	A	0.99133	It is very good example of identity because it shows you the norms, it shows your glorious image of the African man and it shows how you have to be supportive of children, show them, protect them with your big muscle and give them very wild ambition, while African women look at you like they were non agents.
2010608	2011754	241	A	0.99962	Let us say that.
2011872	2015930	242	A	0.99305	So it gives a blueprint around which society should be organized.
2016290	2022174	243	A	0.64217	It gives you very specific picture of who this is speaking to.
2022212	2027594	244	A	0.99998	In this case Africans because I guess Senegal gets to say what is good for Africa.
2027642	2033954	245	A	0.53879	That is coherent claim to make I mean sarcastic, sorry.
2034152	2045766	246	A	0.99	And why I like this specific monument well, you have a lot lot well, first, it's very expressive, the Ardotrion in France it serves the basic same function but it does not show you.
2045788	2052486	247	A	0.99363	It tells you and the African society shows you what it means in a very well obvious way.
2052588	2059050	248	A	0.99	And the second main reason is this you have nothing around it.
2059120	2067766	249	A	0.72401	They just put it in a pile of dirt and they invested nothing in the infrastructure because they were too busy taking money for themselves, I guess.
2067888	2081546	250	A	1.0	I don't know exactly what did with tax money but clearly it was more invested in the symbolism of what African men should do and why they should follow him specifically and not in concrete infrastructure.
2081738	2087934	251	A	0.95	And in most cases energy capture is very rodeal for people who are captured.
2087982	2102680	252	A	0.99997	This is why I call that capture because what you get out of energy capture is a symbolic sense of being part of the good team and what you have to give is usually the entirety of the work you do over your life.
2103630	2117360	253	A	0.99757	It gets given to the state or administration that wants you to do things and do things for them and sometimes they build infrastructure but if they don't want to, they will not.
2117890	2125374	254	A	0.99575	That is very much a bad deal and I gave it away.
2125412	2129310	255	A	0.99247	So national identity, it was diffused to school and mass media.
2129380	2132574	256	A	0.99988	It was Embedded in a micro network of solidarity.
2132622	2146694	257	A	0.99652	So typically, the African resource Monument, it basically tells you that as a husband and father, you have to give in whatever the state ideology of Wad was.
2146812	2150840	258	A	0.53	And then it is leveraged for mobilization and legitimation and control.
2152730	2160486	259	A	0.97	And you have another I did not say why it was relevant to active inference.
2160518	2165338	260	A	0.9998	Well, it is relevant to Enactive inference because all of this is mediated by self model.
2165504	2172000	261	A	0.99994	All of this is enabled because people have self model and they enact the self model.
2172610	2182994	262	A	0.99	And there is no necessity of a reflexive step where you actually think about what is your self model and you are expected to do a thing.
2183032	2186322	263	A	1.0	You do the thing because you expect yourself to be doing the thing.
2186376	2190114	264	A	0.49	And active in France, as we said, you do what you expect to do.
2190312	2209674	265	A	0.99526	So this basically explains why such symbolic raw power it has actual consequences while if you have more rational model of humanity the question is why you build big things and not infrastructure it will be a rational response but this is not what people do.
2209712	2215770	266	A	0.99997	People follow norms and this is a way to broadcast norms very efficiently and robustly.
2216610	2236162	267	A	0.99247	So due to that I'd like to talk about structure and agency so there is a constant question in a social sense, usually social sense talk about structure so norms habitus way that institution builds through life and there is a legitimate question that is.
2236216	2243614	268	A	0.99996	Asked which is if you believe structure to human behavior, what is the place for agency?
2243662	2254166	269	A	0.99891	So there are constant debates in every subfield possible of social sense regarding what is actually explained by this structure and what is left to individual agency.
2254278	2260234	270	A	1.0	And what I want to say is that this question is essentially dissolved by the model of agency we have.
2260432	2268000	271	A	0.97048	So as we said, agency it's exerted through expectation over myself.
2268530	2288322	272	A	0.99785	So because social structure it becomes expected, it is enacted through the agency of these specific people that are within it not have an opposition between how strong the institutions are and how agentive people are because strong institution are institution that basically become Embedded in your self model.
2288456	2298274	273	A	1.0	And so there are people freely not freely, it's a bad term but from their own accord they enact those institution.
2298402	2302550	274	A	1.0	And this is the whole thing about anticapture, which I presented.
2303150	2320550	275	A	0.30307	Nationalistic ideology is strong, is efficient in building actual mobilization because it makes you believe that you will actually, if you want a court, follow the social order it gives, which was not unprecedented, but pretty rare in a premodern institution.
2320710	2324826	276	A	0.99998	Usually promoter institution are I am the king.
2324858	2325674	277	A	0.65	I have an army.
2325722	2326640	278	A	0.99998	Give me food.
2327170	2336094	279	A	1.0	And when you have legitimation attempts to actually explain why I should get the food these are pretty much justification.
2336222	2355514	280	A	0.99963	This is the elite people talking to themselves about why they are justified knowing that but you have no arguments and that would be actually compelling so as to why you would have to give the food and you have no attempt whatsoever to convince people who have to give the food they should give the food.
2355632	2366460	281	A	0.98795	This ideology they do not talk to the people they ask things from, they talk to themselves about why they can't they are legitimate to take the things.
2366990	2373434	282	A	0.99	And so yeah, in those case you have a pretty visible conflicting between structure and agency.
2373562	2379070	283	A	0.99999	Do I do what I'm told to do under a threat of death or do I do any other thing?
2379140	2381754	284	A	1.0	Of course most people would like to do other things but they can't.
2381802	2383678	285	A	1.0	And I will feel that they can't.
2383854	2398130	286	A	0.99488	But if you accept that agency is built through normativity, through engagement with a sociocultural field of finances, of productive action, you have to admit that software exists at least in part through agency.
2398290	2406250	287	A	0.99999	Because what agent believe is legitimate, what agents believe is right, what agent believe is expected.
2406670	2421214	288	A	0.99895	It is very precisely what constitutes structures and that is insight that is at least in part left out of the conversation in some field.
2421252	2431250	289	A	0.71	And I'd like to show why the direct conflict between certain agencies it does not have a strong bonding.
2432710	2448610	290	A	0.99513	Yes, again, I have said the thing that the slide would say there is another thing that is maybe closer to my core body of work which is how active inference afford indirectly an archaeology of cognitive landscape.
2448770	2468398	291	A	0.878	So if socialization is made of constraint over behavior and those constraints are to some extent Embedded in the natural environment of the people, then we can to some extent study archaeological landscape for themselves.
2468484	2480510	292	A	0.99995	We can look at landscape like material landscape, the object of study of archaeology, and we can make some inference over the constraints that this landscape entails over collective behavior.
2481490	2488658	293	A	1.0	I will not get into detail as well as to why, because it's far call.
2488744	2491886	294	A	0.99999	Making this inference is difficult, but very concretely.
2491918	2494974	295	A	0.99999	We can ask whether you're a key.
2495032	2507142	296	A	0.96745	So the idea that some people get to say to other people what to do and certification, the idea that some people are by nature above other people, they can be Embedded in vertical patterning.
2507206	2512540	297	A	0.99795	So you have a claim by people who fund me escape project, look it up, it's nice.
2513470	2526826	298	A	1.0	You have a claim that to some extent the rectification of society around the Iron Age, it is written, it is Embedded in vertical patterns in material culture and architecture.
2527018	2532606	299	A	0.79	And maybe I will not buy the claim outright, but it is very compelling.
2532638	2535246	300	A	0.99962	If you look at specific architecture, you get a specific feeling.
2535358	2539490	301	A	0.99573	So this is the not cathedral, but maybe Basilica of Frequency.
2539910	2545526	302	A	1.0	I will not try to say the name because I do not speak Icelandic, and that would be bad.
2545708	2550130	303	A	0.99481	But you have very progressive, compelling curve toward the sky.
2550210	2558566	304	A	1.0	You have specific feelings that are, how do you say, produced by this architecture.
2558758	2566780	305	A	0.99	And you have a very specific way in which it drives attention from something wide on the ground to something that goes up.
2567150	2584610	306	A	0.9	And if I did not make it clear yet, if we buy active inference, we buy that the patterning of attention, the way you give attention to things, it carries norms, it carries intentionality and in first person by introspection.
2584950	2594710	307	A	1.0	I think all of you can very clearly see how architecture drives specific patterns of attention and how those patterns specific elicit specific feelings.
2595530	2601078	308	A	0.98	And we currently do not have models that would be very specific and very Enactive of how this work.
2601164	2604810	309	A	0.99832	But we could this is huge work, but this is doable work.
2604880	2606646	310	A	0.99949	This is not speculations.
2606838	2611980	311	A	1.0	And I do not know of another commonism than active in France that would actually make it possible.
2613790	2627200	312	A	1.0	And last, I'd like to talk about the favorite thing in social sense, I guess, which is thing like a state, scots anthropology of states.
2627570	2635202	313	A	0.99781	So the core argument of Scott's, I'd say it's hard to identify a core argument in that book.
2635256	2641690	314	A	0.95991	But you have ways in which states so here equivalent to administrations.
2641790	2642726	315	A	0.5231	They understand the world.
2642748	2654646	316	A	0.50649	They understand the world through written forms that they can pass around many people, many institution to have actually a coherent model of the world that is pretty much abuse.
2654758	2659882	317	A	1.0	And what should be abuse but is not is that those models are reductive in the sense any model are.
2660016	2667280	318	A	0.99998	They emphasize specific information and they leave out other specific information.
2668690	2684606	319	A	1.0	And something that is very interesting, I'd say, is that states they tend to push specific models, specific landscaping, specific norms in urbanism, specific family norms that build legibility.
2684718	2688226	320	A	0.99488	So the ability to be understood by the state.
2688408	2697094	321	A	0.99906	So, for example, you could have very sparse settlements that are quite autonomous and that do that thing.
2697132	2698162	322	A	0.99992	It is a possibility.
2698306	2701590	323	A	1.0	There is no law or physical constraint around that.
2701740	2705702	324	A	0.99997	But it is far easier as a state to manage what is very close to it, right?
2705836	2713194	325	A	0.99998	So for a state, it's good to have a population that lives very close to the center of power because those people, they are just there.
2713232	2715658	326	A	1.0	You can go tell them what to do, it's simple.
2715824	2717774	327	A	1.0	And you can go ask them things.
2717812	2718446	328	A	0.9894	It's simple too.
2718468	2720560	329	A	0.99997	It's very easy to manage that.
2721330	2725150	330	A	1.0	And those people, they would need food to stay there.
2725300	2735970	331	A	0.99692	So we need some kind of food production model that is easy to take from and that is easy to organize and goge as a centralized institution.
2736390	2740306	332	A	0.53	And this is monoculture, this is agriculture as we understand it currently.
2740408	2744834	333	A	0.99938	This is people that make big field, that make the same crop always cereals.
2744962	2762902	334	A	0.99992	Well, not always, sometimes potatoes, but mostly cereals, because cereals, you know, it's very dense, energetically, it is easy to keep, it is easy to transport because it is dense and it stay edible long after recall.
2762966	2765126	335	A	0.89	You say recall in English cropping.
2765158	2772974	336	A	1.0	I don't know what is the word, but when you take the food from the plants and people have to stay there for very long to cultivate that.
2773012	2778794	337	A	0.99998	So they cannot go around and put potatoes here and there and leave when they don't.
2778922	2788260	338	A	0.87505	So you can just go to people and you know where the people are and where you can take the food and you know when the food is going to be.
2789030	2793354	339	A	0.99909	Again, I don't know the word cropped because it's cereals.
2793422	2794870	340	A	0.99992	It's always the same time.
2794940	2801970	341	A	0.73958	It's very visible in the landscape how far you are from recollecting cropping.
2802050	2804118	342	A	0.99998	So you cannot really have a way to cheat that.
2804204	2813450	343	A	1.0	You can just send many norms, take the food, give it to the city, to a different population, and you have a very rationalized controllable society.
2813790	2831090	344	A	0.82	And we do not know that this is the reason why we have cities and monoculture, but we do have traces that states very consistently tried to have big cities and monoculture field and mostly they succeeded.
2833910	2844998	345	A	0.85	And oh yeah, this is relevant to active inference because in active inference, the way you pay attention to things, it is productive of your world, it is productive of what cognition you have.
2845084	2856202	346	A	0.52	And here the capacity for administration, the capacity for written symbols that tell what things are, they are critical to a state's understanding of the world.
2856256	2862234	347	A	0.95402	They are what literally produces the way states pay attention to things.
2862432	2884260	348	A	1.0	And the fact it was basically major thing for them to have a world that looks like this it is very directly telling about the fact it creates a world, it's a direct instantiation of that and that is a nice link to do and I'm happy I did this link.
2885350	2891982	349	A	0.99965	So this is for the case studies expectedly.
2892126	2902566	350	A	1.0	You don't see the corrections, not all of them maybe you're convinced that there is something there but most likely you don't see very precisely what is to be seen here.
2902748	2908486	351	A	0.99847	So the expectation is that over the course, you develop a very specific understanding of active inference.
2908518	2925440	352	A	0.78	The framework you develop a specific understanding of how it relates to social science, to questions that are relevant in social science, and you develop the capacity to have an informal opinion on that critical informal opinion on how this relates to question in circle sense.
2926290	2930638	353	A	0.99915	So we are doing the introduction lecture.
2930734	2935700	354	A	0.99963	Hopefully I've convinced you there is something to see here if not too bad.
2936710	2940834	355	A	0.76	And the next session will be in four days, not one week, four days.
2940952	2954780	356	A	0.99608	It will be about basically the basics of active inference, what you have to know to understand, not the framework per se because it's math heavy, but what the framework says about our life as cognitive agent.
2955310	2957130	357	A	0.99996	So then you have the discussion.
2958910	2961254	358	A	1.0	You should know that for each lecture there is discussion.
2961302	2964362	359	A	0.88973	Lecture is vertical, people talk, you listen.
2964496	2966540	360	A	0.99985	Discussion is more free form.
2967010	2978014	361	A	0.99999	Every person has basically authority on how they share the discussion but the expectation is that it is a discussion because it's the name we gave to the thing.
2978212	2982206	362	A	0.73248	So after the basics we look at patterns of collective behavior.
2982318	3001314	363	A	0.99995	So how those elements on cognition, human cognition or non human cognition, they give tools to study the organization of collective systems like ant colonies or societies but we'll stay in not specific to human approach.
3001362	3011190	364	A	0.81014	We'll be interested in collective behavior but will not be interested in the specific patterns of collective behavior as afforded by human cognition.
3011350	3031470	365	A	0.54	Then we'll look at semiotics and semantics, the evolution of symbols so things that are closer to humans, we'll look at how Enactive inference accounts for evolution of symbol and what evolution of symbol affords for cognition and then from here we'll look at very social sensey things norm, script, narrative language.
3031630	3036638	366	A	0.68298	So how this discussion on active inference and collective behavior and semiotics?
3036734	3038206	367	A	0.99946	They inform very directly.
3038238	3045426	368	A	0.99763	They give a model specific principled, predictive model of social human behavior.
3045538	3059146	369	A	1.0	And then we'll look at so my thing, the way I like to think of it all, which is social constraints and we'll go back to the claim that there are landscapes of social, cultural cognition thingy thing.
3059248	3065974	370	A	1.0	And those landscapes can be looked at in abstracted from the individual scale manner.
3066102	3069242	371	A	1.0	And this is explanatory of cultural change.
3069376	3071962	372	A	1.0	And then we go for the conclusion.
3072026	3074590	373	A	0.9968	So we'll be interested in your opinion of the course.
3074660	3080740	374	A	0.99999	This is the first run we'd like to have feedback, a lot of feedback on what you thought of it and what would make it good.
3082950	3086210	375	A	0.99997	So that will be for the conclusion discussion.
3087510	3091060	376	A	0.64186	So here I hoped that you'd present yourself.
3092650	3099160	377	A	1.0	We have not the capacity right now to have students take the screen and talk.
3100090	3108060	378	A	0.99995	But I'd like to know, you can say in the chat what is your background, what are your expectation for the course?
3108510	3115562	379	A	0.97527	Whatever you want to say about things, the world preferably being related somehow to the course.
3115616	3126270	380	A	0.99999	That would be nice, but yeah, please tell things to Usher.
3131110	3132674	381	A	0.58976	That concludes my talk.
3132792	3145330	382	A	0.66	I thought this slide made it clear we have last thing, maybe we considered making projects.
3145410	3151990	383	A	0.99966	So you making projects that we read and maybe how do you say grades.
3152650	3164250	384	A	0.9976	But I do not think that we are in capacity to give standardized normalized degree or attestation that has any value.
3164320	3166780	385	A	0.99997	So we decided not to do it.
3168590	3176126	386	A	0.8714	So asking you to do things, to do projects is a bit weird if we're not going to grade it and attest that you did it.
3176228	3184802	387	A	0.99998	But if you want to do it, if you want to write things and send them to us for review, this is very okay, you can do that.
3184936	3188180	388	A	0.5443	We're not formally invited to do that, but you can do it.
3188710	3206182	389	B	0.99982	Well, I'll just add a point on that and then meanwhile, if anybody wants to ask a question in the live chat, we did raise this topic of different qualifications and it's something that we've been working on and continue to work on in the Institute.
3206326	3213610	390	B	0.98532	So potentially in future versions, but absolutely in future offerings, we will have these kinds of courses.
3213950	3224670	391	B	0.99869	But as Avel mentioned, this is kind of a first run and so it's really exciting just to even start that conversation and see what people are looking for in terms of certification.
3225570	3229810	392	B	0.99966	All right, so let's go to some questions in the live chat and comments.
3231910	3233106	393	A	0.82	Oh yeah, go ahead.
3233288	3245270	394	A	1.0	I did not make the escalation clear, but because it is a first and because we are still shipping the course, it is so much more important that you actually tell us what you expect out of it.
3245340	3249750	395	A	0.99246	Like what you want or what you perceive will be here.
3249900	3253870	396	A	0.99986	Expect in the active inference sense, that is a bit perception, a bit action.
3253970	3255660	397	A	0.99996	Please tell us about that.
3256750	3257354	398	B	0.99953	Awesome.
3257472	3268142	399	B	0.99994	In fact, the only way to reduce one's uncertainty is through active engagement and one is literally applying active inference when they do actively engage in this epistemic way.
3268196	3271326	400	B	0.92079	So I hope that all comes through.
3271508	3276026	401	B	0.91551	All right, a first question from Sfumato in the chat.
3276218	3285346	402	B	0.99991	Does active inference provide us with predictive power, potentially focusing on human or social scale issues?
3285528	3286658	403	B	1.0	What does it look like?
3286744	3293750	404	B	1.0	Or where would you say active inference provides us with predictive power or unique explanations and predictions?
3295850	3300742	405	A	0.98324	So yes or no, depending on the granularity of your question.
3300796	3303910	406	A	0.99531	So what you look at Enactive inference and not Enactive inference.
3304270	3307238	407	A	0.96915	Active inference is a branch of predictive processing.
3307254	3316554	408	A	0.59173	So it's a family in cognition that consider that your perception of the world is based on prediction.
3316682	3320586	409	A	1.0	You have two specificity of active inference within predictive processing.
3320698	3328926	410	A	1.0	One specificity is that it says that action are predictive are based on prediction too.
3329028	3338420	411	A	1.0	The other is that it proposed basically a mathematical formalism in which to study that that grounds the claim but also constrained the mechanisms a little bit.
3339030	3344358	412	A	0.87479	Predictive processing as a family is predictive of many things.
3344444	3350950	413	A	0.9997	It's predictive of the fact that basically you think you see things, but you are not in capacity to perceive them right now.
3351020	3370526	414	A	0.94619	So I see bit of tissue, no fabric that is beyond my computer and I see the patterns in it but I know perfectly well that the cell that are actually that have the precision to see those patterns, they are looking at the screen now.
3370548	3376458	415	A	0.99998	So I cannot possibly know what the patterns are except if I expect it and this is what shaped my perception.
3376554	3387666	416	A	0.99994	So this is predicted by predictive processing and what is also predicted is that basically the information flow in the perception part of the brain it is heavily top down.
3387768	3404170	417	A	1.0	You have more bandwidth that goes from visual cortex to the retina than reciprocal which is simply not compatible with direct perception, passive perception kind of model.
3404320	3417194	418	A	0.96235	It is, however, compatible with the idea that we predict the content of retinal activity and when our enaction is wrong, then you have feedback, you have perception error propagation.
3417242	3422218	419	A	0.98823	So this is pure predictive processing, this is explained by predictive processing.
3422314	3430574	420	A	0.99268	This is contradictory actively with most conceivable variants of non predictive processing.
3430622	3445910	421	A	0.97096	So yeah, Enactive processing is Enactive and I'd say it's not up for debate as I know active in France it takes in addition the idea that the actions are based on prediction.
3446250	3455162	422	A	0.91	I do not know what work, empirical work existed to check whether this is specifically the case.
3455216	3458220	423	A	0.99982	Maybe Daniel, you know what has been done about this?
3460110	3462220	424	B	0.9994	Complete your answer and I'll give a thought.
3463630	3470222	425	A	0.55786	OK, so there are conceivable empirical settings that would check that out.
3470356	3474430	426	A	1.0	I do not know of them, so I will not claim that they exist or do not exist.
3475250	3491666	427	A	0.99999	What is important to me is the mathematical grounding because most model of cognition kind of assume that we have computational power that is implemented somehow, somewhere by meat.
3491858	3495560	428	A	0.98	And this is wrong.
3495930	3504230	429	A	0.99963	We cannot just suppose that the big properties that the brain have, they must exist somehow, somewhere, we have to actually explain it.
3504300	3510042	430	A	0.99	And this is what the mathematical formalism behind active inference energy principle does.
3510096	3530640	431	A	0.99973	It explains that we should expect chemical system to be predictive somehow and although it is not directly made in math, it is pretty easy to see why the brain should have a lot of power at doing that because of the very heavy tune power for the mecholatunment it has.
3533490	3541482	432	A	0.51064	But I would not if active inference is empirically distinct from other case of predictive processing.
3541646	3543160	433	A	1.0	I am not sure how.
3543850	3553186	434	A	1.0	I cannot think of an experiment or empirical observation that definitely discriminates between active inference and non active inference.
3553218	3554390	435	A	0.99781	Predictive processing.
3555130	3556810	436	A	0.64	I think it exists.
3557310	3558234	437	B	0.99999	Great, thank you.
3558272	3570282	438	B	0.99995	Well, in many ways, active inference is predictive processing with action under additional sophistication and richness, supported by the free energy principle.
3570426	3580718	439	B	0.99999	These are technical topics that we explore in other discussions as to whether Enactive inference gives us unique explanation or enaction capacity.
3580894	3587518	440	B	1.0	One could look to, for example, the linear regression or any other type of statistical framework.
3587694	3594710	441	B	0.63702	Linear regressions in and of themselves don't make predictions because you need a target to make a prediction about.
3594860	3607514	442	B	0.99999	However, given a linear regression model relating to health outcomes, for example, you might use that model to reduce your uncertainty, which is to say, have predictive power about that system of interest.
3607632	3618522	443	B	0.98	And so in that respect, active inference has been used to develop a host of unique explanations and predictions related to a variety of cognitive and behavioral phenomena.
3618666	3625482	444	B	0.99973	I'll just leave it at that, and I'll read some introductions and such in the chat.
3625626	3629582	445	B	0.85476	So Robin writes hi, my name is Robin.
3629646	3631166	446	B	0.89	I work in digital governance.
3631278	3632500	447	B	0.95257	Yeah, go ahead.
3634070	3656966	448	A	0.99921	What makes that I buy active inference as a mechanical model of human cognition is that you don't really get adaptive enaction without some variant of action being predicted, because the default picture would be that you have to planify a full action trajectory.
3657158	3665222	449	A	0.99987	But there is no compatible way this can be fast enough and robust enough and not costly enough to underlie adaptive action.
3665286	3668906	450	A	0.99975	So basically you'd say I have to grab a cup.
3669018	3674602	451	A	1.0	I would look at the cup, see the cup, planify movements, Enactive the movements.
3674746	3683726	452	A	0.94525	If something happens, if I was slightly wrong about the position of the cup, the algorithm is too heavy for me to adjust.
3683838	3689582	453	A	0.99989	So you not be able to navigate anything at limit information or that is changing.
3689646	3693730	454	A	1.0	And we are very good at navigating things at misinformation which are changing.
3693890	3711930	455	A	0.99979	So until there is another mechanical model that predicts attuned adaptive action, I will have to buy active inference as a model of human conditions, basically because the mass underlying is pretty solid, in my opinion.
3712350	3714202	456	B	0.99994	Yeah, it's always a great question.
3714256	3719466	457	B	0.44365	It's relative to what measurements need a comparator.
3719578	3730866	458	B	0.96	And so active inference with Enactive value relative to something unspecified doesn't really make sense, but we can evaluate it better or worse in a certain setting, and so it's important to compare it.
3730968	3733090	459	B	0.99547	So I'll just read a couple introductions.
3733990	3735982	460	B	0.73717	Robin wrote hi, my name is Robin.
3736046	3737390	461	B	1.0	I work in digital governance.
3737470	3742594	462	B	0.95899	I've been curious about applying active inference to the construction of governance for digital commons.
3742642	3754534	463	B	0.99978	Great kickoff Sfumato wrote hi, I've been studying fundamental physics and now I am doing Cliodynamics with a current interest in pragmatist philosophy.
3754662	3762460	464	B	0.94	I came to discover active inference and see how to apply it to cultural evolution ander says hello.
3762830	3795400	465	B	0.97771	Anthony writes bonjour anthony writes background poker player, father entrepreneur, very little knowledge on subject attend cognitive security in Davis working on project that active inference is very relevant to expect to learn and engage and Gina writes hi, I'm a biologist and neuroscientist that wants to understand the theory to do experiments with the Xscape team.
3796410	3796966	466	B	0.99315	Cool.
3797068	3811580	467	B	0.99272	Well, people can continue to add introductions or questions in the Chat ben if you want to ask or reflect on anything or I'm sure there's more things to talk about.
3814270	3817170	468	C	0.99757	Yeah, I thought that was a fantastic introduction.
3817350	3820302	469	C	0.99983	Some very interesting connections that I wasn't expecting there.
3820436	3829170	470	C	0.99997	Nice to see Manufacturing Consent making an appearance and a lot that I think I can hold on, let me turn on my camera.
3829830	3837326	471	C	0.99798	Yeah, certainly a lot that I want to pick up on and hopefully circle back around to in the session.
3837358	3838180	472	C	0.99992	That I'll be.
3840950	3841700	473	B	0.74643	Cool.
3842390	3842946	474	B	0.78881	Cool.
3843048	3851286	475	A	0.99987	By the way, what I wanted to say earlier, and I could check now, is that I believed that Manufacturing Consent was a Chomsky thing, but it is not.
3851308	3861542	476	A	0.99942	It is a Lipman thing, which is the guy that basically funded the very notion of public opinion in the 30s in the book called Public Opinion.
3861686	3863866	477	C	1.0	The book is co authored with Chomsky, though.
3863888	3866700	478	A	0.88128	No, Chomsky was not.
3867150	3868874	479	A	0.96509	He was maybe eight at the time.
3868912	3872220	480	A	0.99	I very much doubt he actually did a thing.
3872830	3874078	481	A	0.50291	I'm sure I have a copy of.
3874084	3875258	482	C	1.0	That book on my shelf and I'm.
3875274	3877134	483	A	0.99983	Pretty sure there are no copy of the book.
3877172	3879198	484	A	0.75766	Manufacturing Consent by Chomsky.
3879294	3891734	485	A	1.0	The expression Manufacturing Consent is from a 30s book Public Opinion by Walter Lickman that founded the whole public opinion thing, according to Wikipedia at least.
3891772	3901714	486	A	0.99	I did not looked for a specific book that would specifically maybe last Public Opinion because what do we mean by public opinion?
3901762	3902598	487	A	1.0	I don't know.
3902764	3906380	488	A	0.05567	Lordbond does not go clearly, but maybe something else goes, I don't know.
3907070	3908330	489	A	0.99971	It's created for that.
3908400	3910220	490	A	1.0	I can at least say it.
3910910	3917230	491	B	0.97153	That's kind of the interesting question about multiscale systems and emergence.
3917730	3932478	492	B	0.99996	If we enable or grant that brains can perceive or do things that a single neuron can't, but that they have a material relationship to one another, then is public opinion just like a pile of sand?
3932574	3937646	493	B	0.99997	It just represents the summation of the nest mates?
3937758	3950520	494	B	1.0	Or does public opinion represent a singular integrated unit in its own respect, one that might have to be sampled by investigating the material constituents but still being something different from that?
3952890	3956554	495	B	0.99598	I'll just go to a question in the chat or Aval, if you have a thought.
3956752	3960010	496	A	0.99522	Does a pile of sand have semantics?
3962030	3963340	497	A	0.98	I loved it.
3963950	3965900	498	B	0.99083	For an observer or for itself?
3966370	3967070	499	A	0.99956	Sorry?
3967220	3970640	500	B	0.36152	Does the pile of sand have semantics for an observer or for itself?
3972050	3972830	501	A	0.87147	Good question.
3972900	3974574	502	A	0.99791	For observer, I guess.
3974772	3976910	503	A	0.88475	Not really for itself.
3977060	3979330	504	A	0.98934	Clearly not really not.
3979480	3981390	505	A	0.9287	That is symmetry.
3981470	3995320	506	A	0.99987	But I can put together brain and public opinion, different coordination mechanisms, but still coordinated systems yeah, complex adaptive systems in an unfavorable sense.
3995930	4003270	507	B	0.99936	If the sand is piling up at the bottom of an hourglass, it certainly has semantics for an observer who knows about hourglasses.
4005390	4007178	508	B	0.99239	Michael says hello.
4007344	4008054	509	B	0.84933	Haptivist.
4008102	4010540	510	B	0.86616	Greetings, Michael and asks a question.
4011070	4018590	511	B	0.99998	Please further contrast the terms regimes of attention and sociocultural landscapes.
4022430	4025594	512	A	0.99927	Contrast as in explain what the terms are?
4025632	4027386	513	A	1.0	I guess, yeah.
4027488	4029260	514	B	0.99982	How are those terms similar or different?
4033470	4039630	515	A	0.83	I do not see basically, we active inference people.
4039780	4044142	516	A	1.0	I did not have the ID propose regimes of attention.
4044206	4053390	517	A	0.90676	So specific patterns in the way your attention flows as an explanatory mechanism.
4053470	4056926	518	A	0.99749	Let us say what underlies the experience of cognitive landscape.
4056958	4067618	519	A	0.53428	Cognitive landscape you understood whatever is the array of things that you as an agent experience as your world.
4067804	4076966	520	A	1.0	And then we active inference people also claim that the coordination between individuals in cultural agency.
4077078	4086174	521	A	0.68137	So the way we co construct synchronize regime of attention means that there is a coupling between the landscape that we experience.
4086372	4096450	522	A	0.99987	So landscape that are constrained in such a way I will call social cultural landscape because it's easier than saying cognitive landscape that are constrained by sociocultural processes.
4098310	4099902	523	A	0.99981	Is that satisfying?
4100046	4100802	524	B	0.80045	Yeah, it's great.
4100856	4103300	525	B	0.99999	I'll just give another view on that.
4103830	4120250	526	B	0.63	A sociocultural landscape is something like the ecological landscape or the actual basis materially of our system of interest, what we are studying in sociology.
4120750	4142160	527	B	1.0	And so it consists of inert objects as well as animate cognitive entities whereas regimes of attention refers to the dynamical patterns of attention which is to say relevance and salience for cognitive agents.
4142710	4172170	528	B	0.95	And so the socio cultural landscape, to use an example from Avel's presentation, might include the modified niche that includes a monument and then a given cognitive agent might, when they gaze upon that landscape in an encultured fashion, have a regime of attention such that their eyes are moved towards the point of a monument.
4172590	4180598	529	B	0.99998	But the regime of attention is modeled as a pattern of dynamics of a single cognitive agent.
4180784	4187150	530	B	0.69	And in Enactive inference we model attention as covert or internal action.
4189730	4191280	531	A	1.0	I want to add something.
4191810	4203860	532	A	1.0	I use possibly abuse vitaminscape because it has a very specific meaning connotation, which is a space that you can gaze at.
4204950	4208470	533	A	0.95	A landscape is a space that you can gaze at.
4208620	4226700	534	A	1.0	And if you go to a more mathematical notion of space you will basically find very closely the expectation or formal entailment that this space represent the set of possibilities accessible to a system.
4227950	4229820	535	A	0.99997	This is all there is to it.
4230190	4233566	536	A	1.0	And this is not what a cognitive landscape is.
4233588	4238030	537	A	0.97786	It's not the set of possibilities that abstractly an agent could experience.
4238100	4240442	538	A	0.99966	It is what an agent experiences.
4240506	4244320	539	A	0.75572	No what can gaze at know.
4246150	4250002	540	A	0.99943	So this is why the notion of a landscape is very heavily used.
4250136	4268790	541	A	0.99982	It does not have a clear mathematical meaning it should have because it has a very specific, well conceptual meaning that is critical to the understanding we have of cognition and that is not afforded by set theory.
4268870	4277420	542	A	0.98589	So most mathematics we would use the brand of mathematics we teach in school and that physicists use.
4277870	4280010	543	A	0.99811	Most physicists, not all physicists.
4280830	4293094	544	B	0.99594	Well, if we consider like Waddington's epigenetic landscape or if we consider the surface that variational free energy is optimized on as a landscape, it gives us a lot of really good intuitions.
4293162	4304238	545	B	0.99432	It gives us something to gaze upon as instrumental modelers, but it is not the same as the landscape of trees.
4304334	4316470	546	B	0.99995	Even though each one of those trees might be modeled by an observer as possessing an epigenetic landscape or a regime of attention or a free energy landscape.
4319870	4324780	547	B	0.9895	Well, if anyone has other thoughts or questions, we can consider them.
4325310	4326250	548	B	0.97071	Otherwise.
4328190	4330582	549	A	0.82207	Just give me a second.
4330736	4337450	550	A	1.0	I don't think everyone has do you see the image?
4337610	4340906	551	B	0.99974	Yeah, it's small, but Waddington's landscape.
4340938	4341326	552	B	0.9999	There you go.
4341348	4341694	553	B	0.99997	Thank you.
4341732	4343158	554	A	0.96854	Yeah, Waddington's landscape.
4343194	4346914	555	A	0.83504	So it is a very old thirty s.
4346952	4347426	556	A	0.93821	Twenty s?
4347448	4351490	557	A	0.92869	Thirty s, I guess thing in evolutionary biology.
4352150	4358706	558	A	0.97277	So Waddington is, let us say, the founder of contemporary developmental biology.
4358898	4365106	559	A	0.99	And the landscape are basically dynamical fitness.
4365298	4367138	560	A	1.0	I do not know how to not say landscape.
4367154	4368120	561	A	0.98267	That is a problem.
4368430	4373530	562	A	0.84758	They're basically the space in which agent can evolve.
4374190	4377610	563	A	1.0	The phenotype of the agent can evolve during its development.
4378110	4390654	564	A	1.0	And this is a very grounded visual metaphor, symbolism, I don't know for the study of developmental system.
4390772	4400290	565	A	0.99808	So this is why we told Cough landscape for the gazing and for this historical grounding of the developmental studies in biology.
4402150	4406258	566	A	1.0	And also I literally am paid to landscape archaeology.
4406354	4408498	567	A	0.97322	So yeah, let's overuse it on landscape.
4408514	4409720	568	A	0.99953	That is good for me.
4411290	4411702	569	B	0.99991	Cool.
4411756	4423130	570	B	0.99994	But it's an example of using our spatial and Embodied experience to get a grasp on different conceptual topics.
4423950	4426438	571	B	0.9944	Ben, you have any comments or I'd.
4426454	4429610	572	C	0.9972	Love to hear a little ask about this image.
4430030	4439434	573	C	0.81451	There's a couple of words that I was expecting to creep into this discussion that did not, which are attractors and repellers Avel when you mentioned dynamical systems.
4439482	4446302	574	C	1.0	I wonder if you think these are useful terms for thinking about because attraction goes very naturally with thinking about attention.
4446446	4457030	575	C	1.0	And I wonder if you think this is a useful kind of linguistic tool for visualizing the relationship between social cognitive landscapes and attention.
4462280	4465270	576	A	0.99996	Do you see the social constraints diagram now?
4465960	4470872	577	A	0.95	Okay, I wanted to have it if there is a screenshot laying around, I wanted this to be the screen share.
4471006	4473080	578	A	0.99896	So attractors and repellers.
4473500	4478148	579	A	0.7609	We're basically talking fitness when we're talking landscape, we're talking fitness landscapes.
4478244	4481560	580	A	0.99921	So I guess it kind of entails the notion of attractors and repellers.
4482060	4504108	581	A	0.55	Now, there are many reasons why I'd stay away from the Mikola system terminology because well, the Mikol system, they entail the preformulation of all possibilities of the system, which I think is very wrong to do for biological system and social system system that undergo open ended evolution and reconstruction.
4504284	4509110	582	A	0.99993	So I stay away from this formalism whenever possible.
4509720	4522216	583	A	0.53	And attractor technically mean subregions that you cannot possibly get out, which exists in conservative system, basically.
4522318	4528760	584	A	0.99991	But in all cases that we're interested about, it's technically not a tractor.
4529420	4534616	585	A	1.0	And we can't think of it as a tractor at a specific time scale.
4534648	4535372	586	A	0.99901	It's okay.
4535506	4541880	587	A	0.99998	But then if we have to abuse the formalism this much, why not not use the formalism?
4542040	4546536	588	A	0.99997	That would be my flow of reflection about this terminology.
4546728	4550832	589	C	0.87	I understand the tractors as states that have visited more regularly than others.
4550886	4553170	590	C	0.9781	So is there something about that that's not correct?
4553780	4556770	591	A	0.99	I will check it out.
4557140	4557504	592	A	0.99991	Yeah.
4557542	4569324	593	B	0.8246	An attracting set is one that is revisited, but there are of course many sub definitions to be more technical, like the attractor, is it just the point or is it the basin of attraction?
4569472	4581640	594	B	0.99988	But broadly on a landscape, as things shake out, the attractor begets some states that are revisited more than those that are not.
4581710	4585950	595	B	0.97384	That's kind of the tautological definition of the attracting set.
4589360	4599264	596	A	0.93977	An attractor is emphatically not at least under standard definition set of states that is visited more often.
4599462	4602700	597	A	0.9998	It is characterized by forward invariance.
4602780	4605104	598	A	0.60205	So the fact that once you're in, you don't get out.
4605222	4612244	599	A	0.99979	So an attractor is a manifold so subspace, let us say, such that if you rain, you get out.
4612362	4618100	600	A	0.9998	Well, there is a basin of attraction such that if you get in the basin, you get into the attractor.
4618920	4630376	601	A	0.99618	So if you look at stochastic chemical systems, maybe you will get out because a stochastic means with random noise basically.
4630478	4631496	602	A	0.99989	Let us say that.
4631598	4649870	603	A	0.99968	So if you are specifically within a stochastic chemical system, so nonical system per se, then you can talk of attractor and think of things that are not actually that do not have this forward invariance, just things that you tend to stay in for a while once you win.
4650180	4653552	604	A	0.99999	But you are not talking about attractor anymore, you are talking about some other thing.
4653606	4657872	605	A	0.98	The functional liberty is forward invariance, we don't have invariance here.
4657926	4659920	606	A	0.99997	So let's not talk of attractors.
4663960	4664276	607	B	0.99976	We.
4664298	4665844	608	C	0.9922	Shouldn'T fall down this rabbit hole completely.
4665882	4667510	609	C	0.99587	We can talk about this another time.
4668680	4670712	610	B	0.99995	Let me go to another great question.
4670766	4677080	611	B	0.99976	In the chat, Michael says a philosophical question.
4677230	4684190	612	B	0.71132	Science does a beautiful job of describing and building testable predictions of reality, but underweights subjective experience.
4684640	4692430	613	B	0.83686	Human subjectivity arises within experience of observation, but includes preconditioning as well as experience.
4692800	4701280	614	B	1.0	How should science informed observers reconcile the limits of subjective experience with the limits of objectification?
4704420	4706300	615	A	0.94287	Science build good models.
4706380	4708784	616	A	0.9998	Good models are competent engagement.
4708912	4710550	617	A	0.99968	That is basically it.
4711560	4719940	618	A	0.96381	So the question of how to build a sense that is effective to information is basically the question that funded Kairos.
4720700	4725736	619	A	0.81	I would not use the word effective per se, but that's pretty close.
4725918	4735000	620	A	1.0	And we'd have to in principle sense is built to create precise models.
4735080	4744060	621	A	0.99744	Precise as in does not create prediction error within a specific context that is heavily ritualistic and conservative.
4744820	4752610	622	A	0.94	And that would be, you could criticize pretty heavily the institution of science as a truth seeker normative thing.
4755540	4769708	623	A	0.78192	So you'd have to have a good level of reform to basically enforce modeling that are both robust and easy to transmit socially outside the caste of scientists.
4769824	4779610	624	A	0.96803	So Danielle and I and many other people wrote a paper on ontology for decentralized science which speaks to it.
4780540	4790968	625	A	0.79	And yeah, so if you get science, you get good models and once you have good models, you can navigate competently.
4791144	4813728	626	A	0.96876	But and I don't know but end both, you would need heavy level of reform institution of science to get this process be more ergonomic, efficient, compelling and socially influential.
4813904	4817812	627	A	0.98	And yeah, I think it's an important thing to do when I try to do it.
4817866	4819670	628	A	0.97685	So thank you for the question.
4820700	4823210	629	B	0.99983	I'll give another angle on that.
4824860	4838072	630	B	0.67957	Bayesian statistics qualitatively equates to the explicit provisioning of our priors and how we update those prior beliefs.
4838136	4844636	631	B	0.99999	As new observations come in, we may have high attention to new observations and update our beliefs a lot.
4844738	4852252	632	B	1.0	We may not be paying to the attention to the new stimuli and therefore continue our prior belief.
4852316	4858128	633	B	0.99996	So if we're not paying attention, it's kind of like a belief with inertia that's greater.
4858224	4884220	634	B	0.94	And if we are paying a lot of attention, then beliefs change more rapidly and trying to capture every single belief that leads to a research team, whether they're in academia or not, to carry out, interpret, analyze and communicate a certain topic that is a really far reaching task.
4884640	4902210	635	B	0.99999	However, Bayesian statistics and Bayesian approaches like active inference are helping us get a grasp at the preconditioning that does play an essential role with ongoing experience.
4902740	4914964	636	B	0.64204	So the question of how to engage with extant institutions and norms and practices is a challenging and ongoing work.
4915162	4933340	637	B	0.99999	But in some ways the formal principles that help us understand how context and measurement come together for cognitive entities and groups, those fundamental principles are being communicated.
4935040	4939390	638	B	0.99999	Maybe also I'd love to hear about what you're planning to talk about.
4941440	4946190	639	C	0.99987	Yeah, I'm not sure if I even fully understand the question.
4948420	4959620	640	C	1.0	The question just briefly I took it to be maybe some worry about the relationship between the formalisms and computational models in active inference and human subjectivity itself.
4959690	4963670	641	C	0.9999	So how do they bridge the gap of phenomenology there?
4965000	4966692	642	C	0.99933	It's a really interesting question.
4966746	4977000	643	C	1.0	I know that there are some people who think that phenomenology, human subjective experience is just going to have these transcendental aspects to it that can't be captured by the formalisms.
4977420	4980280	644	C	0.783	That's something I won't be talking about in my session.
4982000	4991390	645	C	0.99901	What I will be talking about is I'm going to speak on some things that did come up briefly today.
4991760	4999756	646	C	0.99993	So many of the readings that feature in my section are readings that will use the term predictive processing.
4999788	5016800	647	C	0.99969	So I was going to say a little bit quite briefly about how I think these different, slightly different frameworks fit together and what some of the similarities and differences are, I was going to say move quite quickly and superficially over some of the core mechanisms.
5016880	5020360	648	C	0.99981	So precision, weighting predictions, generative models.
5021660	5042350	649	C	1.0	And then what I'm going to try and do is, before we go on to the subsequent weeks where we look at collective behavior, normativity social scripts and things, I wanted to try and build up a nicely layered picture of what it's like to be an active inference agent in the world.
5042880	5048972	650	C	1.0	And so the way I'm going to do this is by swooping over some philosophical territory.
5049036	5059040	651	C	0.99918	So I'm going to look at the way active inference has said interesting things about philosophy of mind, particularly in terms of the role of internal representation.
5060280	5067156	652	C	0.99993	If I have time, I'm going to say a little bit about Embodied cognition, some of the four E stuff, aval, you got it right.
5067178	5070768	653	C	0.99973	So it's Embedded, Embodied, enacted, and Extended.
5070864	5080570	654	C	1.0	And I'm not going to be able to talk about all of those, but I'm going to say a little bit about some of them and how active inference kind of brings interest in debates in that area out.
5081020	5085816	655	C	0.99683	I'm going to say a little bit about folk psychology and motivated action.
5085928	5093980	656	C	0.99982	So talking briefly about what agency itself is for an active inference agent and.
5094050	5097600	657	A	0.99883	Whether psychology folk psychology.
5099940	5102300	658	C	0.77334	It'S a kind of propositional psychology.
5102380	5112096	659	C	0.99992	So it's a framework of propositions that we generally use to describe and explain human behavior.
5112288	5127588	660	C	0.998	So it involves propositions such as A, desires, B, or X hopes that Y, and it turns out that this propositional psychology is pretty good for explaining and predicting human behavior.
5127684	5134540	661	A	0.99982	But it's not you say we, it's scientists, laypersons philosophers.
5141520	5145420	662	C	0.9997	So do you mean we in the sense that it's a useful framework?
5146160	5151660	663	A	0.51	I mean that you should explain what the term is, because folk psychology is quite specific.
5151730	5154308	664	A	0.99977	It's not a word that is in folk psychology.
5154504	5155104	665	C	0.76	Okay, yeah.
5155142	5160610	666	C	0.99886	So folk psychology is just basically the linguistic framework we use to describe human.
5161700	5170464	667	C	0.51035	Say, you know, if I want to explain why Avel goes to the refrigerator to grab a beer, I would say you believe there's beer in the fridge.
5170512	5176200	668	C	1.0	You desire a beer, and then on the basis of that, you form the intention to then go to the fridge.
5176700	5187076	669	C	1.0	And it's been the subject of a lot of philosophical interest because the kind of ontological status of those concepts is very unclear.
5187108	5206130	670	C	0.99999	So it's not clear whether when we use folk psychological concepts, are we saying that those concepts exist in some meaningful way, or should we take a more pragmatic approach and say that this is just instrumentally useful, but we're not actually positing the existence of any kind of brain states or anything like that.
5206820	5212800	671	C	1.0	And there's been some interesting work on how predictive processing and active inference might map onto folk psychology.
5213640	5216272	672	C	0.99998	Are they in a necessary kind of tension?
5216336	5225380	673	C	0.99999	Because obviously with Enactive processing, you have just a very limited set of primitives with which to describe and explain human behavior.
5225900	5241080	674	C	0.99991	So I'm going to say a little bit about that and then I'm going to move straight into talking about phenomenology and talking about how certain aspects of the framework have been said to underpin certain kinds of experiences.
5241160	5247500	675	C	0.99992	So I'm going to use a case study of addiction, I think possibly depression, but I think I'm going to talk about addiction.
5247840	5259456	676	C	1.0	And with this case study, I'm hoping to bring out kind of tie together all of the things that I've said up to that point and some of the things that you've covered as well, and I should say as well.
5259478	5264324	677	C	0.99999	In the discussion session for my section, we'll have a special guest as well.
5264362	5273812	678	C	0.58182	So we're going to be joined by Professor Mark Miller, who is a prolific author of predictive processing and neurophenomenology type stuff.
5273866	5286090	679	C	0.9998	He's done some really interesting work on happiness and, wellbeing, depression, addiction, and really using the active inference framework in some quite imaginative ways.
5286700	5288580	680	C	1.0	And he's awesome in discussion.
5288660	5293820	681	C	0.99448	So hopefully you will find the readings for my section really interesting.
5293970	5299980	682	C	1.0	And if you do, you'll have a chance to kind of have a conversation with the author for those pieces.
5303270	5303950	683	A	0.44711	Avel.
5304030	5305650	684	B	0.99994	Any closing notes.
5308550	5310146	685	A	0.37337	Actual inference rules.
5310258	5311400	686	A	0.99	I will say.
5313530	5315126	687	B	1.0	One short question.
5315228	5317834	688	B	0.99	I just want to get it on there while we're here.
5317872	5326380	689	B	0.55435	Brynn asks, as a psychologist, I am more or less in the business of helping people minimize their variational free energy and expected free energy.
5326690	5327950	690	B	0.99998	Great profession.
5328290	5331994	691	B	0.99999	But what are the markers of free energy in the brain or organism?
5332122	5339498	692	B	0.99999	Is it heart rate, neuromodulation, galvanic skin response, cortisol levels, et cetera?
5339674	5346370	693	A	0.73	I say the closest proxy would be those prediction error things in the brain.
5347030	5360840	694	A	0.99612	So when we have expectation and they are violated, you have back preparation of this information, the fact the expectation was violated and this would be the closest proxy to variational free energy.
5362730	5368570	695	A	1.0	I do not think it would be the exclusive one, but it is the main one.
5368720	5371994	696	A	0.98	And I don't think you could make an exhaustive list.
5372032	5380638	697	A	0.99959	Basically anything that is out of order so as to prompt any kind of response of either updating models or facting on things.
5380724	5391054	698	A	0.99999	It would be a marker of prediction error, which is not quite variational free energy, but is also not quite not it.
5391252	5396842	699	A	0.55861	So for expected free energy, I have no idea whatsoever.
5396906	5402680	700	A	1.0	I don't think this framework has made connected explicitly to physiology yet.
5403530	5404870	701	A	0.96	Am I wrong, Daniel?
5406970	5419914	702	C	0.96029	It's a very interesting question, and all I will say, all I feel like I can say on it is one thing we're going to talk about in my session, is how prediction error is not always a bad thing.
5420032	5425770	703	C	0.99441	So there's a really nice Aon article that came out fairly recently about the value of uncertainty.
5426130	5444034	704	C	1.0	And one of the things I'm going to talk about is how predictive processing has perhaps it can account for phenomenon such as playful behavior, creativity, engagement in challenging hobbies and dangerous sports and things like this.
5444072	5458902	705	C	1.0	And how we get an account of exploratory behavior and curiosity, which is kind of rooted in the fact that for creatures like we are for active inference agents, the resolution of prediction error itself is a good thing.
5459036	5461574	706	C	1.0	And so in some sense, we're always seeking it out.
5461612	5473020	707	C	0.99942	So I think it might be a mistake to kind of it's very intuitive to equate prediction error of free energy with kind of allostatic load and stress and negativity, but actually it's going to turn out that that's not the case.
5474190	5474602	708	A	0.67502	Yeah.
5474656	5475498	709	A	0.99995	Thank you.
5475664	5480074	710	B	1.0	And I'll give another type of answer, which is variational.
5480122	5486378	711	B	1.0	Free energy and expected free energy are statistical calculations about statistical models.
5486474	5489886	712	B	0.99997	So bodies don't have expected free energies.
5490078	5495682	713	B	0.99986	Models that are made about bodies can have variational and expected free energy.
5495816	5505410	714	B	1.0	And so to that end, whatever you put in your model is either an observable or a proposed latent hidden state that you didn't measure.
5505570	5514466	715	B	1.0	And you may find that different experiential reports or different physiological phenomena have different relationships to each other.
5514508	5530414	716	B	0.99998	So indeed, it has been explored, for example, which neural firing rates are associated with surprise or which hormonal changes are associated with this or that change in body temperature when the generative model is made.
5530612	5540998	717	B	1.0	The deflationary answer is look at the data and find out which cues you measure are associated with your calculation of VFE and EFE.
5541194	5548100	718	B	1.0	However, I think it's a little bit of a map territory situation and one that's going to come up, I am sure, many times in our course.
5550310	5550770	719	B	0.99993	Great.
5550840	5562774	720	B	0.99808	Well, I'll just remind people to go to the course website to review the syllabus and also encourage everybody to submit questions through the course website.
5562892	5567174	721	B	0.99987	All of the teachers will review the questions and we'll give the best answers we can.
5567292	5573362	722	B	0.98	And also, please, from all backgrounds, we would love to hear your voice in the discussions.
5573506	5576442	723	B	0.95644	So thank you again, Ben and Avel.
5576626	5578400	724	B	0.99984	See you next week.
5580210	5580570	725	B	0.98371	Bye.
