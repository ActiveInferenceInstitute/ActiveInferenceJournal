1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,590
You.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,388
All right. Hello and welcome everyone.

3
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:12,760
It is July 7,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,420
2023, and we are in the first

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,300
introductory session of the course,

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,012
active Inference for the Social

7
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,764
Sciences. This is going to be a really

8
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:25,928
exciting course and journey that we're

9
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:28,036
all going to join and co create

10
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,944
together. With no further ado,

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,636
I will pass it to please mute turn off

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,590
the live stream Avil. Thank you.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,852
Complex systems and feedbacks with

14
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,412
cyberphysical systems will be a theme.

15
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:46,664
We told you it would be. I will pass now

16
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,364
to Avil for the introductory session.

17
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:51,352
If you're watching live, please feel

18
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:53,820
free to write any comments or questions

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,596
in the chat and I'll relay them at the

20
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:58,940
end onto the lecture. Thanks, Abel.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,390
Go for it.

22
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,634
So, hi, do you hear me? Well, there was

23
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:31,726
a sound issue. Okay, cool. So I'm

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,862
avoid I organized, I guess, the course.

25
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,366
I had the idea and worked on

26
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,614
the curriculum. Do you see

27
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,880
the slides? Well.

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,042
Looks good. And just make sure to close

29
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:49,834
the YouTube video or mute it. So, hi,

30
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:52,374
do you hear me? Well, that was Sunday.

31
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:55,578
Sure. Okay, cool. Okay. I did not know I

32
00:01:55,584 --> 00:02:00,686
had to do that. So this

33
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,326
is the introduction session of the

34
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:06,190
course. Very unsurprisingly. My name is

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,558
Kerriu. I am a funding member of Kairos

36
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:13,214
Research and I am a non funding member

37
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:15,794
of Active Inference Lab, which co

38
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:18,180
organize the course.

39
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,742
And first I will basically present the

40
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:25,730
teaching team. So we have Danielle,

41
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,470
which is with us, which is a PhD in

42
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,522
Ecology and Evolution, studying ants

43
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,494
behavior in an eco evo kind of way,

44
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,738
who is a president and co founder of the

45
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:39,914
Enactive Transitutes and who is

46
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,546
interested in, among the things art,

47
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,234
philosophy and cognitive security. Then

48
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:47,098
we have Ben, which is also here with us,

49
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,886
which is a second year PhD candidate in

50
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,530
Philosophy at the University of Sussex,

51
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,800
which, like me, interested four

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,830
E cognition, which is Embodied,

53
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,294
Enactive, Embedded and Extended

54
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:04,882
cognition. We don't need to get into

55
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:08,162
that now. He will explain to you. And in

56
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:11,138
Enactive Processing, which is basically

57
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,982
working on the cognitive science of

58
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:15,654
technology. And then we have people who

59
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:17,538
are not here today, which are mao

60
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,562
Albarasa, PhD candidate in the Cognitive

61
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:23,830
Computing at University Morielo,

62
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,234
which is head of Product Innovation and

63
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,450
Research at versus private sector

64
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,446
research lab in AI and the mathematics

65
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:36,262
of AI, which specializes in wildlife

66
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:38,394
inference. The theory we're working on

67
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,846
right now, script theory, which she will

68
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:43,486
Extended maybe I will talk a bit of it

69
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:45,246
today, but she will be the one who

70
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,470
explains what script theory is to you

71
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,690
and modern artificial intelligence.

72
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,606
And we have Lauren Gonzala, also a PhD

73
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:58,402
candidate, also in philosophy, but in

74
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:00,818
Wollongong, I believe this is how you

75
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,346
say it in Australia, which is centered

76
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:06,354
in philosophy of mind and in the status

77
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:08,466
of information processing, as the term

78
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,390
is used in cognitive science.

79
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,386
And then there is me. So I made a career

80
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,658
timeline because when I talk about what

81
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,426
I did, people get confused. I did

82
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,618
physics, math, I did engineering, I did

83
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:22,346
cognitive science. I did research in

84
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,694
ecology and evolution. I did a master's

85
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,594
in complex system physics, and I did,

86
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:29,806
like, one year, apparently, given my

87
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:32,222
timeline or two, no, more than more,

88
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:35,342
two of independent research as part of

89
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,006
kerose research and as part of the

90
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,106
French Society of Cliodynamics before I

91
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,540
started the PhD I'm doing now. Which is

92
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,562
something about the enaction between

93
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,306
mind and material culture. We will get

94
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,340
into that at some point.

95
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,120
And the question motivation I have are

96
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,482
essentially describing the relation

97
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:56,854
between phenomenology. So the way we

98
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:58,274
experience the world and physical

99
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,374
reality, which I have the fringe view

100
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,614
that somehow phenomenology is

101
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,586
constructive of physical reality, which

102
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,594
could have weak and strong

103
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,980
interpretation. I subscribe to both.

104
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,450
I'm trying maybe more importantly here

105
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,922
to explain or at least describe how

106
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,746
sociocultural life form, let us say the

107
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,382
regularities that in the life, social

108
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:21,530
life, human social life are constructed,

109
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,798
which is hard. And I'm trying to build a

110
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,038
research that is effective at doing

111
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:31,422
knowledge, not word piles through

112
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,882
our work in Kairos research. So these

113
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,394
are specific reference. You will get the

114
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:40,034
slides at some point I guess I will

115
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,166
publish them on the website and then we

116
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,686
will be able to check it out if this is

117
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:47,254
of interest to you. So let us get on

118
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,120
the actual relevant content.

119
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,962
So what we are going for here is

120
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:57,174
basically explain the very basic demarch

121
00:05:57,222 --> 00:06:00,982
of the course, explain how it's

122
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,386
of relevance, how the framework we

123
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:05,770
propose is of relevance to social

124
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,886
science and present a few case study to

125
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,894
make the case. And then we will talk

126
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,470
about course layout. But this is pretty

127
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,006
quick. So first I'd like

128
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,810
to talk about the explanation of

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,326
cultural dynamics. What does explaining

130
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,380
cultural dynamics even mean?

131
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,480
Depends who talks. There are many

132
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,442
types or views on what is scientific

133
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:38,454
explanation. I say we can cluster them

134
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:41,622
in three broad categories. One is

135
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:44,506
numerological, so it's about laws. And

136
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,970
what it does is to take regularities,

137
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,834
just say here is this regularity and

138
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,122
consider that these statements. So the

139
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:57,642
law has an explanatory capacity

140
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:00,478
toward the regularity. So for example,

141
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:03,520
for those of you who are familiar with

142
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,594
the work of, and I forget

143
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:08,350
names,

144
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,218
foundation, the foundation trilogy, I

145
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,362
believe it's trilogy. This is pretty

146
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,538
close to what they call psycho history.

147
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:22,934
So basically trying to find laws of

148
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,994
behavior and using them to predict

149
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:28,600
history in a regular lawful way,

150
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,842
then we have mechanical explanation

151
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,506
which are more typical of the life

152
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:37,238
science. And what we do in mechanical

153
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,286
explanation is to look at the structure

154
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,754
of a system and model the structure and

155
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,950
try to use this model to predict

156
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,654
specific regularities that are of

157
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:49,886
interest. And you have

158
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,670
approach to social sense that is I'd say

159
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,606
quite close to that which is

160
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:57,566
Cliodynamics, which waits a lot on the

161
00:07:57,588 --> 00:07:59,406
Nomological side but still is centered

162
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,282
on dynamics and mechanisms and

163
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:04,510
explanation by calling onto

164
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,586
structure in specific societies. And

165
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:09,598
then you have a functional explanation

166
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:12,806
which asks what constraints exist so

167
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:15,238
that the system does what it is that the

168
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,974
system does. Here again, you will also

169
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,742
use a lot of contextual modeling, very

170
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:24,380
often evolutionary game theory. So

171
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,530
simulation where we suppose that agent

172
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,722
can have specific traits and those that

173
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,758
reproduce more or that have more fitness

174
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:37,354
give their traits around and you

175
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,966
have the discipline field of study of

176
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:41,886
culture evolution that does that very

177
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,426
concretely by just asking how culture

178
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,926
evolves. So what cultural threats can

179
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:49,506
get more fitness and be transmitted a

180
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,762
very evolutionary centered approach to

181
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,820
social change. So,

182
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,106
to sum all of this up, basically we

183
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,706
explain things by calling on to

184
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:03,874
regularities always and we can

185
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,286
talk about regularities in the

186
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:07,014
phenomenology. So what the system does

187
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,158
in of itself in the structure that is in

188
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:11,254
the language system activity or in the

189
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,934
function that is the constraint that

190
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:16,620
exists over what the stem does and

191
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,038
you have a specific brand of explanatory

192
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:23,190
strategies that try to Legify behavior

193
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,230
to make Nomological lawful explanation

194
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,786
of human behavior and of sociocultural

195
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:32,394
change. And it's not immediately

196
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,654
evident how they do that, how they think

197
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,334
it's a coherent idea to begin with

198
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,782
because well, humans learn culture

199
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:43,826
change so what laws could they be in

200
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:46,322
a field which is changing with time

201
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:50,226
always? So in

202
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:53,350
my opinion it is more a question of

203
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,166
rhetorics than of epistemology because I

204
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:58,150
do not think the answer is coherent.

205
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,442
The answer is, as far as I'm concerned

206
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:06,086
that people they just Raify

207
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:07,786
regularities that are observed in

208
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,914
experimental settings often that are

209
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:13,514
quite heavily fabricated as kind

210
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:15,930
of cognitive laws of behavior.

211
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,790
And because those people usually

212
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,574
agree in spirit to the mechanical kind

213
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:25,802
of explanation they talk about cognitive

214
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,590
mechanism or mental processes but only

215
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,434
insofar that those mechanism or

216
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,774
processes are explanatory of cognitive

217
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,794
laws. They do not do the work of looking

218
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,954
at the structure and function of the

219
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:40,258
systems. They just claim there must be a

220
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,110
mechanism that explain the vague law

221
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,710
that I have observed over 20 people

222
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,070
that came to my lab and these

223
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,878
laws, they are assumed to scale for the

224
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:56,650
explanation of social activity. And so

225
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,826
you have it, you have the recipe for

226
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,180
universal law of social change.

227
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,426
And basically the whole argument

228
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,678
stands on the idea that you have a

229
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,320
presentation or mental processes or

230
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,234
cognitive mechanism that somehow entail

231
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,242
that the subject's behavior is regular

232
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,710
through time and between individuals.

233
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,010
And you never have the work that would

234
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,770
actually in any capacity prove it for

235
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,562
reasons that we will not get into

236
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,546
because it would get math heavy and

237
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:34,614
renty. So if the

238
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,914
rules and regularities of human behavior

239
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,406
can change through learning, through

240
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:40,310
culture, evolution, through whatnot,

241
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,890
how can we exactly model or explain or

242
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,530
even describe this agency?

243
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,014
This is not dwell in anomaly callful

244
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,726
framework because when we do natural

245
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:57,370
laws, we look at regularities, we claim

246
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,374
here is a law, this regularity is a law.

247
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:03,200
So it explains that it exists and

248
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,006
this is a circle. Because as far

249
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,670
as I'm concerned, it's a circular

250
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,802
reasoning. Like the regularities explain

251
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,466
the regularities, which explain the

252
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:17,186
regularities. There is no way out of

253
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,420
this. You can recurse this all day long.

254
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,614
The only fact that you observe the thing

255
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,086
is your explanation for the thing. This

256
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,806
is not, hopefully, how we do Things in

257
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,278
Science. And you have a process

258
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:32,870
of explanation that is more complete.

259
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,274
If you look at structure and function

260
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,730
written lodge you can look at a specific

261
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,310
system which has specific structure.

262
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,058
And you can look at what the system

263
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:44,730
does, the function that the system

264
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,846
enacts a specific point in time. And you

265
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,614
can look at how this function, this

266
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:53,134
activity, shapes the system later on

267
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,960
at T plus one. You can have

268
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,526
developmental approach to things that is

269
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:00,674
centered on how system unfold how they

270
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,554
learn, how they evolve through time that

271
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:06,754
is doable there is no law against that

272
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,690
and it could actually work. So yeah,

273
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,078
let's do that. Let's explain natural

274
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:14,066
phenomenon by describing how the

275
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:16,102
underlying structure work but also by

276
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,862
trying to explain how it's brought about

277
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,646
how the system's activity explain the

278
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:23,480
way it takes shape through time.

279
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,882
So a claim that we will make

280
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:31,866
here that is itself could be

281
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,554
contentious but we don't have to look at

282
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:38,110
why it is not relevant here is that

283
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,270
active inference, which is a specific

284
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,270
new trendy theory of human cognition can

285
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,274
actually explain how regularities

286
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:48,866
underlying social activity be

287
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:50,500
constructed through time.

288
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,982
And let us look at what active inference

289
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:57,714
says precisely. So we

290
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:00,126
won't look at the math ever, we won't

291
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:02,274
look here at the specifics of the

292
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:04,790
theory. The only thing we are going for

293
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,622
is to prove that this theory indeed does

294
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:09,414
what I think it does, which is explain

295
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:11,942
or at least describe in a nontrivial way

296
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:15,290
the evolution of social regulatories.

297
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,626
So if active inference framework is

298
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:23,546
true, then cognitive agents perceive the

299
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:26,814
world through expectation they have

300
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:29,274
developed about the world. So perception

301
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:32,814
is an active process. I do not

302
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:35,914
perceive things with my eyes and compute

303
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:39,294
higher and higher level of traits of

304
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:43,106
what I saw. I basically expect things in

305
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:46,146
front of me and I will actively look at

306
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,954
the things that are most likely to

307
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:50,162
inform me. And something that is

308
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:52,760
critical about this framework is that

309
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,890
the prediction it also underlies action

310
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,014
or policies. So let's say trajectory of

311
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:01,846
action that I enact, I will do the

312
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,606
action that I believe I am more likely

313
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:06,394
to do. I will do that in virtue of me

314
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,746
believing I am more likely to do this

315
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:12,906
action. Whoops. So in

316
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,674
that framework, active inference is

317
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:19,214
understood as a process of enaction of

318
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:23,290
a specific model that is causally

319
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,806
shaped both by an agent's dynamics and

320
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:28,738
an environment Cliodynamics and this

321
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:32,466
relation well, brings a model that

322
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,900
corresponds in abstract way to the

323
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,786
structure of the dynamics of

324
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,380
the relation. And this model I can also

325
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,922
look at it in a way more concrete sense

326
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,846
in that it is what's in the lies what

327
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:49,718
drives the agent dynamic? You have a

328
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:52,118
duality between the Cliodynamics and the

329
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:56,118
epistemic mental states that we put,

330
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:58,118
that we project, that we can observe in

331
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:02,200
the dynamic. So a very important

332
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,826
aspect of this is that world's entirely

333
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:09,870
agency, as we would understand the term.

334
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,706
There is no distinct step of perception

335
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:17,326
which informs the agent on what the

336
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:20,046
world is like and based on which the

337
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,106
agents decide freely what action it

338
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,486
will take. There is a constant

339
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,354
prediction of what is going to happen

340
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,734
and this is enacted by the agent both

341
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,974
through perception and action. So what

342
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:37,890
drives decision here? What drives

343
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,458
generally the flow that analyze

344
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:44,922
the agent behavior is the agent self

345
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:48,218
model and that has interesting

346
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:52,006
consequences. So I have notifications.

347
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:55,180
So we'll cut them sorry,

348
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,726
what? Let me drink. I will drink. I need

349
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:10,478
to drink it.

350
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:14,226
So one consequence of this feminism is

351
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:19,380
that normativity so the values and

352
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,118
norms it's hard to go around that word

353
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:25,846
that drive behavior. They are not in the

354
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,958
brain, they are not something that the

355
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:31,126
agent abstractly relates to. They are

356
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:33,574
Embedded in the very process in which

357
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:36,426
the agent understands and gorges and

358
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,866
navigates the world. And this

359
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,406
is very relevant for a human cultural

360
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,534
evolution because well, we are cultural

361
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:48,682
creatures. We learn expectation

362
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:52,766
about each other both explicitly by

363
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:54,686
looking at how people do things and then

364
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,254
expecting them to do the same things

365
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,122
again and implicitly through the very

366
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:02,974
process by which we relate

367
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:05,362
to other people like norms, like

368
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:09,220
language. And the way you look at

369
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,526
this learning through be, it can

370
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,558
be reduced essentially because of the

371
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,646
properties of active inference to what

372
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:23,706
people call regimes of attention. So the

373
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,722
way I pay attention to things, the

374
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:29,194
specific things I will look at in my

375
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,806
process of understanding and navigating

376
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:31,580
the world,

377
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,054
the flow by which has been that is the

378
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:39,966
same thing as a set of value and a set

379
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:44,014
of expectations. So what

380
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:47,226
is important here is that normativity

381
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,986
and values and things like that, they

382
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:53,522
are Embedded in my cognition in a

383
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,146
much more basic way than conscious self

384
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,966
reflection. Although of course conscious

385
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:01,006
self enaction can inform that flow. It

386
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:04,610
is Embedded in the shared expectation

387
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,790
I have with other people. And there is

388
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,854
no warranty, no result that I can

389
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:11,334
actually be reflexive about it because,

390
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:14,386
well, the way I predict things, it's

391
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:16,754
based on the statistical regulators that

392
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:19,706
have seen in the world and because the

393
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:23,206
way I pay attention, it's entailed

394
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:24,746
by a predictive model of what is going

395
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:28,534
on around me. I'm very constrained,

396
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,214
very much constrained by the statistics

397
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:32,222
I have of the thing I have seen around

398
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,646
me. So regularities drive, how I pay

399
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:37,566
attention, which drive implicit or

400
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:40,926
explicit value and normativity. And you

401
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,594
can add dimical steps, you can add

402
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,530
reflexivity, you can add, I don't know,

403
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,306
accountability, you can add a lot of

404
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:48,466
things, but you cannot remove the very

405
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,966
basic way in which cultural values and

406
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,406
cultural expectation are Embedded in

407
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,270
perception.

408
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,046
Yes, this is a repetition of what I

409
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,206
said, the patterns in the flow of

410
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:04,154
attention that are Embedded that I have

411
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,754
developed through the very fact of

412
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:09,034
engaging with a cultural niche. And they

413
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,682
constrain my actions towards specific

414
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:13,718
outcome. They entail specific values,

415
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,330
specific norms, and they entail,

416
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,550
at least they constrain very heavily

417
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,750
the intention that I'm even able to

418
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,594
conceive to generate. So there

419
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,682
is an equivalent way to see this, which

420
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,446
is engagement with the cultural

421
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:39,138
landscape. So every agent, they

422
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:41,234
experience the world not in the same

423
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,046
way, of course, but they experience the

424
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:47,014
same. Let us say that each

425
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,918
person's experience of the world, it

426
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:51,798
predicts very strongly the experience of

427
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,478
the world that other people will develop

428
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:56,166
around them. So there are structural

429
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:59,446
properties of the landscape,

430
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:02,522
of opportunities and perception and

431
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,380
possible action that we experience.

432
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,154
There are properties that are

433
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,546
transferred between individuals

434
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,630
robustly. This is the case, for example,

435
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,086
of norms. If I

436
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,694
look at a law, any specific law, all of

437
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,774
the people in the same country, they are

438
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,854
subject to the same law. So maybe some

439
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,934
of them can just ignore it. They live

440
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:23,378
too far from the city. We don't have

441
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:26,046
cops here. Maybe some of them are above

442
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,474
the law in some capacity. It's their

443
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,506
relation. But the basic constraints that

444
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,586
the law entail, it is experienced by

445
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,174
everyone in a different way. We will all

446
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:35,298
expect that specific people will react

447
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:37,238
to specific situation in specific way.

448
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:38,966
And this is a real property of the

449
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:43,800
landscape that we experience. So the

450
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,374
way that this landscape shapes

451
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,394
exploitation in a robust way, we can

452
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,494
look at basically it as a constraint.

453
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,106
So not as a derivative property of a

454
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:56,306
landscape that I can or cannot

455
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:58,990
experience, but just as a statistical

456
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,182
force that shapes behavior in a

457
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:06,862
specific way. And looking at things

458
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:09,358
like that, it means that I can see a

459
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:11,474
given sociocultural field in two

460
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,778
complementary way as a set of agents

461
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:16,722
that navigate common well, not quite

462
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:19,682
common, but mutually constrained social,

463
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:22,086
cultural worlds or as a set of

464
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:25,286
constraints that produce itself. And the

465
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:27,782
way agents reconstruct the world around

466
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:29,174
them in their mind, the way they

467
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,002
understand it in a creative manner,

468
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:34,106
it is equivalent to the way the set of

469
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:37,690
constraints reconstruct itself. Which is

470
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,146
important because if I can

471
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:42,794
look at this whole world as a set of

472
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:45,526
constraints over statistical constraints

473
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:48,198
or behavior that reproduce itself, I can

474
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:49,946
look at it as a living thing, strictly

475
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:52,154
speaking, because this is how we define

476
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:55,246
living things, at least in specific sub

477
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:57,454
branch of system biology that I believe

478
00:22:57,572 --> 00:22:59,666
is relevant is to be believed about

479
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:03,042
that. So when we talk

480
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:05,698
about structural landscape, we can look

481
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,802
at them either as a landscape of

482
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,958
affordances. This is opportunity for

483
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,554
action that are experienced and enacted

484
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,782
by a set of individual agents which

485
00:23:15,836 --> 00:23:18,246
interact so as to having some level of

486
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:21,240
coherence between the landscapes they

487
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,666
experience and enact. And I can look at

488
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:26,186
the same landscape as a system of

489
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,034
constraints that are exerted over the

490
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:32,634
behavior of this agent and that I can

491
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,606
define and study with no clear reference

492
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,486
to any individual agent in the same way

493
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:40,782
that I can study a dog without looking

494
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,846
at every single individual cell. What

495
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:44,158
you're interested in, biology or

496
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:46,282
sociology is usually aggregated

497
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:49,042
patterns, not what every single living

498
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,882
thing around thinks of. Every single

499
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:54,594
thing. So that was

500
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:57,986
the heaviest it got probably over the

501
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:58,820
whole course.

502
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,486
I do not expect you to grasp all

503
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,422
of the consequences of what I said

504
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:10,054
because it was very condensed and it was

505
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:13,202
very abstract. But the case I'm making

506
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,418
here is not that everyone has to

507
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,900
understand all the math right now. It is

508
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,066
that this framework, it has things to

509
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:24,282
say about relevant question in social

510
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:26,958
science. And to make this point, I will

511
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,402
not just give the abstract presentation

512
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:30,926
of how it's awesome because we have

513
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:33,374
landscape. Whatnot I will look at

514
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:36,314
specific fields, questions, case studies

515
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:39,818
in social sense and I will look at

516
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:41,906
basically how Oxygen France entails a

517
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:44,946
pretty specific model of that that is

518
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,578
well grounded in committee sense and

519
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:49,474
that is relevant and that is adequate to

520
00:24:49,512 --> 00:24:52,830
the study of living, changing systems,

521
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,426
et cetera, et cetera. So first

522
00:24:57,608 --> 00:25:00,774
agenda setting. Some of you will know

523
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:02,534
what it is, some of you will not know

524
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:06,686
what it is. So Azure

525
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,906
setting is something that is situated in

526
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:10,934
the work on public opinion.

527
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:14,826
Specifically, I believe this book is

528
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,250
called Public Opinion.

529
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,774
So ajana setting. It refers

530
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:23,630
historically, although you have a more

531
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,286
diverse way to understand it now to the

532
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:28,462
role of mass media like journals and

533
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:31,598
later TV in manufacturing Consent. This

534
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,660
is a textualization from the text of

535
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,786
no, I thought I had the book cover, I

536
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:39,986
forgot the name of the guy. I'm sorry

537
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:41,910
you have to look at the reference. But

538
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,494
it is used to study how mass

539
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:48,706
media can manufacture consent by drawing

540
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:51,954
attention to specific issues and shaping

541
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:55,130
specific expectation about the world.

542
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,506
So the idea is that you have a role, an

543
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,626
active role of the elite, what I call

544
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,940
the elite here, people which have

545
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,334
active inference of the flow of policy

546
00:26:08,452 --> 00:26:11,406
or society. I will call them elite. And

547
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:13,626
so those people, they basically transmit

548
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,114
norms, they transmit normative

549
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:18,446
expectation. So consent to whatever is

550
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:20,546
the thing that they do, they want you to

551
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:23,394
do more specifically. And they do so not

552
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:26,066
by telling you do this and that. They do

553
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:29,326
so by building agendas. So drawing

554
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:31,110
attention to specific issues in specific

555
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,190
way. And you can see here people

556
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,702
who are I mean, it's prevalent in

557
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,414
political life. Everyone knows that.

558
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:44,106
But the US. Right wing is very

559
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,746
transparent in doing that. And so this

560
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:48,458
is a meeting between two experts in a

561
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,166
general setting, donald Trump and Ron

562
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:54,202
DeSantis, which basically

563
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,030
have convinced people that they

564
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,166
should not worry about things like, I

565
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,702
don't know, the price of life, whether

566
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:06,286
we wage war here and there. Why do

567
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,594
we have to pay millions? Why do us?

568
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:10,274
People have to pay millions to get

569
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:14,530
health care, but to how LGBTQ Democratic

570
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,770
people threaten the US.

571
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,374
Life in a very abstract way? Like, I did

572
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:25,634
not ever hear any consistent, coherent,

573
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:28,534
believable mechanism by which they

574
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:32,310
explained how LGBTQ threatens whatever

575
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,654
Republicans. But they do draw attention

576
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:37,786
to this topic. They do share the

577
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:40,394
expectation that Democrats and GBTQ are

578
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:43,066
predators. And they do so in a way that

579
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:46,986
is able to legitimize themselves

580
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:50,394
as become other people, to mobilize

581
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:53,854
people to actually be behind them and do

582
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,834
their bidding and to canalize political

583
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,326
life in a way that is convenient for

584
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:00,500
them because it keeps them in power.

585
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,730
And the role of attention,

586
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,250
the way you pay attention to things in

587
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,190
shaping behavior, it's just a redo of

588
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,170
what I explained in active inference.

589
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,278
If you believe that the forces, the way

590
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:20,166
we constrain attention is explicit of

591
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,506
behavior, then you believe in active

592
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:23,346
inference just expressed differently.

593
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,482
So this is a case where you have a

594
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:28,826
classical, let us say, concept in a

595
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:32,074
circle sense that essentially reduces to

596
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:34,586
concepts of active inference. It's not

597
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,714
to say, of course, that astrology is

598
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:37,866
irrelevant and we should just do

599
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:40,506
cognitive sense, but this is pretty rare

600
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:42,222
to have such a direct response between

601
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:45,166
topics that are disciplinary this far

602
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:47,086
apart. So this is something we should

603
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:50,706
definitely pay attention to. So,

604
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:52,850
second case study nationalism.

605
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,478
Basically, this case study is entailed

606
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:58,366
by what I said over the Republicans

607
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:01,154
because the move by which they

608
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,094
legitimize their rule, it is just say we

609
00:29:05,132 --> 00:29:08,182
share an identity here, us,

610
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:10,818
conservative, traditional values, et

611
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,594
cetera, et cetera. And this identity,

612
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:14,762
it entails specific norms. And for

613
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:19,020
reasons that we are usually left out of

614
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,826
the frame, I so elite people run

615
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:25,594
DeSantis, Trump, Napoleon, whoever. I

616
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,814
get to tell you what this entity entails

617
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:30,106
in terms of behavior. You don't get to

618
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:31,854
speak, really, because you are not

619
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:35,226
someone who has newspapers that parrot

620
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:37,646
what I say, what you say, because you

621
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:39,490
have to keep constant with this subject.

622
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,226
And this is very consistent with the

623
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,614
Cliodynamics by which we constructed

624
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:47,454
nation states. So for the historical

625
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:48,946
context, the idea that we have

626
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:51,326
ethnicities and this is somehow

627
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,802
relevant, normatively, like the Slav

628
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:56,294
should organize together or the, I don't

629
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,354
know, Hungarian should organize

630
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:00,454
together, and we should get to agree to

631
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:02,374
things that we do and then do them.

632
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:06,054
It's very recent. It's extremely

633
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:09,434
recent. Dates? Well, I won't get into

634
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:11,322
the specifics, but let us say in this

635
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,986
specific formulation, it dates from the

636
00:30:13,008 --> 00:30:16,046
19th century, when you add a bunch of

637
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,018
very powerful bureaucratic

638
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:18,622
administration that took hold

639
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:22,110
respectively, of France, united Kingdom,

640
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,002
Prussia and they had the capability

641
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:30,210
to rule most of the social activity,

642
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,958
but they did not have any clear argument

643
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:35,634
why people should listen to them in any

644
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:39,780
capacity. And the way

645
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,258
it worked is that those administration

646
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,998
they basically started claiming that

647
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:48,726
they were somehow representative of a

648
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:51,720
given ethnical and linguistic community

649
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,794
and that in virtue of being part of this

650
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:57,002
community you should listen to them and

651
00:30:57,136 --> 00:31:00,698
pay them respect and actively work for

652
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:04,826
their goal to be fulfilled. And of

653
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:06,846
course it is not that easy to make this

654
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:11,482
claim but what happened is they invested

655
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:13,850
a huge deal of energy and organization

656
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,854
into actually having people buy that.

657
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:18,794
They built schools, they built prison,

658
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:21,486
they built psychiatric hospital, they

659
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:23,874
built a lot of infrastructure that

660
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:26,066
enabled them to transmit norms in a very

661
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:27,746
robust way and transmit identity in a

662
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:30,002
very robust way. And in doing that they

663
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,974
managed to embed most of the micro

664
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,046
social relation you could have into

665
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:38,854
their specific ethnicity and into

666
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:41,526
the normative power they lend to this

667
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:45,020
ethnicity. So at some point, you know,

668
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,334
I always forget farmer in a lost

669
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:53,562
village in France you only meet at

670
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:56,922
tax time. So main arm come and tell you

671
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,982
give your grain and you give your grain

672
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:01,774
because else you're dead. And at some

673
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:03,706
point, those people send you a teacher

674
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,214
and they send you newspaper, and they

675
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:07,246
claim, hey, you are French. You have to

676
00:32:07,268 --> 00:32:08,782
speak French. You have to be friends

677
00:32:08,836 --> 00:32:10,718
with us. You have to fight our wars.

678
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:14,658
And because there is so much energy

679
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:16,242
that is pending that people actually

680
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,482
bite or die. That is another option

681
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:22,214
because the other

682
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:26,022
side of the coin is that states that

683
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,926
legitimize themselves through

684
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:30,726
nationhoods they have basically to be

685
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:34,146
all the time invested in ethnic

686
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:35,898
cleansing. Because people who are not

687
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:37,740
the right ethnicity they are not

688
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,834
considered element of these states. So

689
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:44,010
they have to be submitted or removed

690
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,138
which is a bad thing to do. This is a

691
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,090
very bad thing to do ethnic cleansing.

692
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,638
And I'd like

693
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:54,526
to illustrate this whole notion of

694
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:56,314
identity capture through the African

695
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:58,910
Renaissance monument that Abdullah Wade

696
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,274
So, the president of Senegal had

697
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:05,106
constructed in the capital. So it's very

698
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:08,722
glorious. It is very good example

699
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:11,654
of identity because it shows you the

700
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:13,798
norms, it shows your glorious image of

701
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:17,270
the African man and it shows

702
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,406
how you have to be supportive of

703
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:22,646
children, show them, protect them with

704
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,126
your big muscle and give them very wild

705
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:26,986
ambition, while African women look at

706
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:30,506
you like they were non agents.

707
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,638
Let us say that. So it gives a blueprint

708
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:35,146
around which society should be

709
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:38,430
organized. It gives you very

710
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,902
specific picture of who this is speaking

711
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:44,318
to. In this case Africans because I

712
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:47,006
guess Senegal gets to say what is good

713
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:50,974
for Africa. That is coherent

714
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:53,954
claim to make I mean sarcastic, sorry.

715
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:56,734
And why I like this specific monument

716
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,914
well, you have a lot lot well, first,

717
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:01,826
it's very expressive, the Ardotrion in

718
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:03,494
France it serves the basic same function

719
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:06,534
but it does not show you. It tells you

720
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:08,566
and the African society shows you what

721
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,486
it means in a very well obvious way.

722
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:17,674
And the second main reason is this you

723
00:34:17,712 --> 00:34:20,154
have nothing around it. They just put it

724
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,614
in a pile of dirt and they invested

725
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,154
nothing in the infrastructure because

726
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,794
they were too busy taking money for

727
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,494
themselves, I guess. I don't know

728
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:31,102
exactly what did with tax money but

729
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,822
clearly it was more invested in the

730
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:36,974
symbolism of what African men should do

731
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:38,382
and why they should follow him

732
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:40,426
specifically and not in concrete

733
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:43,822
infrastructure. And in most

734
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,754
cases energy capture is very rodeal for

735
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,786
people who are captured. This is why I

736
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:51,874
call that capture because what you get

737
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:54,898
out of energy capture is a symbolic

738
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:57,654
sense of being part of the good team and

739
00:34:57,692 --> 00:34:59,846
what you have to give is usually the

740
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:02,054
entirety of the work you do over your

741
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:06,858
life. It gets given

742
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:08,938
to the state or administration that

743
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,226
wants you to do things and do things for

744
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:14,026
them and sometimes they build

745
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,674
infrastructure but if they don't want

746
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:19,950
to, they will not. That is very

747
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,814
much a bad deal and I

748
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:26,926
gave it away. So national identity, it

749
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:29,310
was diffused to school and mass media.

750
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,018
It was Embedded in a micro network of

751
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:34,206
solidarity. So typically, the African

752
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:37,326
resource Monument, it basically tells

753
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,746
you that as a husband and father, you

754
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:43,142
have to give in whatever the state

755
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:46,694
ideology of Wad was.

756
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,502
And then it is leveraged for

757
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,246
mobilization and legitimation and

758
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:54,166
control. And you

759
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:58,394
have another I

760
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,978
did not say why it was relevant to

761
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:01,158
active inference. Well, it is relevant

762
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:02,986
to Enactive inference because all of

763
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:05,898
this is mediated by self model. All of

764
00:36:05,904 --> 00:36:08,842
this is enabled because people have self

765
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:12,000
model and they enact the self model.

766
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:16,190
And there is no necessity of a reflexive

767
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,926
step where you actually think about what

768
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:22,426
is your self model and you are expected

769
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,290
to do a thing. You do the thing because

770
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,066
you expect yourself to be doing the

771
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:28,210
thing. And active in France, as we said,

772
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,142
you do what you expect to do. So this

773
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:34,546
basically explains why such symbolic raw

774
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:37,222
power it has actual consequences while

775
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:39,446
if you have more rational model of

776
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:42,422
humanity the question is why you build

777
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:45,846
big things and not infrastructure it

778
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:48,858
will be a rational response but this is

779
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:50,838
not what people do. People follow norms

780
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:54,054
and this is a way to broadcast norms

781
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:58,538
very efficiently and robustly. So due

782
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,426
to that I'd like to talk about structure

783
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,482
and agency so there is a constant

784
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,790
question in a social sense, usually

785
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,030
social sense talk about structure so

786
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,482
norms habitus way that institution

787
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:14,706
builds through life and there is a

788
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:19,634
legitimate question that is. Asked which

789
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,682
is if you believe structure to human

790
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:23,614
behavior, what is the place for agency?

791
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,858
So there are constant debates in every

792
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,022
subfield possible of social sense

793
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:31,126
regarding what is actually explained by

794
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,250
this structure and what is left to

795
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,066
individual agency. And what I want to

796
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,742
say is that this question is essentially

797
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:39,546
dissolved by the model of agency we

798
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:43,020
have. So as we said,

799
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,034
agency it's exerted through expectation

800
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:50,890
over myself. So because social structure

801
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,354
it becomes expected, it is enacted

802
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:55,390
through the agency of these specific

803
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,646
people that are within it not have an

804
00:37:57,668 --> 00:38:00,078
opposition between how strong the

805
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,802
institutions are and how agentive people

806
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,866
are because strong institution are

807
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:06,834
institution that basically become

808
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:09,300
Embedded in your self model. And so

809
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,618
there are people freely not freely,

810
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:16,502
it's a bad term but from their own

811
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:18,274
accord they enact those institution.

812
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:20,662
And this is the whole thing about

813
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,550
anticapture, which I presented.

814
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,674
Nationalistic ideology is strong, is

815
00:38:25,712 --> 00:38:26,922
efficient in building actual

816
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,906
mobilization because it makes you

817
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:30,538
believe that you will actually, if you

818
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:34,666
want a court, follow the social

819
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,834
order it gives, which was not

820
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:39,306
unprecedented, but pretty rare in a

821
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:41,490
premodern institution. Usually promoter

822
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,326
institution are I am the king. I have an

823
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:48,094
army. Give me food. And when you have

824
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:50,002
legitimation attempts to actually

825
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:53,954
explain why I should get the food these

826
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:56,674
are pretty much justification. This is

827
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,690
the elite people talking to themselves

828
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,526
about why they are justified knowing

829
00:39:00,558 --> 00:39:04,230
that but you have no arguments and

830
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,758
that would be actually compelling so as

831
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:08,726
to why you would have to give the food

832
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:11,880
and you have no attempt whatsoever to

833
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,130
convince people who have to give the

834
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,914
food they should give the food. This

835
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:19,018
ideology they do not talk to the

836
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,666
people they ask things from, they talk

837
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:24,074
to themselves about why they

838
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,866
can't they are legitimate to take the

839
00:39:25,888 --> 00:39:28,566
things. And so yeah,

840
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:31,658
in those case you have a pretty visible

841
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:32,894
conflicting between structure and

842
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:35,726
agency. Do I do what I'm told to do

843
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,494
under a threat of death or do I do any

844
00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:40,286
other thing? Of course most people would

845
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:41,754
like to do other things but they can't.

846
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:44,386
And I will feel that they can't. But if

847
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,482
you accept that agency is built through

848
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:49,026
normativity, through engagement with a

849
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,334
sociocultural field of finances, of

850
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:54,098
productive action, you have to admit

851
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:56,358
that software exists at least in part

852
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,878
through agency. Because what agent

853
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,120
believe is legitimate, what agents

854
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,386
believe is right, what agent believe is

855
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:09,014
expected. It is very precisely

856
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:12,540
what constitutes structures and

857
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,506
that is insight

858
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:19,726
that is at least in part left out of

859
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,578
the conversation in some field. And I'd

860
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:26,814
like to show why the

861
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:29,046
direct conflict between certain agencies

862
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:31,250
it does not have a strong bonding.

863
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,442
Yes, again, I have said the thing that

864
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:39,154
the slide would say there is another

865
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:41,634
thing that is maybe closer to my core

866
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:44,578
body of work which is how active

867
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:46,646
inference afford indirectly an

868
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:49,480
archaeology of cognitive landscape. So

869
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,774
if socialization is made of constraint

870
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:58,762
over behavior and those constraints are

871
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:00,934
to some extent Embedded in the natural

872
00:41:00,982 --> 00:41:03,402
environment of the people, then we can

873
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:07,274
to some extent study archaeological

874
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:09,342
landscape for themselves. We can look at

875
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:11,920
landscape like material landscape, the

876
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,846
object of study of archaeology, and we

877
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:16,446
can make some inference over the

878
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:19,114
constraints that this landscape entails

879
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:22,686
over collective behavior. I will not get

880
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:24,740
into detail as well as to why, because

881
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,034
it's far call. Making this inference is

882
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:32,146
difficult, but very concretely. We can

883
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:36,326
ask whether you're a key. So the

884
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:37,974
idea that some people get to say to

885
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:39,414
other people what to do and

886
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:41,430
certification, the idea that some people

887
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,680
are by nature above other people,

888
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,534
they can be Embedded in vertical

889
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:48,602
patterning. So you have a claim by

890
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:51,194
people who fund me escape project, look

891
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:54,986
it up, it's nice. You have a claim that

892
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:58,846
to some extent the rectification of

893
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:01,438
society around the Iron Age, it is

894
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:04,394
written, it is Embedded in vertical

895
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,806
patterns in material culture and

896
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:09,486
architecture. And maybe I will not

897
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:12,114
buy the claim outright, but it is very

898
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:13,362
compelling. If you look at specific

899
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:14,562
architecture, you get a specific

900
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:17,374
feeling. So this is the not cathedral,

901
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:20,386
but maybe Basilica of Frequency. I will

902
00:42:20,408 --> 00:42:22,134
not try to say the name because I do not

903
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,526
speak Icelandic, and that would be bad.

904
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,434
But you have very progressive,

905
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,406
compelling curve toward the sky. You

906
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:34,220
have specific feelings that are,

907
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,434
how do you say, produced by this

908
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,042
architecture. And you have a very

909
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:42,646
specific way in which it drives

910
00:42:42,678 --> 00:42:44,426
attention from something wide on the

911
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:48,430
ground to something that goes up. And if

912
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,974
I did not make it clear yet, if we buy

913
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:53,374
active inference, we buy that the

914
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:55,726
patterning of attention, the way you

915
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:57,994
give attention to things, it carries

916
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,380
norms, it carries intentionality and

917
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,610
in first person by introspection.

918
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,586
I think all of you can very clearly see

919
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:09,330
how architecture drives specific

920
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,666
patterns of attention and how those

921
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,878
patterns specific elicit specific

922
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:17,366
feelings. And we currently do not have

923
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,446
models that would be very specific and

924
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:21,574
very Enactive of how this work. But we

925
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:23,994
could this is huge work, but this is

926
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:26,646
doable work. This is not speculations.

927
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,414
And I do not know of another commonism

928
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:30,746
than active in France that would

929
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:31,980
actually make it possible.

930
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,940
And last, I'd like to talk about the

931
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,206
favorite thing in social sense, I guess,

932
00:43:42,308 --> 00:43:44,986
which is thing like a state, scots

933
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:48,658
anthropology of states. So the

934
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:52,398
core argument of Scott's, I'd say it's

935
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:54,946
hard to identify a core argument in that

936
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:58,610
book. But you have ways in which states

937
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,690
so here equivalent to administrations.

938
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,886
They understand the world. They

939
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:04,706
understand the world through written

940
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:07,622
forms that they can pass around many

941
00:44:07,676 --> 00:44:09,862
people, many institution to have

942
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,960
actually a coherent model of the world

943
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,418
that is pretty much abuse. And what

944
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:17,274
should be abuse but is not is that those

945
00:44:17,312 --> 00:44:18,986
models are reductive in the sense any

946
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:21,962
model are. They emphasize specific

947
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:26,110
information and they leave out other

948
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,280
specific information.

949
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,062
And something that is very interesting,

950
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:34,126
I'd say, is that states they tend to

951
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:37,760
push specific models, specific

952
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,430
landscaping, specific norms in urbanism,

953
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,810
specific family norms that build

954
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,306
legibility. So the ability to be

955
00:44:46,328 --> 00:44:48,946
understood by the state. So, for

956
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:53,202
example, you could have very sparse

957
00:44:53,346 --> 00:44:56,306
settlements that are quite autonomous

958
00:44:56,338 --> 00:44:57,478
and that do that thing. It is a

959
00:44:57,484 --> 00:45:00,274
possibility. There is no law or physical

960
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,854
constraint around that. But it is far

961
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:04,646
easier as a state to manage what is very

962
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,742
close to it, right? So for a state,

963
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:09,146
it's good to have a population that

964
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,226
lives very close to the center of power

965
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,954
because those people, they are just

966
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:14,794
there. You can go tell them what to do,

967
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:17,566
it's simple. And you can go ask them

968
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:18,974
things. It's simple too. It's very easy

969
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:22,414
to manage that. And those

970
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,542
people, they would need food to stay

971
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:28,062
there. So we need some kind of food

972
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,754
production model that is easy to take

973
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:33,522
from and that is easy to organize and

974
00:45:33,576 --> 00:45:36,898
goge as a centralized institution. And

975
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,926
this is monoculture, this is agriculture

976
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,786
as we understand it currently. This is

977
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:42,822
people that make big field, that make

978
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,494
the same crop always cereals. Well, not

979
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:47,266
always, sometimes potatoes, but mostly

980
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:49,494
cereals, because cereals, you know,

981
00:45:49,532 --> 00:45:52,246
it's very dense, energetically, it is

982
00:45:52,268 --> 00:45:55,238
easy to keep, it is easy to transport

983
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:58,694
because it is dense and it stay edible

984
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,902
long after recall.

985
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:05,258
You say recall in English cropping. I

986
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:06,346
don't know what is the word, but when

987
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:10,174
you take the food from the plants and

988
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,206
people have to stay there for very long

989
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,094
to cultivate that. So they cannot go

990
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:17,182
around and put potatoes here and there

991
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:19,486
and leave when they don't. So you can

992
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:21,106
just go to people and you know where the

993
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:22,866
people are and where you can take the

994
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:26,674
food and you know when the food is going

995
00:46:26,712 --> 00:46:29,826
to be. Again, I don't know

996
00:46:29,848 --> 00:46:32,926
the word cropped because it's

997
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,870
cereals. It's always the same time.

998
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,942
It's very visible in the landscape how

999
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:41,970
far you are from recollecting cropping.

1000
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,746
So you cannot really have a way to cheat

1001
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:45,726
that. You can just send many norms,

1002
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:48,058
take the food, give it to the city, to a

1003
00:46:48,064 --> 00:46:49,866
different population, and you have a

1004
00:46:49,888 --> 00:46:53,450
very rationalized controllable society.

1005
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,406
And we do not know that

1006
00:46:57,428 --> 00:46:59,162
this is the reason why we have cities

1007
00:46:59,226 --> 00:47:02,842
and monoculture, but we do have traces

1008
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,254
that states very consistently tried to

1009
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:08,994
have big cities and monoculture field

1010
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:11,090
and mostly they succeeded.

1011
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,078
And oh yeah, this is relevant to active

1012
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:18,030
inference because in active inference,

1013
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,946
the way you pay attention to things, it

1014
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,886
is productive of your world, it is

1015
00:47:22,908 --> 00:47:24,998
productive of what cognition you have.

1016
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:27,734
And here the capacity for

1017
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:30,194
administration, the capacity for written

1018
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:32,886
symbols that tell what things are, they

1019
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:35,718
are critical to a state's understanding

1020
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:38,726
of the world. They are what literally

1021
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:41,514
produces the way states pay attention to

1022
00:47:41,552 --> 00:47:45,500
things. And the fact it was basically

1023
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,526
major thing for them to have a world

1024
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:52,250
that looks like this it is very directly

1025
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,886
telling about the

1026
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:58,562
fact it creates a world, it's a direct

1027
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:01,922
instantiation of that and that is a nice

1028
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:03,634
link to do and I'm happy I did this

1029
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:07,554
link. So this is for

1030
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:11,982
the case studies expectedly.

1031
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:14,886
You don't see the corrections, not all

1032
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:16,278
of them maybe you're convinced that

1033
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:18,578
there is something there but most likely

1034
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:21,398
you don't see very precisely what is to

1035
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:24,246
be seen here. So the expectation is that

1036
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,650
over the course, you develop a very

1037
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,118
specific understanding of active

1038
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:30,666
inference. The framework you develop a

1039
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:32,342
specific understanding of how it relates

1040
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:34,474
to social science, to questions that are

1041
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,986
relevant in social science, and you

1042
00:48:37,008 --> 00:48:38,966
develop the capacity to have an informal

1043
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:41,258
opinion on that critical informal

1044
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:44,078
opinion on how this relates to question

1045
00:48:44,164 --> 00:48:48,334
in circle sense. So we

1046
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:50,638
are doing the introduction lecture.

1047
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:52,466
Hopefully I've convinced you there is

1048
00:48:52,488 --> 00:48:55,700
something to see here if not too bad.

1049
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,514
And the next session will be in four

1050
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:01,346
days, not one week, four days. It will

1051
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:04,446
be about basically the basics

1052
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:06,038
of active inference, what you have to

1053
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,770
know to understand, not the framework

1054
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,286
per se because it's math heavy, but what

1055
00:49:11,308 --> 00:49:13,626
the framework says about our life as

1056
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:16,266
cognitive agent. So then you have the

1057
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:20,026
discussion. You should know that for

1058
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:21,254
each lecture there is discussion.

1059
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:23,866
Lecture is vertical, people talk, you

1060
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:26,540
listen. Discussion is more free form.

1061
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:30,526
Every person has basically authority on

1062
00:49:30,548 --> 00:49:31,806
how they share the discussion but the

1063
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:34,794
expectation is that it is a discussion

1064
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:37,326
because it's the name we gave to the

1065
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:40,402
thing. So after the basics we look at

1066
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:42,882
patterns of collective behavior. So how

1067
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:45,202
those elements on cognition, human

1068
00:49:45,256 --> 00:49:48,434
cognition or non human cognition, they

1069
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:51,778
give tools to study the organization of

1070
00:49:51,944 --> 00:49:55,758
collective systems like ant colonies

1071
00:49:55,934 --> 00:49:59,318
or societies but we'll stay in not

1072
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:01,718
specific to human approach. We'll be

1073
00:50:01,724 --> 00:50:04,294
interested in collective behavior but

1074
00:50:04,332 --> 00:50:06,458
will not be interested in the specific

1075
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:08,922
patterns of collective behavior as

1076
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,926
afforded by human cognition. Then we'll

1077
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,658
look at semiotics and semantics, the

1078
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:15,610
evolution of symbols so things that are

1079
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,898
closer to humans, we'll look at how

1080
00:50:17,984 --> 00:50:19,486
Enactive inference accounts for

1081
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:21,434
evolution of symbol and what evolution

1082
00:50:21,482 --> 00:50:25,374
of symbol affords for cognition and then

1083
00:50:25,412 --> 00:50:28,222
from here we'll look at very social

1084
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,686
sensey things norm, script, narrative

1085
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:34,226
language. So how this discussion on

1086
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:35,726
active inference and collective behavior

1087
00:50:35,758 --> 00:50:37,794
and semiotics? They inform very

1088
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:40,100
directly. They give a model specific

1089
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,358
principled, predictive model of social

1090
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:46,710
human behavior. And then we'll look at

1091
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,766
so my thing, the way I like to think of

1092
00:50:49,788 --> 00:50:52,006
it all, which is social constraints and

1093
00:50:52,028 --> 00:50:54,634
we'll go back to the claim that there

1094
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:57,382
are landscapes of social, cultural

1095
00:50:57,446 --> 00:50:59,754
cognition thingy thing. And those

1096
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:01,740
landscapes can be looked at in

1097
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:05,062
abstracted from the individual scale

1098
00:51:05,206 --> 00:51:08,234
manner. And this is explanatory of

1099
00:51:08,272 --> 00:51:11,438
cultural change. And then we go for the

1100
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,646
conclusion. So we'll be interested in

1101
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:15,086
your opinion of the course. This is the

1102
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:16,798
first run we'd like to have feedback, a

1103
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:18,786
lot of feedback on what you thought of

1104
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:20,740
it and what would make it good.

1105
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,374
So that will be for the conclusion

1106
00:51:25,422 --> 00:51:28,722
discussion. So here I

1107
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:31,060
hoped that you'd present yourself.

1108
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,774
We have not the capacity right now to

1109
00:51:34,812 --> 00:51:38,230
have students take the screen

1110
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,294
and talk. But I'd like to know,

1111
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,746
you can say in the chat what is your

1112
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,014
background, what are your expectation

1113
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,442
for the course? Whatever you want to say

1114
00:51:50,496 --> 00:51:54,122
about things, the world preferably being

1115
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:55,798
related somehow to the course. That

1116
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:59,758
would be nice, but yeah, please tell

1117
00:51:59,844 --> 00:52:06,270
things to Usher.

1118
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:14,562
That concludes my talk. I thought this

1119
00:52:14,616 --> 00:52:18,626
slide made it clear we

1120
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:23,474
have last thing, maybe we considered

1121
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:27,154
making projects. So you making projects

1122
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:30,566
that we read and maybe how

1123
00:52:30,588 --> 00:52:33,946
do you say grades. But I do

1124
00:52:33,968 --> 00:52:35,706
not think that we are in capacity to

1125
00:52:35,728 --> 00:52:39,862
give standardized

1126
00:52:39,926 --> 00:52:43,514
normalized degree or attestation that

1127
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:46,154
has any value. So we decided not to do

1128
00:52:46,192 --> 00:52:49,946
it. So asking you to

1129
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:52,346
do things, to do projects is a bit weird

1130
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,718
if we're not going to grade it and

1131
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,374
attest that you did it. But if you want

1132
00:52:57,412 --> 00:52:59,758
to do it, if you want to write things

1133
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,626
and send them to us for review, this is

1134
00:53:02,648 --> 00:53:05,474
very okay, you can do that. We're not

1135
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:07,394
formally invited to do that, but you can

1136
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:10,706
do it. Well, I'll just add a point on

1137
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:12,854
that and then meanwhile, if anybody

1138
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:14,534
wants to ask a question in the live

1139
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:18,002
chat, we did raise

1140
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:20,594
this topic of different qualifications

1141
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:21,846
and it's something that we've been

1142
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:25,002
working on and continue to work on in

1143
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:28,122
the Institute. So potentially in future

1144
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:30,458
versions, but absolutely in future

1145
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,794
offerings, we will have these kinds of

1146
00:53:32,832 --> 00:53:35,754
courses. But as Avel mentioned, this is

1147
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:38,782
kind of a first run and so it's really

1148
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:40,366
exciting just to even start that

1149
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:42,574
conversation and see what people are

1150
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:44,670
looking for in terms of certification.

1151
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,358
All right, so let's go to some questions

1152
00:53:47,444 --> 00:53:49,810
in the live chat and comments.

1153
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,434
Oh yeah, go ahead. I did not make the

1154
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:57,586
escalation clear, but because it is a

1155
00:53:57,608 --> 00:53:59,118
first and because we are still shipping

1156
00:53:59,134 --> 00:54:01,970
the course, it is so much more important

1157
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,294
that you actually tell us what you

1158
00:54:04,332 --> 00:54:07,078
expect out of it. Like what you want or

1159
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:09,750
what you perceive will be here.

1160
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,462
Expect in the active inference sense,

1161
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:13,870
that is a bit perception, a bit action.

1162
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,706
Please tell us about that. Awesome. In

1163
00:54:17,728 --> 00:54:19,366
fact, the only way to reduce one's

1164
00:54:19,398 --> 00:54:21,910
uncertainty is through active engagement

1165
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,806
and one is literally applying active

1166
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:26,842
inference when they do actively engage

1167
00:54:26,906 --> 00:54:30,046
in this epistemic way. So I hope that

1168
00:54:30,068 --> 00:54:33,582
all comes through. All right, a first

1169
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:36,670
question from Sfumato in the chat. Does

1170
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,514
active inference provide us with

1171
00:54:38,552 --> 00:54:42,030
predictive power, potentially focusing

1172
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,346
on human or social scale issues?

1173
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:47,666
What does it look like? Or where would

1174
00:54:47,688 --> 00:54:49,682
you say active inference provides us

1175
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:52,114
with predictive power or unique

1176
00:54:52,162 --> 00:54:53,750
explanations and predictions?

1177
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,838
So yes or no,

1178
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:00,518
depending on the granularity of your

1179
00:55:00,524 --> 00:55:02,146
question. So what you look at Enactive

1180
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:03,910
inference and not Enactive inference.

1181
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,298
Active inference is a branch of

1182
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:08,220
predictive processing. So it's a family

1183
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,538
in cognition that consider

1184
00:55:12,704 --> 00:55:14,842
that your perception of the world is

1185
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:17,454
based on prediction. You have two

1186
00:55:17,492 --> 00:55:19,422
specificity of active inference within

1187
00:55:19,476 --> 00:55:21,770
predictive processing. One specificity

1188
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:25,790
is that it says that action are

1189
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,926
predictive are based on prediction too.

1190
00:55:29,028 --> 00:55:30,898
The other is that it proposed basically

1191
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:33,122
a mathematical formalism in which to

1192
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:35,954
study that that grounds the claim but

1193
00:55:35,992 --> 00:55:37,794
also constrained the mechanisms a little

1194
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:40,786
bit. Predictive processing as a family

1195
00:55:40,888 --> 00:55:44,706
is predictive of many things. It's

1196
00:55:44,738 --> 00:55:46,806
predictive of the fact that basically

1197
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,998
you think you see things, but you are

1198
00:55:49,004 --> 00:55:50,646
not in capacity to perceive them right

1199
00:55:50,668 --> 00:55:54,362
now. So I see bit

1200
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,830
of tissue, no fabric

1201
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:01,434
that is beyond my computer and I see the

1202
00:56:01,472 --> 00:56:03,930
patterns in it but I know perfectly well

1203
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,266
that the cell that are actually that

1204
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:07,674
have the precision to see those

1205
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:10,270
patterns, they are looking at the screen

1206
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,174
now. So I cannot possibly know what the

1207
00:56:12,212 --> 00:56:14,846
patterns are except if I expect it and

1208
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:16,766
this is what shaped my perception. So

1209
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:17,978
this is predicted by predictive

1210
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:20,786
processing and what is also predicted is

1211
00:56:20,808 --> 00:56:23,026
that basically the information flow in

1212
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:26,482
the perception part of the brain it is

1213
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:29,220
heavily top down. You have more

1214
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,514
bandwidth that goes from visual cortex

1215
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:36,214
to the retina than reciprocal which

1216
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:40,550
is simply not compatible with direct

1217
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,562
perception, passive perception kind of

1218
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:46,026
model. It is, however, compatible with

1219
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:48,378
the idea that we predict the content of

1220
00:56:48,464 --> 00:56:51,802
retinal activity and when our

1221
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:53,434
enaction is wrong, then you have

1222
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:56,634
feedback, you have perception error

1223
00:56:56,682 --> 00:56:58,906
propagation. So this is pure predictive

1224
00:56:58,938 --> 00:57:01,246
processing, this is explained by

1225
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:03,022
predictive processing. This is

1226
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:07,150
contradictory actively with most

1227
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,126
conceivable variants of non predictive

1228
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:12,158
processing. So yeah, Enactive processing

1229
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:16,770
is Enactive and I'd say it's not

1230
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,382
up for debate as I know active in France

1231
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:23,814
it takes in addition the idea that the

1232
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:27,814
actions are based on prediction. I do

1233
00:57:27,852 --> 00:57:30,230
not know what work, empirical work

1234
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,594
existed to check whether this

1235
00:57:33,632 --> 00:57:35,974
is specifically the case. Maybe Daniel,

1236
00:57:36,022 --> 00:57:38,220
you know what has been done about this?

1237
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,658
Complete your answer and I'll give a

1238
00:57:41,664 --> 00:57:45,786
thought. OK, so there

1239
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:48,320
are conceivable empirical settings that

1240
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,246
would check that out. I do not know of

1241
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:52,894
them, so I will not claim that they

1242
00:57:52,932 --> 00:57:56,974
exist or do not exist. What is important

1243
00:57:57,092 --> 00:57:59,534
to me is the mathematical grounding

1244
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:02,958
because most model of cognition

1245
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:05,666
kind of assume that we have

1246
00:58:05,768 --> 00:58:08,142
computational power that is implemented

1247
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:11,666
somehow, somewhere by meat.

1248
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:15,560
And this is wrong.

1249
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,974
We cannot just suppose that the big

1250
00:58:18,012 --> 00:58:19,974
properties that the brain have, they

1251
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:23,046
must exist somehow, somewhere, we have

1252
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:25,286
to actually explain it. And this is what

1253
00:58:25,388 --> 00:58:28,498
the mathematical formalism behind active

1254
00:58:28,514 --> 00:58:30,314
inference energy principle does. It

1255
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:33,542
explains that we should expect chemical

1256
00:58:33,606 --> 00:58:37,082
system to be predictive somehow and

1257
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:39,294
although it is not directly made in

1258
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:42,206
math, it is pretty easy to see why the

1259
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,726
brain should have a lot of power at

1260
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:46,880
doing that because of the very

1261
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,754
heavy tune power for the mecholatunment

1262
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:50,640
it has.

1263
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:57,170
But I would not if active inference is

1264
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,306
empirically distinct from other case of

1265
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,534
predictive processing. I am not sure

1266
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,762
how. I cannot think of an experiment

1267
00:59:05,826 --> 00:59:08,534
or empirical observation that definitely

1268
00:59:08,652 --> 00:59:11,186
discriminates between active inference

1269
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,538
and non active inference. Predictive

1270
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:16,810
processing. I think it exists.

1271
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,162
Great, thank you. Well, in many ways,

1272
00:59:19,216 --> 00:59:20,854
active inference is predictive

1273
00:59:20,902 --> 00:59:24,794
processing with action under

1274
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:27,898
additional sophistication and richness,

1275
00:59:27,994 --> 00:59:30,282
supported by the free energy principle.

1276
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:32,126
These are technical topics that we

1277
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:34,766
explore in other discussions as to

1278
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:37,198
whether Enactive inference gives us

1279
00:59:37,284 --> 00:59:40,718
unique explanation or enaction capacity.

1280
00:59:40,894 --> 00:59:43,714
One could look to, for example, the

1281
00:59:43,752 --> 00:59:45,986
linear regression or any other type of

1282
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:48,302
statistical framework. Linear

1283
00:59:48,366 --> 00:59:51,118
regressions in and of themselves don't

1284
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:52,918
make predictions because you need a

1285
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:54,710
target to make a prediction about.

1286
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,702
However, given a linear regression model

1287
00:59:57,836 --> 00:59:59,974
relating to health outcomes, for

1288
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,582
example, you might use that model to

1289
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:04,370
reduce your uncertainty, which is to

1290
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,554
say, have predictive power about that

1291
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:08,346
system of interest. And so in that

1292
01:00:08,368 --> 01:00:10,474
respect, active inference has been used

1293
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:13,862
to develop a host of unique explanations

1294
01:00:13,926 --> 01:00:16,446
and predictions related to a variety of

1295
01:00:16,468 --> 01:00:18,522
cognitive and behavioral phenomena.

1296
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:21,306
I'll just leave it at that, and I'll

1297
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:24,878
read some introductions and such in the

1298
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:28,182
chat. So Robin writes

1299
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:30,526
hi, my name is Robin. I work in digital

1300
01:00:30,558 --> 01:00:32,500
governance. Yeah, go ahead.

1301
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,214
What makes that I buy active inference

1302
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:40,062
as a mechanical model of human cognition

1303
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:45,714
is that you don't really get adaptive

1304
01:00:45,762 --> 01:00:49,794
enaction without some variant of action

1305
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:52,994
being predicted, because the default

1306
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,426
picture would be that you have to

1307
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:56,966
planify a full action trajectory.

1308
01:00:57,158 --> 01:01:00,794
But there is no compatible way this

1309
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:02,826
can be fast enough and robust enough and

1310
01:01:02,848 --> 01:01:04,806
not costly enough to underlie adaptive

1311
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:08,014
action. So basically you'd say I have to

1312
01:01:08,052 --> 01:01:10,298
grab a cup. I would look at the cup,

1313
01:01:10,394 --> 01:01:12,750
see the cup, planify movements,

1314
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,742
Enactive the movements. If something

1315
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:18,046
happens, if I was slightly wrong about

1316
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:21,934
the position of the cup, the algorithm

1317
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:24,642
is too heavy for me to adjust. So you

1318
01:01:24,776 --> 01:01:27,714
not be able to navigate anything at

1319
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:29,582
limit information or that is changing.

1320
01:01:29,646 --> 01:01:31,374
And we are very good at navigating

1321
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:32,966
things at misinformation which are

1322
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:35,990
changing. So until there is another

1323
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,658
mechanical model that predicts attuned

1324
01:01:38,754 --> 01:01:41,126
adaptive action, I will have to buy

1325
01:01:41,148 --> 01:01:45,180
active inference as a model of

1326
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:47,754
human conditions, basically because the

1327
01:01:47,792 --> 01:01:51,194
mass underlying is pretty solid, in my

1328
01:01:51,232 --> 01:01:53,882
opinion. Yeah, it's always a great

1329
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:56,220
question. It's relative to what

1330
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,934
measurements need a comparator. And so

1331
01:01:59,972 --> 01:02:01,390
active inference with Enactive value

1332
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,002
relative to something unspecified

1333
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:06,238
doesn't really make sense, but we can

1334
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:08,622
evaluate it better or worse in a certain

1335
01:02:08,676 --> 01:02:10,158
setting, and so it's important to

1336
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:12,082
compare it. So I'll just read a couple

1337
01:02:12,136 --> 01:02:15,346
introductions. Robin wrote hi, my name

1338
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:17,390
is Robin. I work in digital governance.

1339
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,438
I've been curious about applying active

1340
01:02:19,454 --> 01:02:20,966
inference to the construction of

1341
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:22,854
governance for digital commons. Great

1342
01:02:22,892 --> 01:02:26,486
kickoff Sfumato wrote hi,

01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:28,802
I've been studying fundamental physics

1344
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:31,654
and now I am doing Cliodynamics with a

1345
01:02:31,692 --> 01:02:33,646
current interest in pragmatist

1346
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:36,198
philosophy. I came to discover active

1347
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:38,346
inference and see how to apply it to

1348

1354
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,126
that active inference is very relevant

1355
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:06,354
to expect to learn and engage and

1356
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:09,586
Gina writes hi, I'm a biologist and

1357

the theory to do experiments with the

1359

Xscape team. Cool. Well,

1360
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,482
people can continue to add introductions

1361
01:03:20,626 --> 01:03:22,966
or questions in the Chat ben if you want

1362
01:03:22,988 --> 01:03:28,874
to ask or reflect on anything or

1363
01:03:28,912 --> 01:03:30,954
I'm sure there's more things to talk

1364
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:31,580
about.

1365
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,166
Yeah, I thought that was a fantastic

1366
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:38,238
introduction. Some very interesting

1367
01:03:38,324 --> 01:03:39,754
connections that I wasn't expecting

1368
01:03:39,802 --> 01:03:42,234
there. Nice to see Manufacturing Consent

1369
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:46,046
making an appearance and

1370
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:48,046
a lot that I think I can hold on, let me

1371
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:50,914
turn on my camera. Yeah, certainly a lot

1372
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,970
that I want to pick up on and hopefully

1373
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:57,326
circle back around to in the session.

1374
01:03:57,358 --> 01:03:58,180
That I'll be.

1375
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,206
Cool. Cool. By the way, what I wanted

1376
01:04:04,248 --> 01:04:05,926
to say earlier, and I could check now,

1377
01:04:05,948 --> 01:04:09,186
is that I believed that Manufacturing

1378
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:11,126
Consent was a Chomsky thing, but it is

1379
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,426
not. It is a Lipman thing, which is the

1380
01:04:13,468 --> 01:04:16,682
guy that basically funded the very

1381
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:19,066
notion of public opinion in the 30s in

1382
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:22,154
the book called Public Opinion. The book

1383
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,866
is co authored with Chomsky, though.

1384
01:04:23,888 --> 01:04:27,626
No, Chomsky was not. He was

1385
01:04:27,648 --> 01:04:29,626
maybe eight at the time. I very much

1386
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:33,386
doubt he actually did a thing. I'm sure

1387
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:34,954
I have a copy of. That book on my shelf

1388
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:36,554
and I'm. Pretty sure there are no copy

1389
01:04:36,602 --> 01:04:38,346
of the book. Manufacturing Consent by

1390
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:41,262
Chomsky. The expression Manufacturing

1391
01:04:41,326 --> 01:04:45,250
Consent is from a 30s book Public

1392
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,934
Opinion by Walter Lickman that founded

1393
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:50,098
the whole public opinion thing,

1394
01:04:50,264 --> 01:04:52,006
according to Wikipedia at least. I did

1395
01:04:52,028 --> 01:04:54,934
not looked for a specific book that

1396
01:04:54,972 --> 01:04:57,062
would specifically maybe last Public

1397
01:04:57,116 --> 01:05:00,902
Opinion because what do we mean

1398
01:05:00,956 --> 01:05:02,598
by public opinion? I don't know.

1399
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:04,762
Lordbond does not go clearly, but maybe

1400
01:05:04,816 --> 01:05:07,526
something else goes, I don't know. It's

1401
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:10,220
created for that. I can at least say it.

1402
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,994
That's kind of the interesting question

1403
01:05:14,112 --> 01:05:17,230
about multiscale systems and emergence.

1404
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:21,358
If we enable or grant that brains can

1405
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:23,774
perceive or do things that a single

1406
01:05:23,812 --> 01:05:25,966
neuron can't, but that they have a

1407
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,538
material relationship to one another,

1408
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,726
then is public opinion just like a pile

1409
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:33,890
of sand? It just represents the

1410
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,646
summation of the nest mates?

1411
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:39,826
Or does public opinion represent a

1412
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:42,262
singular integrated unit in its own

1413
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:43,846
respect, one that might have to be

1414
01:05:43,868 --> 01:05:46,562
sampled by investigating the material

1415
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:49,222
constituents but still being something

1416
01:05:49,276 --> 01:05:50,520
different from that?

1417
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,918
I'll just go to a question in the chat

1418
01:05:54,934 --> 01:05:57,946
or Aval, if you have a thought. Does a

1419
01:05:57,968 --> 01:06:00,010
pile of sand have semantics?

1420
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,274
I loved it. For an observer or for

1421
01:06:05,312 --> 01:06:08,186
itself? Sorry? Does the pile of sand

1422
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:10,014
have semantics for an observer or for

1423
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:13,642
itself? Good question. For observer,

1424
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:16,910
I guess. Not really for itself.

1425
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,418
Clearly not really not. That is

1426
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:24,210
symmetry. But I can put together brain

1427
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:26,962
and public opinion, different

1428
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,482
coordination mechanisms, but still

1429
01:06:28,536 --> 01:06:32,386
coordinated systems yeah,

1430
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,258
complex adaptive systems in an

1431
01:06:34,264 --> 01:06:37,218
unfavorable sense. If the sand is piling

1432
01:06:37,234 --> 01:06:39,094
up at the bottom of an hourglass, it

1433
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:41,378
certainly has semantics for an observer

1434
01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:43,270
who knows about hourglasses.

1435
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:48,054
Michael says hello. Haptivist.

1436
01:06:48,102 --> 01:06:50,540
Greetings, Michael and asks a question.

1437
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,946
Please further contrast the terms

1438
01:06:54,128 --> 01:06:57,434
regimes of attention and sociocultural

1439
01:06:57,482 --> 01:06:58,590
landscapes.

1440
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:05,066
Contrast as in explain what the terms

1441
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:08,154
are? I guess, yeah. How are those terms

1442
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:09,260
similar or different?

1443
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,660
I do not see basically,

1444
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,366
we active inference people. I did not

1445
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:23,714
have the ID propose regimes of

1446
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:27,026
attention. So specific patterns in

1447
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:30,980
the way your attention flows as

1448
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,034
an explanatory mechanism. Let us say

1449
01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:36,066
what underlies the experience of

1450
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:37,598
cognitive landscape. Cognitive landscape

1451
01:07:37,614 --> 01:07:41,734
you understood whatever is the array of

1452
01:07:41,772 --> 01:07:45,880
things that you as an agent experience

1453
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:50,246
as your world. And then we active

1454
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:53,082
inference people also claim that the

1455
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:55,530
coordination between individuals in

1456
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,554
cultural agency. So the way we co

1457
01:07:58,592 --> 01:08:01,306
construct synchronize regime of

1458
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:03,754
attention means that there is a coupling

1459
01:08:03,802 --> 01:08:05,454
between the landscape that we

1460
01:08:05,492 --> 01:08:07,854
experience. So landscape that are

1461
01:08:07,892 --> 01:08:09,486
constrained in such a way I will call

1462
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:11,274
social cultural landscape because it's

1463
01:08:11,322 --> 01:08:14,238
easier than saying cognitive landscape

1464
01:08:14,254 --> 01:08:15,566
that are constrained by sociocultural

1465
01:08:15,598 --> 01:08:19,902
processes. Is that satisfying?

1466
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:21,922
Yeah, it's great. I'll just give another

1467
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:26,950
view on that. A sociocultural landscape

1468
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,194
is something like the ecological

1469
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:35,410
landscape or the actual basis materially

1470
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,506
of our system of interest, what we are

1471
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,514
studying in sociology. And so it

1472
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:45,002
consists of inert objects as well as

1473
01:08:45,056 --> 01:08:48,614
animate cognitive entities whereas

1474
01:08:48,742 --> 01:08:52,030
regimes of attention refers to the

1475
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,654
dynamical patterns of attention which

1476
01:08:56,692 --> 01:09:00,654
is to say relevance and salience for

1477
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:04,126
cognitive agents. And so the socio

1478
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:05,762
cultural landscape, to use an example

1479
01:09:05,816 --> 01:09:08,350
from Avel's presentation,

1480
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,714
might include the modified niche that

1481
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:15,650
includes a monument and then a given

1482
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,546
cognitive agent might, when they gaze

1483
01:09:18,578 --> 01:09:22,770
upon that landscape in an encultured

1484
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:26,150
fashion, have a regime of attention such

1485
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:29,594
that their eyes are moved towards

1486
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:33,574
the point of a monument. But the regime

1487
01:09:33,622 --> 01:09:36,762
of attention is modeled as a pattern of

1488
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:40,598
dynamics of a single cognitive agent.

1489
01:09:40,784 --> 01:09:43,054
And in Enactive inference we model

1490
01:09:43,172 --> 01:09:47,150
attention as covert or internal action.

1491
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:53,322
I want to add something. I use possibly

1492
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:57,442
abuse vitaminscape because

1493
01:09:57,496 --> 01:09:59,838
it has a very specific meaning

1494
01:10:00,014 --> 01:10:02,626
connotation, which is a space that you

1495
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:05,938
can gaze at. A landscape

1496
01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:08,470
is a space that you can gaze at.

1497
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:12,774
And if you go to a

1498
01:10:12,812 --> 01:10:15,494
more mathematical notion of space you

1499
01:10:15,532 --> 01:10:18,474
will basically find very closely the

1500
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:21,626
expectation or formal entailment that

1501
01:10:21,648 --> 01:10:24,394
this space represent the set of

1502
01:10:24,432 --> 01:10:26,700
possibilities accessible to a system.

1503
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:31,934
This is all there is to it. And this

1504
01:10:31,972 --> 01:10:33,566
is not what a cognitive landscape is.

1505
01:10:33,588 --> 01:10:36,606
It's not the set of possibilities that

1506
01:10:36,628 --> 01:10:38,030
abstractly an agent could experience.

1507
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,520
It is what an agent experiences. No what

1508
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,320
can gaze at know.

1509
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,382
So this is why the notion of a landscape

1510
01:10:48,446 --> 01:10:51,058
is very heavily used. It does not have a

1511
01:10:51,064 --> 01:10:54,002
clear mathematical meaning it should

1512
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:57,174
have because it has a very specific,

1513
01:10:57,292 --> 01:11:01,314
well conceptual meaning that is critical

1514
01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:03,254
to the understanding we have of

1515
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:06,600
cognition and that is not afforded by

1516
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:10,666
set theory. So most mathematics we would

1517
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:14,518
use the brand

1518
01:11:14,534 --> 01:11:16,138
of mathematics we teach in school and

1519
01:11:16,144 --> 01:11:18,694
that physicists use. Most physicists,

1520
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,870
not all physicists. Well, if we consider

1521
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,938
like Waddington's epigenetic landscape

1522
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:27,102
or if we consider the surface that

1523
01:11:27,156 --> 01:11:29,454
variational free energy is optimized on

1524
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:31,726
as a landscape, it gives us a lot of

1525
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:33,666
really good intuitions. It gives us

1526
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:36,798
something to gaze upon as instrumental

1527
01:11:36,894 --> 01:11:40,420
modelers, but it is not the same as

1528
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:44,238
the landscape of trees.

1529
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,066
Even though each one of those trees

1530
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:49,798
might be modeled by an observer as

1531
01:11:49,964 --> 01:11:53,046
possessing an epigenetic landscape or a

1532
01:11:53,068 --> 01:11:55,350
regime of attention or a free energy

1533
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,470
landscape.

1534
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:02,506
Well, if anyone has other thoughts or

1535
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:04,780
questions, we can consider them.

1536
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,250
Otherwise.

1537
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,742
Just give me a second. I don't think

1538
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:15,326
everyone has do

1539
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:18,320
you see the image? Yeah,

1540
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:20,906
it's small, but Waddington's landscape.

1541
01:12:20,938 --> 01:12:21,982
There you go. Thank you. Yeah,

1542
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:24,370
Waddington's landscape. So it is a very

1543
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,426
old thirty s. Twenty s?

1544
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:30,734
Thirty s, I guess thing in evolutionary

1545
01:12:30,782 --> 01:12:34,258
biology. So Waddington is,

1546
01:12:34,344 --> 01:12:37,314
let us say, the founder of contemporary

1547
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:40,226
developmental biology. And the landscape

1548
01:12:40,258 --> 01:12:45,106
are basically dynamical fitness.

1549
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:47,138
I do not know how to not say landscape.

1550
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,802
That is a problem. They're basically the

1551
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:53,530
space in which agent can evolve.

1552
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:56,214
The phenotype of the agent can evolve

1553
01:12:56,262 --> 01:13:00,654
during its development. And this

1554
01:13:00,692 --> 01:13:04,010
is a very grounded

1555
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,794
visual metaphor,

1556
01:13:06,842 --> 01:13:09,678
symbolism, I don't know for the study of

1557
01:13:09,684 --> 01:13:12,606
developmental system. So this is why we

1558
01:13:12,628 --> 01:13:14,994
told Cough landscape for the gazing and

1559
01:13:15,032 --> 01:13:17,666
for this historical grounding of the

1560
01:13:17,688 --> 01:13:20,290
developmental studies in biology.

1561
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,500
And also I literally am paid to

1562
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,362
landscape archaeology. So yeah, let's

1563
01:13:27,426 --> 01:13:28,966
overuse it on landscape. That is good

1564
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,726
for me. Cool. But it's an example

1565
01:13:32,828 --> 01:13:36,086
of using our spatial and

1566
01:13:36,108 --> 01:13:40,250
Embodied experience to get a grasp

1567
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,130
on different conceptual topics.

1568
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:46,586
Ben, you have any comments or I'd. Love

1569
01:13:46,608 --> 01:13:49,610
to hear a little ask about this image.

1570
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,914
There's a couple of words that I was

1571
01:13:51,952 --> 01:13:53,738
expecting to creep into this discussion

1572
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:56,286
that did not, which are attractors and

1573
01:13:56,308 --> 01:13:58,382
repellers Avel when you mentioned

1574
01:13:58,436 --> 01:14:00,334
dynamical systems. I wonder if you think

1575
01:14:00,372 --> 01:14:01,982
these are useful terms for thinking

1576
01:14:02,036 --> 01:14:04,466
about because attraction goes very

1577
01:14:04,488 --> 01:14:06,302
naturally with thinking about attention.

1578
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:08,146
And I wonder if you think this is a

1579
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:11,394
useful kind of linguistic tool for

1580
01:14:11,432 --> 01:14:13,540
visualizing the relationship between

1581
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,294
social cognitive landscapes and

1582
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:17,030
attention.

1583
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,144
Do you see the social constraints

1584
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:27,364
diagram now? Okay, I wanted to have it

1585
01:14:27,402 --> 01:14:29,124
if there is a screenshot laying around,

1586
01:14:29,162 --> 01:14:30,872
I wanted this to be the screen share.

1587
01:14:31,006 --> 01:14:33,828
So attractors and repellers. We're

1588
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,896
basically talking fitness when we're

1589
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:37,396
talking landscape, we're talking fitness

1590
01:14:37,428 --> 01:14:39,256
landscapes. So I guess it kind of

1591
01:14:39,278 --> 01:14:40,728
entails the notion of attractors and

1592
01:14:40,734 --> 01:14:43,956
repellers. Now, there are many reasons

1593
01:14:43,988 --> 01:14:46,420
why I'd stay away from the Mikola system

1594
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:49,150
terminology because well,

1595
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,156
the Mikol system, they entail the

1596
01:14:52,178 --> 01:14:54,076
preformulation of all possibilities of

1597
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:56,928
the system, which I think is very wrong

1598
01:14:57,014 --> 01:14:59,152
to do for biological system and social

1599
01:14:59,206 --> 01:15:02,332
system system that undergo open ended

1600
01:15:02,396 --> 01:15:05,552
evolution and reconstruction. So I stay

1601
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:08,464
away from this formalism whenever

1602
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:12,688
possible. And attractor technically

1603
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:16,432
mean subregions that you cannot possibly

1604
01:15:16,496 --> 01:15:19,708
get out, which exists

1605
01:15:19,824 --> 01:15:22,970
in conservative system, basically. But

1606
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,608
in all cases that we're interested

1607
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:28,760
about, it's technically not a tractor.

1608
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,856
And we can't think of

1609
01:15:32,878 --> 01:15:34,284
it as a tractor at a specific time

1610
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:37,532
scale. It's okay. But then if we have to

1611
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,476
abuse the formalism this much, why not

1612
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:43,230
not use the formalism? That would be my

1613
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,436
flow of reflection about this

1614
01:15:45,538 --> 01:15:48,168
terminology. I understand the tractors

1615
01:15:48,184 --> 01:15:49,904
as states that have visited more

1616
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,616
regularly than others. So is there

1617
01:15:51,638 --> 01:15:53,170
something about that that's not correct?

1618
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,770
I will check it out.

1619
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,604
Yeah. An attracting set is one that is

1620
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:02,230
revisited, but there are of course many

1621
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,344
sub definitions to be more technical,

1622
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:07,092
like the attractor, is it just the point

1623
01:16:07,226 --> 01:16:09,928
or is it the basin of attraction? But

1624
01:16:10,014 --> 01:16:13,592
broadly on a landscape, as things

1625
01:16:13,646 --> 01:16:17,444
shake out, the attractor begets

1626
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:20,680
some states that are revisited more than

1627
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,476
those that are not. That's kind of the

1628
01:16:22,498 --> 01:16:24,636
tautological definition of the

1629
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:25,950
attracting set.

1630
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,068
An attractor is emphatically not

1631
01:16:33,154 --> 01:16:37,048
at least under standard definition set

1632
01:16:37,074 --> 01:16:39,264
of states that is visited more often.

1633
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:41,920
It is characterized by forward

1634
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,996
invariance. So the fact that once you're

1635
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:46,156
in, you don't get out. So an attractor

1636
01:16:46,188 --> 01:16:49,330
is a manifold so subspace, let us say,

1637
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:52,244
such that if you rain, you get out.

1638
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,224
Well, there is a basin of attraction

1639
01:16:54,272 --> 01:16:56,708
such that if you get in the basin, you

1640
01:16:56,714 --> 01:17:00,664
get into the attractor. So if

1641
01:17:00,702 --> 01:17:04,360
you look at stochastic chemical systems,

1642
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,776
maybe you will get out because a

1643
01:17:06,798 --> 01:17:09,828
stochastic means with random noise

1644
01:17:09,924 --> 01:17:12,616
basically. Let us say that. So if you

1645
01:17:12,638 --> 01:17:14,596
are specifically within a stochastic

1646
01:17:14,628 --> 01:17:16,684
chemical system, so nonical system per

1647
01:17:16,722 --> 01:17:20,872
se, then you can talk of attractor

1648
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:23,052
and think of things that are not

1649
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:25,612
actually that do not have this forward

1650
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:27,996
invariance, just things that you tend to

1651
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,544
stay in for a while once you win. But

1652
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:32,076
you are not talking about attractor

1653
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:33,056
anymore, you are talking about some

1654
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:34,832
other thing. The functional liberty is

1655
01:17:34,886 --> 01:17:36,592
forward invariance, we don't have

1656
01:17:36,646 --> 01:17:39,056
invariance here. So let's not talk of

1657
01:17:39,078 --> 01:17:39,920
attractors.

1658
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,584
We. Shouldn'T fall down this rabbit hole

1659
01:17:45,632 --> 01:17:46,596
completely. We can talk about this

1660
01:17:46,618 --> 01:17:49,976
another time. Let me go to another

1661
01:17:50,078 --> 01:17:51,640
great question. In the chat,

1662
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:56,356
Michael says a philosophical

1663
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:58,888
question. Science does a beautiful job

1664
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,964
of describing and building testable

1665
01:18:01,012 --> 01:18:03,016
predictions of reality, but underweights

1666
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:05,148
subjective experience. Human

1667
01:18:05,234 --> 01:18:08,124
subjectivity arises within experience of

1668
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:10,312
observation, but includes

1669
01:18:10,376 --> 01:18:12,430
preconditioning as well as experience.

1670
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,440
How should science informed observers

1671
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,124
reconcile the limits of subjective

1672
01:18:18,172 --> 01:18:20,336
experience with the limits of

1673
01:18:20,358 --> 01:18:21,280
objectification?

1674
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:27,176
Science build good models. Good models

1675
01:18:27,228 --> 01:18:29,364
are competent engagement. That is

1676
01:18:29,402 --> 01:18:32,804
basically it. So the

1677
01:18:33,002 --> 01:18:34,884
question of how to build a sense that is

1678
01:18:34,922 --> 01:18:36,516
effective to information is basically

1679
01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:39,940
the question that funded Kairos.

1680
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,504
I would not use the word effective per

1681
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,736
se, but that's pretty close.

1682
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:50,520
And we'd have to in principle

1683
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:55,000
sense is built to create precise models.

1684
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,144
Precise as in does not create prediction

1685
01:18:57,192 --> 01:18:59,710
error within a specific context that is

1686
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,060
heavily ritualistic and conservative.

1687
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:07,356
And that would be, you could criticize

1688
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:08,656
pretty heavily the institution of

1689
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:11,740
science as a truth seeker normative

1690
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,610
thing.

1691
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,436
So you'd have to have a good level of

1692
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:22,384
reform to basically enforce modeling

1693
01:19:22,432 --> 01:19:25,332
that are both robust and easy to

1694
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:28,928
transmit socially outside the caste

1695
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:32,088
of scientists. So Danielle and I and

1696
01:19:32,094 --> 01:19:34,250
many other people wrote a paper on

1697
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,440
ontology for decentralized science which

1698
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:45,644
speaks to it. And yeah,

1699
01:19:45,682 --> 01:19:47,756
so if you get science, you get good

1700
01:19:47,778 --> 01:19:49,288
models and once you have good models,

1701
01:19:49,304 --> 01:19:52,748
you can navigate competently. But and I

1702
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,830
don't know but end both,

1703
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,652
you would need heavy level of reform

1704
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:06,592
institution of science to get

1705
01:20:06,646 --> 01:20:09,792
this process be more ergonomic,

1706
01:20:09,856 --> 01:20:12,704
efficient, compelling and socially

1707
01:20:12,752 --> 01:20:15,876
influential. And yeah, I think it's an

1708
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:17,556
important thing to do when I try to do

1709
01:20:17,578 --> 01:20:21,028
it. So thank you for the question. I'll

1710
01:20:21,044 --> 01:20:23,210
give another angle on that.

1711
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:29,460
Bayesian statistics qualitatively

1712
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:33,400
equates to the explicit provisioning

1713
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,972
of our priors and how we update those

1714
01:20:37,026 --> 01:20:39,644
prior beliefs. As new observations come

1715
01:20:39,682 --> 01:20:42,076
in, we may have high attention to new

1716
01:20:42,098 --> 01:20:44,236
observations and update our beliefs a

1717
01:20:44,258 --> 01:20:46,400
lot. We may not be paying to the

1718
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:48,592
attention to the new stimuli and

1719
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:52,252
therefore continue our prior belief.

1720
01:20:52,316 --> 01:20:54,396
So if we're not paying attention, it's

1721
01:20:54,428 --> 01:20:56,720
kind of like a belief with inertia

1722
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,268
that's greater. And if we are paying a

1723
01:20:59,274 --> 01:21:01,492
lot of attention, then beliefs change

1724
01:21:01,546 --> 01:21:05,552
more rapidly and trying to capture

1725
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:08,756
every single belief that

1726
01:21:08,858 --> 01:21:11,464
leads to a research team, whether

1727
01:21:11,502 --> 01:21:14,324
they're in academia or not, to carry

1728
01:21:14,372 --> 01:21:17,524
out, interpret, analyze and communicate

1729
01:21:17,652 --> 01:21:21,272
a certain topic that is

1730
01:21:21,406 --> 01:21:24,220
a really far reaching task.

1731
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,884
However, Bayesian statistics and

1732
01:21:28,002 --> 01:21:29,896
Bayesian approaches like active

1733
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:34,440
inference are helping us get a grasp at

1734
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:38,256
the preconditioning that does

1735
01:21:38,438 --> 01:21:41,596
play an essential role with ongoing

1736
01:21:41,628 --> 01:21:46,016
experience. So the

1737
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:48,016
question of how to engage with extant

1738
01:21:48,048 --> 01:21:52,404
institutions and norms and practices is

1739
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:54,964
a challenging and ongoing work.

1740
01:21:55,162 --> 01:21:58,900
But in some ways the formal principles

1741
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,064
that help us understand how context and

1742
01:22:03,102 --> 01:22:05,172
measurement come together for cognitive

1743
01:22:05,236 --> 01:22:07,716
entities and groups, those fundamental

1744
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:13,340
principles are being communicated.

1745
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,356
Maybe also I'd love to hear about what

1746
01:22:17,378 --> 01:22:19,390
you're planning to talk about.

1747
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,096
Yeah, I'm not sure if I even fully

1748
01:22:25,128 --> 01:22:28,992
understand the question. The question

1749
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:31,696
just briefly I took it to be maybe some

1750
01:22:31,718 --> 01:22:34,736
worry about the relationship between the

1751
01:22:34,758 --> 01:22:36,976
formalisms and computational models in

1752
01:22:36,998 --> 01:22:39,232
active inference and human subjectivity

1753
01:22:39,296 --> 01:22:42,324
itself. So how do they bridge the gap of

1754
01:22:42,362 --> 01:22:45,892
phenomenology there? It's a really

1755
01:22:45,946 --> 01:22:47,348
interesting question. I know that there

1756
01:22:47,354 --> 01:22:48,324
are some people who think that

1757
01:22:48,362 --> 01:22:49,956
phenomenology, human subjective

1758
01:22:49,988 --> 01:22:51,144
experience is just going to have these

1759
01:22:51,182 --> 01:22:53,028
transcendental aspects to it that can't

1760
01:22:53,044 --> 01:22:57,000
be captured by the formalisms.

1761
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,792
That's something I won't be talking

1762
01:22:58,846 --> 01:23:00,280
about in my session.

1763
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,008
What I will be talking about is I'm

1764
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,964
going to speak on some things that did

1765
01:23:10,002 --> 01:23:12,956
come up briefly today. So many of the

1766
01:23:12,978 --> 01:23:16,290
readings that feature in my section are

1767
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,796
readings that will use the term

1768
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:20,416
predictive processing. So I was going to

1769
01:23:20,438 --> 01:23:23,104
say a little bit quite briefly about how

1770
01:23:23,142 --> 01:23:26,204
I think these different, slightly

1771
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:27,876
different frameworks fit together and

1772
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:29,076
what some of the similarities and

1773
01:23:29,098 --> 01:23:32,820
differences are, I was going to say move

1774
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,724
quite quickly and superficially over

1775
01:23:34,762 --> 01:23:37,172
some of the core mechanisms. So

1776
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:38,880
precision, weighting predictions,

1777
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,376
generative models. And then what

1778
01:23:44,398 --> 01:23:47,624
I'm going to try and do is, before we go

1779
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,528
on to the subsequent weeks where we look

1780
01:23:49,534 --> 01:23:50,920
at collective behavior,

1781
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,904
normativity social scripts and things,

1782
01:23:55,022 --> 01:23:57,304
I wanted to try and build up a nicely

1783
01:23:57,352 --> 01:23:59,596
layered picture of what it's like to be

1784
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:02,350
an active inference agent in the world.

1785
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,152
And so the way I'm going to do this is

1786
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:08,364
by swooping over some philosophical

1787
01:24:08,412 --> 01:24:10,096
territory. So I'm going to look at the

1788
01:24:10,118 --> 01:24:13,568
way active inference has said

1789
01:24:13,654 --> 01:24:15,424
interesting things about philosophy of

1790
01:24:15,462 --> 01:24:17,436
mind, particularly in terms of the role

1791
01:24:17,468 --> 01:24:20,964
of internal representation. If I have

1792
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:22,612
time, I'm going to say a little bit

1793
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:24,516
about Embodied cognition, some of the

1794
01:24:24,538 --> 01:24:27,156
four E stuff, aval, you got it right.

1795
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:29,632
So it's Embedded, Embodied, enacted,

1796
01:24:29,696 --> 01:24:31,668
and Extended. And I'm not going to be

1797
01:24:31,674 --> 01:24:33,668
able to talk about all of those, but I'm

1798
01:24:33,684 --> 01:24:34,968
going to say a little bit about some of

1799
01:24:34,974 --> 01:24:37,784
them and how active inference kind of

1800
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,880
brings interest in debates in that area

1801
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,652
out. I'm going to say a little bit about

1802
01:24:42,706 --> 01:24:45,816
folk psychology and motivated action.

1803
01:24:45,928 --> 01:24:50,056
So talking briefly about what agency

1804
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,510
itself is for an active inference agent

1805
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,600
and. Whether psychology folk psychology.

1806
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,300
It'S a kind of propositional psychology.

1807
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,760
So it's a framework of propositions that

1808
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:09,556
we generally use to describe and

1809
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:13,760
explain human behavior. So it involves

1810
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,476
propositions such as A, desires, B,

1811
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:21,224
or X hopes that Y, and it

1812
01:25:21,262 --> 01:25:22,804
turns out that this propositional

1813
01:25:22,852 --> 01:25:26,036
psychology is pretty good for explaining

1814
01:25:26,068 --> 01:25:28,244
and predicting human behavior. But it's

1815
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:30,884
not you say we, it's scientists,

1816
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:34,540
laypersons philosophers.

1817
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,024
So do you mean we in the sense that it's

1818
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:47,116
a useful framework? I mean that you

1819
01:25:47,138 --> 01:25:48,604
should explain what the term is,

1820
01:25:48,642 --> 01:25:51,292
because folk psychology is quite

1821
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,020
specific. It's not a word that is in

1822
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:55,596
folk psychology. Okay, yeah. So folk

1823
01:25:55,628 --> 01:25:57,536
psychology is just basically the

1824
01:25:57,558 --> 01:25:59,772
linguistic framework we use to describe

1825
01:25:59,916 --> 01:26:02,976
human. Say, you know, if I want to

1826
01:26:02,998 --> 01:26:05,648
explain why Avel goes to the

1827
01:26:05,654 --> 01:26:08,196
refrigerator to grab a beer, I would say

1828
01:26:08,298 --> 01:26:10,464
you believe there's beer in the fridge.

1829
01:26:10,512 --> 01:26:12,976
You desire a beer, and then on the basis

1830
01:26:13,008 --> 01:26:15,064
of that, you form the intention to then

1831
01:26:15,102 --> 01:26:19,224
go to the fridge. And it's been the

1832
01:26:19,262 --> 01:26:20,804
subject of a lot of philosophical

1833
01:26:20,852 --> 01:26:23,572
interest because the kind of ontological

1834
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:26,584
status of those concepts is very

1835
01:26:26,622 --> 01:26:29,464
unclear. So it's not clear whether when

1836
01:26:29,502 --> 01:26:31,868
we use folk psychological concepts, are

1837
01:26:31,874 --> 01:26:34,796
we saying that those concepts exist in

1838
01:26:34,818 --> 01:26:37,388
some meaningful way, or should we take a

1839
01:26:37,394 --> 01:26:38,956
more pragmatic approach and say that

1840
01:26:38,978 --> 01:26:41,436
this is just instrumentally useful, but

1841
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,056
we're not actually positing the

1842
01:26:43,078 --> 01:26:45,056
existence of any kind of brain states or

1843
01:26:45,078 --> 01:26:47,456
anything like that. And there's been

1844
01:26:47,478 --> 01:26:49,276
some interesting work on how predictive

1845
01:26:49,308 --> 01:26:50,864
processing and active inference might

1846
01:26:50,902 --> 01:26:54,644
map onto folk psychology. Are they in

1847
01:26:54,682 --> 01:26:56,564
a necessary kind of tension? Because

1848
01:26:56,602 --> 01:26:58,356
obviously with Enactive processing, you

1849
01:26:58,378 --> 01:27:01,876
have just a very limited set of

1850
01:27:01,898 --> 01:27:03,876
primitives with which to describe and

1851
01:27:03,898 --> 01:27:06,568
explain human behavior. So I'm going to

1852
01:27:06,574 --> 01:27:09,716
say a little bit about that and then I'm

1853
01:27:09,748 --> 01:27:11,704
going to move straight into talking

1854
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:13,560
about phenomenology and talking about

1855
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:17,204
how certain aspects of the framework

1856
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:20,160
have been said to underpin certain kinds

1857
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:21,948
of experiences. So I'm going to use a

1858
01:27:21,954 --> 01:27:23,660
case study of addiction, I think

1859
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:26,088
possibly depression, but I think I'm

1860
01:27:26,104 --> 01:27:29,004
going to talk about addiction. And with

1861
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:32,030
this case study, I'm hoping to bring out

1862
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,136
kind of tie together all of the things

1863
01:27:34,178 --> 01:27:35,648
that I've said up to that point and some

1864
01:27:35,654 --> 01:27:36,736
of the things that you've covered as

1865
01:27:36,758 --> 01:27:39,776
well, and I should say as well. In the

1866
01:27:39,798 --> 01:27:42,380
discussion session for my section,

1867
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:44,564
we'll have a special guest as well. So

1868
01:27:44,602 --> 01:27:46,256
we're going to be joined by Professor

1869
01:27:46,288 --> 01:27:49,348
Mark Miller, who is a

1870
01:27:49,434 --> 01:27:52,096
prolific author of predictive processing

1871
01:27:52,128 --> 01:27:54,048
and neurophenomenology type stuff. He's

1872
01:27:54,064 --> 01:27:56,548
done some really interesting work on

1873
01:27:56,714 --> 01:27:59,076
happiness and, wellbeing, depression,

1874
01:27:59,188 --> 01:28:02,276
addiction, and really using the active

1875
01:28:02,308 --> 01:28:04,264
inference framework in some quite

1876
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:08,056
imaginative ways. And he's awesome in

1877
01:28:08,078 --> 01:28:11,404
discussion. So hopefully you will find

1878
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:13,212
the readings for my section really

1879
01:28:13,266 --> 01:28:15,548
interesting. And if you do, you'll have

1880
01:28:15,554 --> 01:28:18,104
a chance to kind of have a conversation

1881
01:28:18,152 --> 01:28:19,980
with the author for those pieces.

1882
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:25,650
Avel. Any closing notes.

1883
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:31,400
Actual inference rules. I will say.

1884
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:36,726
One short question. I just want to get

1885
01:28:36,748 --> 01:28:38,246
it on there while we're here. Brynn

1886
01:28:38,278 --> 01:28:41,466
asks, as a psychologist, I am more or

1887
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:42,954
less in the business of helping people

1888
01:28:42,992 --> 01:28:44,810
minimize their variational free energy

1889
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,102
and expected free energy. Great

1890
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:49,886
profession. But what are the markers of

1891
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,994
free energy in the brain or organism?

1892
01:28:52,122 --> 01:28:54,058
Is it heart rate, neuromodulation,

1893
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:57,706
galvanic skin response,

1894
01:28:57,738 --> 01:29:00,686
cortisol levels, et cetera? I say the

1895
01:29:00,788 --> 01:29:04,542
closest proxy would be those prediction

1896
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:07,826
error things in the brain. So when we

1897
01:29:07,848 --> 01:29:09,502
have expectation and they are violated,

1898
01:29:09,566 --> 01:29:11,960
you have back preparation of this

1899
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,986
information, the fact the expectation

1900
01:29:14,018 --> 01:29:16,470
was violated and this would be the

1901
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:19,986
closest proxy to variational

1902
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:23,366
free energy. I do not

1903
01:29:23,388 --> 01:29:25,578
think it would be the exclusive one,

1904
01:29:25,664 --> 01:29:28,570
but it is the main one.

1905
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,306
And I don't think you could make an

1906
01:29:31,328 --> 01:29:32,986
exhaustive list. Basically anything that

1907
01:29:33,008 --> 01:29:36,346
is out of order so as to prompt any kind

1908
01:29:36,368 --> 01:29:39,614
of response of either updating models or

1909
01:29:39,652 --> 01:29:41,626
facting on things. It would be a marker

1910
01:29:41,658 --> 01:29:45,358
of prediction error, which is not

1911
01:29:45,444 --> 01:29:47,854
quite variational free energy, but is

1912
01:29:47,892 --> 01:29:51,054
also not quite not it.

1913
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:53,360
So for expected free energy,

1914
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,326
I have no idea whatsoever. I don't think

1915
01:29:57,348 --> 01:30:00,634
this framework has made connected

1916
01:30:00,682 --> 01:30:02,680
explicitly to physiology yet.

1917
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:04,870
Am I wrong, Daniel?

1918
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,902
It's a very interesting question, and

1919
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:11,734
all I will say, all I feel like I can

1920
01:30:11,772 --> 01:30:13,558
say on it is one thing we're going to

1921
01:30:13,564 --> 01:30:16,650
talk about in my session, is how

1922
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,402
prediction error is not always a bad

1923
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,894
thing. So there's a really nice Aon

1924
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:23,654
article that came out fairly recently

1925
01:30:23,702 --> 01:30:26,766
about the value of uncertainty. And one

1926
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:28,334
of the things I'm going to talk about is

1927
01:30:28,372 --> 01:30:33,514
how predictive processing has perhaps

1928
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:36,014
it can account for phenomenon such as

1929
01:30:36,132 --> 01:30:38,430
playful behavior, creativity,

1930
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,306
engagement in challenging hobbies and

1931
01:30:42,328 --> 01:30:44,034
dangerous sports and things like this.

1932
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:47,214
And how we get an account of exploratory

1933
01:30:47,262 --> 01:30:49,410
behavior and curiosity, which is kind of

1934
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,254
rooted in the fact that for creatures

1935
01:30:52,302 --> 01:30:54,350
like we are for active inference agents,

1936
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,674
the resolution of prediction error

1937
01:30:56,722 --> 01:31:00,054
itself is a good thing. And so in some

1938
01:31:00,092 --> 01:31:02,278
sense, we're always seeking it out. So I

1939
01:31:02,284 --> 01:31:04,086
think it might be a mistake to kind of

1940
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:06,238
it's very intuitive to equate prediction

1941
01:31:06,274 --> 01:31:07,946
error of free energy with kind of

1942
01:31:07,968 --> 01:31:09,786
allostatic load and stress and

1943
01:31:09,808 --> 01:31:11,578
negativity, but actually it's going to

1944
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,020
turn out that that's not the case.

1945
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:16,638
Yeah. Thank you. And I'll give another

1946
01:31:16,724 --> 01:31:20,074
type of answer, which is variational.

1947
01:31:20,122 --> 01:31:22,942
Free energy and expected free energy are

1948
01:31:22,996 --> 01:31:25,022
statistical calculations about

1949
01:31:25,076 --> 01:31:28,190
statistical models. So bodies don't have

1950
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:31,266
expected free energies. Models that are

1951
01:31:31,288 --> 01:31:34,398
made about bodies can have variational

1952
01:31:34,414 --> 01:31:36,914
and expected free energy. And so to that

1953
01:31:36,952 --> 01:31:40,562
end, whatever you put in your model is

1954
01:31:40,696 --> 01:31:42,642
either an observable or a proposed

1955
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:44,706
latent hidden state that you didn't

1956
01:31:44,738 --> 01:31:48,454
measure. And you may find that different

1957
01:31:48,652 --> 01:31:51,062
experiential reports or different

1958
01:31:51,116 --> 01:31:53,254
physiological phenomena have different

1959
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:55,270
relationships to each other. So indeed,

1960
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,466
it has been explored, for example,

1961
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,846
which neural firing rates are associated

1962
01:31:59,878 --> 01:32:02,890
with surprise or which hormonal changes

1963
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,114
are associated with this or that change

1964
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:08,606
in body temperature when the

1965
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:10,974
generative model is made. The

1966
01:32:11,012 --> 01:32:13,438
deflationary answer is look at the data

1967
01:32:13,524 --> 01:32:16,254
and find out which cues you measure are

1968
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:19,882
associated with your calculation of VFE

1969
01:32:19,946 --> 01:32:22,498
and EFE. However, I think it's a little

1970
01:32:22,504 --> 01:32:25,426
bit of a map territory situation and one

1971
01:32:25,448 --> 01:32:26,642
that's going to come up, I am sure,

1972
01:32:26,696 --> 01:32:28,100
many times in our course.

1973
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:32,374
Great. Well, I'll just remind people to

1974
01:32:32,412 --> 01:32:36,870
go to the course website to review the

1975
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:40,182
syllabus and also encourage everybody to

1976
01:32:40,236 --> 01:32:42,262
submit questions through the course

1977
01:32:42,316 --> 01:32:44,614
website. All of the teachers will review

1978
01:32:44,652 --> 01:32:46,134
the questions and we'll give the best

1979
01:32:46,172 --> 01:32:49,014
answers we can. And also, please, from

1980
01:32:49,052 --> 01:32:51,382
all backgrounds, we would love to hear

1981
01:32:51,436 --> 01:32:54,454
your voice in the discussions. So thank

1982
01:32:54,492 --> 01:32:57,742
you again, Ben and Avel. See you next

1983
01:32:57,796 --> 01:32:58,400
week.
