1
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,660
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,920
it is August 2nd 2023 we're in the

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,079
active inference for the social sciences

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,779
course I'm Daniel Friedman

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,180
and this is going to be a lecture on

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,119
Collective Behavior now of course

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,460
disclaimers could abound and there's so

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,380
many ways to go about this topic of

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,140
collective behavior that in actuality in

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,540
enactments I really hope it is

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,300
multi-scale and Collective I'm really

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,340
looking forward to your comments and

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,559
your engagement with this area with this

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,780
lecture with this course so if you're

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,059
watching live you can add comments into

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,100
the live chat or questions and I'll

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,020
check them out at the end

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,140
also in the YouTube live chat and in the

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,780
video description there is a link to

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,539
where you can submit questions for all

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,180
of the teachers of this course

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,120
that's going to be a coda form and just

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,180
more generally let's have fun enacting

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,920
ecosystems of shared intelligence

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,619
together and I hope that this lecture

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,640
can be something like

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,100
one attempt to make that happen

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
epistemically

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,960
we're gonna have many fun things to talk

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,020
about Collective Behavior what

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,299
differentiates it from Simply Behavior I

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,880
mean aren't all behaving systems

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,880
assemblages is not the brain composed of

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
multiple Parts brain and body multiple

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
people what are we really talking about

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,000
with individual Behavior why do we need

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
adjectives at all for Behavior what is a

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,340
collective and how would we even know it

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,900
except through its Behavior so there's

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,640
gonna be all kinds of fun topics

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,299
Avil provided me with this image and

42
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,159
suggested that it would be a great place

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,920
to head towards and so we can think of

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,899
this as where we're going and where

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,780
we're going is understanding the agents

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,700
or the human

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,179
in a social relationship through social

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,580
action and the recipient of social

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,800
constraints and observations

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,400
through that interface or blanket or

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,560
holographic screen the agent or the

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,920
human is engaging on this socio-cultural

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,599
landscape

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,580
and so we can think about that agents of

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,319
Engagement with the social world and the

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,180
dynamic of socio-cultural constraints

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,940
now that's where we're going and that's

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,800
how someone else has framed where we're

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,760
going

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,860
what I'll tell you here is how we're

61
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,360
getting there how we're getting there

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,580
it's going to be a lot of fun there's

63
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,739
going to be a lot of ants and the door

64
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,739
is going to be wide open so everyone is

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,900
an estimate on this slide and we're

66
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,060
going to be with our regimes of

67
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,879
attention and our stigmergic Trails just

68
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,580
absolutely up down left right all over

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,400
this socio-cultural landscape

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
all right

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,060
so here's the plan for the collective

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,220
Behavior lecture

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,379
it's going to be presented as a sequence

74
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,800
of views each view or perspective is

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,340
gonna consist of at very least a central

76
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,099
citation and then one or more

77
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,640
Reflections on that citation

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,420
or views on Collective Behavior taken as

79
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,420
a bundle will constitute a main section

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,060
of this lecture and there are going to

81
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,040
be three main sections of this lecture

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,099
split on one hand into three groups of

83
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,379
four and on the other hand into two

84
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,420
groups of six

85
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,879
splitting into Force the main three

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,280
sections are going to be background in

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,540
context

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,640
which is going to provide some views and

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,799
insights that are from outside of active

90
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,920
inference because surprise surprise what

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,540
was true before active inference or

92
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,519
outside of active inference is also true

93
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,739
within and after

94
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,060
then we're going to turn to active

95
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,159
inference specifically we're going to

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,379
talk about active inference insights and

97
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,260
fundamentals for Collective behavior and

98
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,260
applications and implications of

99
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,080
utilizing or of conceptualizing of a

100
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,060
social system as an active inference

101
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,320
system

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
so those second two sections are each

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,519
going to center around also specific

104
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,340
recent work in the field

105
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,740
to split it into two groups

106
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,340
of six the first six views that are

107
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,080
presented so all of background and

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,180
context and then half of the insights

109
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,460
and fundamentals are going to be in

110
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,560
support linguistically or rhetorically

111
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,780
of a declarative statement

112
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,060
whereas the latter six

113
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,360
views are going to support or open up to

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,500
a question

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,139
and that'll lead us to the final section

116
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,360
the fourth section which is some open

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,180
questions at that time

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,520
I will look at the live chat and review

119
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,020
any questions or thoughts that people

120
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,139
have and I'll also just open the door

121
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,600
and leave it open with asking questions

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
because that's something that we're

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,460
going to be engaged in for so so long

124
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,380
so let's go right into the first section

125
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,080
background and context

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
here are

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,919
the four views and the four declarative

128
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,840
statements

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,440
big picture many if not all of the

130
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,600
concepts discussions questions and views

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,580
on Collective behavior from before or

132
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,340
outside of active inference also apply

133
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,160
after or inside active inference or in

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,139
the active inference ecosystem

135
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,900
and so to support and to build out that

136
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,699
point I'm going to talk about four

137
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,320
different works and some takeaways first

138
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,600
watching behavior is complex

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,180
here we'll look at Deborah Gordon's 1992

140
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,300
paper wickenstein and ant watching

141
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,880
second all intelligence is collective

142
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,160
intelligence which was a presentation of

143
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,500
the same name by JF cloutcher earlier

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,840
this year referencing a paper of the

145
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,979
same name

146
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,000
third

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,940
we have never been individuals a work by

148
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,880
Gilbert at all from 2012. a symbiotic

149
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,860
view of life we have never been

150
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,560
individuals a little bit of a play on we

151
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,419
have never been modern

152
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,960
and the metaphors and Frameworks and

153
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,060
language that we use to talk about

154
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,560
Behavior to talk about Collective

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
Behavior what adjectives we put in front

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,380
of what nouns that matters and a great

157
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,539
work that Ali shared with me that I

158
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,419
think makes this point super well is by

159
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,979
Navarro and gabriellaitis from 23 and

160
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,720
that work is the morphology of

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
collective intelligence Network swarm

162
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,000
multitude or assemblage

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,699
so let's head straight to Professor

164
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,819
Gordon's 1992 work on wittenstein and

165
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,020
ant watching

166
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,819
and so

167
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,880
just also for a context Professor Gordon

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,699
was my PhD advisor and so I was able to

169
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,860
engage with this material and

170
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,919
perspective through asynchronous means

171
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,000
such as this paper but also seeing it

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,340
actually play out on a socio-cultural

173
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,680
landscape in the desert in southeast

174
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,759
Arizona

175
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,039
that's where the complexity really

176
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,419
flowered

177
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,979
and so

178
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,259
research in animal behavior Begins by

179
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,900
identifying what animals are doing in

180
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,940
the course of observation The Observer

181
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,860
comes to see animals as performing a

182
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,479
particular activity

183
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,240
how does this process work how can we be

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
certain that behavior is identified

185
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,699
correctly

186
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,800
wickenstein offers an approach to these

187
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,539
questions looking at the uses of

188
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:40,680
certainty

189
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,539
rather than attempting to find rules

190
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,479
that guarantee it here two stages in

191
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,039
research are distinguished first

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,039
watching animals and second reporting

193
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,860
the results to other scientists

194
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,660
certainty about what animals are doing

195
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,259
has different uses at each stage and

196
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,780
this is really a beautiful and subtle

197
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,740
point

198
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,780
by distinguishing

199
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,020
stages of the ethological encounter the

200
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,539
behavioral scientific encounter whether

201
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,099
we're talking about ants on the ground

202
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,099
or people in the cities

203
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,639
separating out the observational moments

204
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,240
and the uncertainties that are always at

205
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,440
play there

206
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,199
from this secondary communication about

207
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,500
Behavior at which point having really

208
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,919
clear defined articulations of behavior

209
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,140
becomes so important for scientific

210
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,719
reproducibility Integrity accessibility

211
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,299
and so on

212
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,860
personally I find that this paper

213
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,099
anticipates a lot of the specifications

214
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,980
that today we would consider part of the

215
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,080
metabasian perspective which is to say

216
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,839
we're making inferences as cognitive

217
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,700
systems about other cognitive systems

218
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,860
she wrote my questions about ant

219
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,019
watching do not arise when I'm watching

220
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,200
ants most of the time I do not think

221
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,720
much about certainty when ant watching

222
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,519
replace that for the social human

223
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,160
setting with people watching sometimes

224
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
we're just watching people and that's

225
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
okay that's part of the moment

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
I do not think much about certainty when

227
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,100
ant watching I enact it

228
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,839
the questions do not come from doubts

229
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,180
about the certainty of my seeing but

230
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,740
from the ways that doubts about the

231
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,240
certainty of seeing have shaped

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,980
scientific practice

233
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,899
the resolution of the problem would come

234
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,820
from changes that would allow observers

235
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,500
to talk about what they are actually

236
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,560
doing when watching animals

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,779
truthful accounts of scientific animal

238
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,600
watching don't yet exist

239
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,700
this truth is not yet formed because we

240
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,860
have not yet learned to talk about it

241
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,660
what a wonderful expression

242
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,120
and delightfully I came to see the

243
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,920
confused foragers as patrollers

244
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,260
searching for new food I saw the other

245
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,839
foragers as already decided about their

246
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,820
destination not available to be

247
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,100
distracted by a new source of food and

248
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,600
so we have this really fascinating

249
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,300
dialectic where in the moments we're

250
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,860
observing in this predefinitional space

251
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,779
not questioning though maybe we went to

252
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,459
the field site to ask and answer a

253
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,560
question get data about a question but

254
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,700
in the moment

255
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,519
we're in the flow of observation and not

256
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,220
asking questions though the uncertainty

257
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,339
may be the highest

258
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,140
afterwards when we're communicating to

259
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,360
our scientific colleagues I defined an

260
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,500
outgoing forager as a forger with as an

261
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,980
estimate with no object in the mandibles

262
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,040
and heading off in a straight line

263
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,560
passing a a demarcated point three

264
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,720
meters from The Colony entrance

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,000
then people why three meters why not two

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,040
meters or why can't it be carrying

267
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,519
something on the way out those questions

268
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,380
arise in that precise space of

269
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,700
communication

270
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,440
and

271
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,660
I wanted to open the lecture with this

272
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,680
view because it puts a space between I

273
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,980
see that person putting out a fire

274
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,560
they're a firefighter

275
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,899
in that space between

276
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,000
is the interpretive moment and

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
possibility and reimagining the social

278
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,300
has so much to do with this process of

279
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,440
let's just say ant watching

280
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
second view in this background and

281
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,459
context section

282
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,820
and here I wanted to draw from a

283
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,519
wonderful presentation that JF Cloutier

284
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,220
uh facilitator and participant at the

285
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,860
Active inference Institute presented as

286
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,079
part of his Robotics and embodied

287
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,140
project where yes he's building Lego

288
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,480
robots that do symbolic active inference

289
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,060
but also opening up some great

290
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,880
philosophical directions and ones that

291
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,740
have a lot of implications for how we

292
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,140
think about natural artificial and

293
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,300
synthetic intelligence

294
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,800
this presentation was called all

295
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,480
intelligence is collective intelligence

296
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,339
and it was based upon

297
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,980
the title and drawing upon

298
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,120
uh recent 2022 citation by Fallen days

299
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
at all

300
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,180
and some of these maxims or Expressions

301
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,579
that JF provided

302
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,680
I thought were so provocative

303
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,220
and also brought us back to that initial

304
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,160
question why Collective Behavior I mean

305
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,860
what system isn't a collective so why do

306
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,140
we need the adjective if we're talking

307
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,000
about behaving systems

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,060
what is individual Behavior individual

309
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,160
what oh just one bird oh just one person

310
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,700
okay made up of what

311
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,399
and so JF wrote some expressions and and

312
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,160
you can see from the link and look a

313
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,260
little more with some images and more of

314
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,120
what he wrote but a few of these I

315
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,279
thought were just excellent intelligence

316
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,560
is a process enacted by interacting

317
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,959
parts not a property of individuals

318
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,139
again whatever that would even mean

319
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,180
inaction is death

320
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,220
being by doing

321
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,820
action without prediction is reckless

322
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,519
no prediction without sense making

323
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,040
no sense made without a self versus the

324
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,540
world

325
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,579
or a self in the world

326
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,920
a collective is differently intelligent

327
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,540
than its members

328
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,540
maybe trivially different maybe better

329
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,000
in every way maybe another Direction in

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,360
every way

331
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,660
why do individuals participate in

332
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,380
collectives why are people in groups

333
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,560
because

334
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,700
sacrificing the autonomy to the

335
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
collective provides benefit

336
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,940
survival or even thrival benefits

337
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,300
that's that I to we

338
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,459
no making of sense without the self

339
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,220
acting in or on the world it's not just

340
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,980
some Essence that's disembodied this is

341
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,260
what embodiment is all about

342
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,959
an autonomous agent is a self-organizing

343
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,940
collective of parts

344
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,980
of a collective can themselves be

345
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,959
autonomous agents

346
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,300
collectives form to improve the chance

347
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,339
of survival of their members

348
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,560
and an agent in a collective benefits

349
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,079
from the intelligence of the collective

350
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,459
so

351
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,860
to me this presentation and line of

352
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,220
research pursued by JF and others

353
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,860
absolutely puts a bow on the what is an

354
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,380
individual what is a collective why do

355
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,980
we even talk about quote individuals

356
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,040
or quote collectives when we recognize

357
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,560
the multi-scale nature of complex

358
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,518
adaptive systems

359
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,939
third perspective

360
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,560
a symbiotic view of life we have never

361
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,680
been individuals this is a 2012 paper by

362
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,980
Gilbert Sapp and Talbert

363
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,260
and just to read a few aspects of what

364
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,060
they wrote in the abstract the notion of

365
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,100
the biological individual is crucial to

366
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,199
studies of genetics Immunology Evolution

367
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,079
develop anatomy and physiology

368
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,420
each of these biological sub-disciplines

369
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,639
has a specific conception of

370
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,040
individuality which has historically

371
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,079
provided conceptual context for

372
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,479
integrating newly acquired data

373
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,399
few descriptions

374
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,980
animals cannot be considered individuals

375
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,100
by anatomical or physiological criteria

376
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,100
because a diversity of symbians are both

377
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,899
present and functional in completing

378
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,940
metabolic pathways and serving other

379
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,279
physiological functions

380
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,199
similarly these new Studies have shown

381
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,060
that animal development is incomplete

382
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,160
without symbiance

383
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,440
symbians also constitute a second mode

384
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,480
of genetic inheritance providing

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,459
selectable genetic variation for natural

386
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,540
selection

387
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,519
which connects it to the evolutionary

388
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,279
concept of an individual so if we pursue

389
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,740
the metabolic oh it's it's all the the

390
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,480
metabolic networks and how they're all

391
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,980
connected that's the individual all

392
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,540
right well that includes the microbiome

393
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,339
and symbionts we'll know it's the

394
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,320
physiology and the decision making and

395
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,779
the neurophysiology those are also in

396
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,820
play with the symbiance well at least

397
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,180
Evolution only selects upon the germline

398
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,579
right well no actually there are these

399
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,380
multiple mechanisms of inheritance

400
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,480
whether they're relevant in a given

401
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,079
situation or not is situational but in

402
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,120
principle they exist and they're

403
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,220
increasingly coming to be recognized

404
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,959
additionally for the immune system

405
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
commonly described as quote self versus

406
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,540
non-self or self-identification or

407
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,940
self-other discrimination after all we

408
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,980
talk about Auto grafting and

409
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,380
allografting but of course there are

410
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,740
aspects of quote self or self under some

411
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,220
definitions like an epitope from a

412
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,459
protein in cartilage than an autoimmune

413
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,540
disorder

414
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,880
might Target so the immune system is

415
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,339
mobilized against self

416
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,099
under some definitions sometime and is

417
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,919
not mobilized against other under some

418
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,919
definitions sometimes like we're not

419
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,980
constantly mounting uh massive immune

420
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,319
response to our gut microbiome or skin

421
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,299
microbiome

422
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,000
recognizing the holobiant the

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,220
multicellular eukaryote plus its

424
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,559
colonies of persistent symbiance as a

425
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,179
critically important unit of anatomy

426
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,039
development physiology immunology and

427
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,440
evolution and cognition

428
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,140
opens up a new investigative Avenue and

429
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,000
conceptually challenges the ways in

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,039
which the biological sub-disciplines

431
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,620
have heretofore characterized living

432
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,740
entities here we have the cover of the

433
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,200
famous work Leviathan it's a large

434
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,960
person constituted of other people

435
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,660
really making the point clear but if we

436
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,120
zoomed in on quote an individual person

437
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,460
wouldn't we find something like

438
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,220
societies of cells

439
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,280
what is an individual when is an

440
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,039
individual what

441
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,860
and what's on the line

442
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,140
I thought those are such big questions

443
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,539
maybe could we connect it to a little

444
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,179
bit of more of a bibliographic piece of

445
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,640
data just to show a snapshot and to open

446
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,160
up this discussion to you all

447
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,980
about what's on the line with what's an

448
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,240
individual

449
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,880
and so what I did is I I searched for

450
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,340
some literature Trends on PubMed

451
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,620
and here is the results per 100 000

452
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,840
citations for Collective Behavior

453
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,179
and so we see Collective Behavior first

454
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,520
being mentioned in the 1950s at least in

455
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
this literature database and rising up

456
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,480
on through around 500 or 400 or 500 per

457
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,460
hundred thousand so a thousand out of a

458
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,799
hundred thousand would be one percent so

459
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,960
half of a percent

460
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,200
of all the citations on a major biolytic

461
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,460
literature

462
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,320
um database

463
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,020
had Collective behavior in them so

464
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,700
that's that's a huge amount of work and

465
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,160
it looks like it goes down but when you

466
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,299
actually look at how many citations

467
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,039
there are it's been about four to five

468
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,380
thousand Publications per year

469
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,419
it's just that the rest of the

470
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,280
literature database may be expanding at

471
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,679
a faster rate so thousands of paper per

472
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,200
year in an appreciable fraction of work

473
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,840
has to do with Collective behavior and

474
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
so I thought wow that that that's that's

475
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,679
exciting that's great well how are we

476
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,600
doing compared to behavior

477
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,880
now Collective behavior is this lower

478
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,600
line in red and yeah there's a blip but

479
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,620
behavior is up between 15 and 20 percent

480
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,320
of citations in PubMed

481
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,160
now maybe behavior is also referring to

482
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,380
the behavior of a given material that

483
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,480
may or may not be a superconductor or

484
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,340
might be using different understandings

485
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,200
of behavior

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,980
um

487
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,500
but what what can we say and what can we

488
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,260
know about the difference between

489
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,900
individual and Collective Behavior

490
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,320
now interestingly here I searched for

491
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,960
individual Behavior as a specific term

492
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,539
so we see a lot lower but individual

493
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,160
Behavior

494
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,280
I mean can the tide have already turned

495
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,380
can it really be the case that after

496
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,860
2020 this is a real meaningful decline I

497
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,020
don't know it's too early to say we

498
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,760
can't do technical analysis just like

499
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,419
that but very provocative and gives us

500
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,220
some ways to look at the broader scale

501
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,620
or Collective scientific cognitive

502
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,840
process associated with these incredibly

503
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,120
important philosophical and and

504
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,220
biological questions about individuality

505
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,840
because of course to distinguish

506
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,820
Collective behavior from Individual

507
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,860
Behavior or why will you why would you

508
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,200
even need an adjective at all it's going

509
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,640
to come down to what is an individual

510
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,059
and what's on the line so much

511
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,580
in the last view here

512
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,400
drawing upon the work morphology of

513
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
collective intelligence Network swarm

514
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,900
multitude or assemblage and Tony Navarro

515
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,799
and Alejandra Lopez gabrieladis wrote

516
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,740
Network swarm and multitude are some of

517
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,940
the different metaphors that have been

518
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,380
used to understand the concept of

519
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,539
collective intelligence all of them have

520
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,919
reflected our relationship with the

521
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,440
internet and its development

522
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,059
with the Advent of artificial

523
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,020
intelligence AI

524
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,580
we wonder about other metaphors that

525
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,140
might offer a new understanding of

526
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,940
collective intelligence

527
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,740
to address today's environmental and

528
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,860
socio-technical challenges

529
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,780
they bring up Network swarm and

530
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,720
multitude to advocate for the fourth

531
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,880
option assemblage

532
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,620
understanding collective intelligence as

533
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,720
an assemblage allows for the inclusion

534
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,760
of different human and technological

535
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,340
agents and overcomes the antipocentrism

536
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,559
human centrism

537
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,620
human exclusionism of other models based

538
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,140
on human will whether extended as in the

539
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,539
multitude or suppressed as in the Swarm

540
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,820
connotations here

541
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,679
in this way ethical decision making and

542
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,140
responsibility are distributed among

543
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,880
different cognitive actors with a

544
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,100
capacity to choose and interpret

545
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,840
and to the extent that they make

546
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
decisions albeit algorithmic ones they

547
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,280
are also accountable and I love this and

548
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,080
I think it foreshadows where we're going

549
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,240
to be going with active inference which

550
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,159
is

551
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,200
different cognitive actors have the

552
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,240
capacity to choose and interpret we

553
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,400
might connect that to sensory and

554
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
internal states of an active inference

555
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,080
agent but perception sense making signal

556
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,200
processing inbound information

557
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,020
and decision making and responsibility

558
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,700
and accountability

559
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,740
and the accountability that we associate

560
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,900
with human socio-technical systems

561
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,120
that's the action selection control

562
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,640
theory outgoing dependencies in the

563
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,580
Markov blanket so right there coming

564
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,340
from outside of active inference we see

565
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,280
the identification of the need to have

566
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,679
flexible Frameworks including linguistic

567
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,940
and metaphorical

568
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,159
that allow us to talk about

569
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,400
heterogeneous diverse cyber physical

570
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,760
systems where different entities are

571
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,640
engaged in different practices and ways

572
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,299
of incoming sense making and outgoing

573
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,940
decision making and it's going to turn

574
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,220
out that active inference is an

575
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,380
incredible and flexible expressive

576
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,659
framework that's going to allow us to

577
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,919
talk about those kinds of systems

578
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,240
pointed to here

579
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,460
and it really matters they point to some

580
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
of the most important aspects of issues

581
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,559
today

582
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,020
on to active inference insights and

583
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,120
fundamentals well here as in all the

584
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
other areas there are so many pieces of

585
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,799
literature that could have been drawn on

586
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,020
that's why I restricted myself to just

587
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,158
four views

588
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,440
also this section is going to Mark the

589
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,120
Midway point we're not there yet don't

590
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,799
worry but the Midway point of the

591
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,780
lecture where we move from the six

592
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,179
declarative expressions

593
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,640
on to the questions because it's more

594
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,620
open than not and there's more space for

595
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,539
you to respond than you may imagine

596
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,720
but what are the views going to be here

597
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,919
and what are the literature that support

598
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,940
that point

599
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,520
so first active inference in the free

600
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,500
energy principle which is a principle

601
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,600
that provides a lot of

602
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,000
theoretical grounding and physics-based

603
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,799
perspective on active inference but

604
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,940
we're not going to go too much into it

605
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,960
today

606
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,220
active inference in the free energy

607
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,559
principle are scale free formalisms for

608
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
cognitive systems

609
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,539
with collectives as with individuals the

610
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,580
general framing in itself does very

611
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,480
little

612
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,340
however with properly constructed

613
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,320
generative models we can get explanation

614
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,120
prediction design influence and

615
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,220
implementation tools and here I'm going

616
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,760
to draw on two pieces of work epistemic

617
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,039
communities under active inference by

618
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,820
Mao and colleagues in 2022 and just from

619
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,679
several days ago the work by Connor

620
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,419
Hines and colleagues collected behavior

621
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,120
from Surprise minimization

622
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,799
we'll unpack the point more when we get

623
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,640
there

624
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,679
second collectives can be understood of

625
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,480
consisting

626
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
as consisting of action perception Loops

627
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,000
which subsume in tail or supervene upon

628
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,640
individual level action perception loops

629
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,620
Niche modification

630
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,039
stigmergy can also be modeled this way

631
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,559
we'll draw upon the paper octave in

632
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
France an active inference framework for

633
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,640
ant colony Behavior by myself and

634
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,919
colleagues in 2021

635
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,600
and then we'll move into the questions

636
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,880
and things will start to open up so if

637
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,200
it feels like we've been climbing uphill

638
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,760
we're two-thirds of the way with the

639
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,320
uphill climb feels like we've been going

640
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,400
downhill

641
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,860
we're together just away with a downhill

642
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,020
how do the concepts of generalized

643
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,360
synchrony and homeostasis which are so

644
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,460
core to active inference relate to

645
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,900
Collective Behavior

646
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,240
here we'll discuss the work by RAF

647
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,940
Kaufman at all from 2021 an active

648
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,140
inference model of collective

649
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,400
intelligence

650
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,799
and lastly in this section how can

651
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,840
active inference be used to explore the

652
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,520
balance between individual and

653
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,720
Collective behaviors and the

654
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,640
bi-directional influence of collectives

655
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,820
on individuals and of course vice versa

656
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,039
here we'll draw upon the computational

657
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,140
boundary of a self developmental

658
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,419
bioelectricity drives multicellularity

659
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,700
and scale free cognition by Mike Levin

660
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,100
in 2019.

661
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,320
so let's get right into the work by Mal

662
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,500
and Connor and colleagues

663
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,840
first I'm just going to bring this paper

664
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,020
up however first

665
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,299
you can watch more about it in guest

666
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,260
stream 17.1 from March 2022 here's two

667
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,240
two collectives right here

668
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,179
and also Mao will be covering this work

669
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,640
in a lot more detail later on in the

670
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,720
course I just wanted to bring it up

671
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,740
because I think it's one of the

672
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,659
exceptional examples

673
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,179
that can be deployed to show like hey

674
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,580
just thinking about the social as an

675
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,220
active inference system is awesome it's

676
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,679
an intuition pump it brings us into the

677
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,419
active inference ecosystem but then what

678
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,580
do we do when we're there and what we do

679
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,380
when we're there is we develop

680
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,940
generative models that actually take us

681
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,520
towards where we want to be

682
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,140
again

683
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,559
framing a situation as being related to

684
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,820
active inference or you could do an

685
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,640
active inference model of that does very

686
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,179
very little work by itself however

687
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,460
making generative models of situations

688
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,500
even if they're speculative generative

689
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,020
models or qualitative or hypothetical

690
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,720
that can start getting towards doing

691
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,059
work but if someone said well that

692
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,500
health condition you could do a linear

693
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,760
regression

694
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,400
okay but which treatment do we do well

695
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,539
it could be done with a linear

696
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,980
regression we could use a linear

697
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,419
regression to figure out what what

698
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,600
method to use okay but you know more or

699
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,880
less hotter room or colder room well

700
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,679
just use a linear regression

701
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,419
so that's the conversation that we're

702
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,820
having a lot with active inference a lot

703
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,960
of times people are talking about

704
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,299
whether a given situation can or cannot

705
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,640
be modeled with active inference or just

706
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,380
in the abstract what does active

707
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,659
inference say about this situation and

708
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,179
again the framework itself is generals

709
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,760
the point of doing little work and we

710
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,059
love it that way it enables us to move

711
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,880
into systems of interest and deploy

712
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,919
generative models so what they did in

713
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,080
this paper was leverage the active

714
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,059
inference framework to provide an

715
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,039
in-silico model on the computer chip

716
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,419
model

717
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,880
of confirmation bias and its effect on

718
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,220
Echo chamber formation they had a system

719
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,500
of Interest people's social engagement

720
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,080
on so-called social media and they had

721
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,880
even a phenomena of Interest which was

722
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,100
Echo chamber formation

723
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,659
they built a model based on active

724
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,520
inference where agents tend to sample

725
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,799
information in order to justify their

726
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,840
own view of reality something we call

727
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,460
self-evidising

728
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,559
we show that once agents have reached a

729
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,120
certain level of certainty about their

730
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,100
beliefs it becomes very difficult to get

731
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,440
them to change their views

732
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,960
the system of self-confirming beliefs is

733
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
upheld and reinforced by the evolving

734
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
relationship between an agent's beliefs

735
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,120
and observations

736
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,760
which will over time will continue to

737
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,559
provide evidence for their ingrained

738
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,299
ideas about the world

739
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,000
well where I'm from we drive on the

740
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,220
right side of the road and so you drive

741
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,720
on the right side of the road I drive on

742
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,919
the right side of the road we're not

743
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,840
going to have an issue everywhere I look

744
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,760
I see cars moving around I see people

745
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,380
passing on the right on the sidewalk

746
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,480
it's all making sense we're bounding

747
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,399
surprise we're doing active inference

748
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,279
surprisal minimization goals reward

749
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,799
never need to come into play to give an

750
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,860
account of how those systems could arise

751
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,860
and be stabilized

752
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,260
these epistemic communities are

753
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,899
Consolidated by those shared beliefs and

754
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,760
in turn tend to produce perceptions of

755
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,279
reality that reinforce those shared

756
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,940
beliefs and on the top right is just a

757
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,820
little teaser of what a Bayesian

758
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,399
graphical model looks like of the kind

759
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,678
that they deployed in this paper

760
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,980
and here we see some of the results from

761
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,140
their parameter sweeping exploring

762
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,600
different combinations of parameters and

763
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,520
looking at topics like polarization

764
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,640
index and re-attendance rate

765
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,240
and so all kinds of Statistics that can

766
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,279
be drawn upon connected to the

767
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,159
generative model and also all kinds of

768
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,580
opportunities and interfaces to relate

769
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,860
this to empirical data

770
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,200
as well as suggested experiments so Mal

771
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,640
is going to talk more about this and

772
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,760
it's awesome work and then late breaking

773
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,659
news

774
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,240
only several days ago five or so days

775
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,140
ago

776
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,720
an amazing new preprint was put up by

777
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,480
Connor Hines and colleagues and it was

778
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
just too cool not to include here and

779
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,580
reflects the very rapid pace of

780
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,440
collaborative development in the active

781
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,600
inference ecosystem and this is their

782
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,399
work Collective behavior from Surprise

783
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:12,840
minimization

784
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,179
and they made every point I wanted to

785
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,360
make Here and Now

786
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,399
Collective motion is ubiquitous in

787
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,600
nature

788
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,360
typically such macroscopic patterns

789
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,980
arise from decentralized local

790
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,080
interactions among constituent

791
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,159
components

792
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,799
EG individual fish in a school

793
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,559
there's that word individual again

794
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,360
preeminent models of this process

795
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,179
describe individuals as self-propelled

796
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,159
particles subject to self-generated

797
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,500
motion and social forces such as

798
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,480
short-range repulsion and long-range

799
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,600
attraction or alignment hmm

800
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,840
however organisms are not particles

801
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,899
they are probabilistic decision makers

802
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,299
they're cognitive particles

803
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,340
we introduce an approach to modeling

804
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,720
Collective Behavior based on active

805
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,740
inference

806
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,500
this cognitive framework casts Behavior

807
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,299
as the consequence of a single

808
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,360
imperative to minimize surprise

809
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,820
again if you want to you can contrast

810
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,580
that with reward learning where the

811
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,860
imperative is to maximize reward

812
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,539
inactive inference and the free energy

813
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,120
principle we're taking a path of least

814
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,820
action not the laziest path or the most

815
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,860
passive one but a little bit more

816
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,399
technically a path of least action

817
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,260
and we're minimizing surprise we're

818
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,940
bounding surprise with variational free

819
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,039
energy and it turns out that that helps

820
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,380
us minimize surprise and maximize model

821
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,480
evidence and it can include things like

822
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,820
novelty and curiosity seeking very

823
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,200
naturally so this doesn't mean we're

824
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,460
squeezing the juice out of life at all

825
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,559
we demonstrate that many empirically

826
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,960
observed Collective phenomena including

827
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,179
cohesion milling and directed motion

828
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,799
emerge naturally when considering

829
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,840
Behavior as driven by active Bayesian

830
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,779
inference without explicitly building

831
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,880
behavioral rules or goals into

832
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
individual agents

833
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,760
no reward no goal

834
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,159
no master of the collective

835
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,140
furthermore we show that active

836
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,940
inference can recover and generalize the

837
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,220
classical notion of social forces as

838
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,140
agents attempt to suppress prediction

839
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,179
errors that conflict with their

840
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,559
expectations

841
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,240
by exploring the parameter space of the

842
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,220
belief-based model we reveal non-trivial

843
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,659
relationships between the individual

844
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,460
beliefs and group properties like

845
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,559
polarization

846
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,240
and the tendency to visit different

847
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,559
Collective States

848
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
we also explore

849
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
how individual beliefs about uncertainty

850
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,480
metacognition beliefs about beliefs

851
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,679
determine Collective decision-making

852
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,419
accuracy

853
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,519
what if when you voted or shared your

854
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,779
perspective on what we were going to

855
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,179
have for dinner you also conveyed an

856
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,460
uncertainty estimate how confident are

857
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,200
you about that being the case

858
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,940
finally we show how agents can update

859
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,260
their generative model over time

860
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,760
resulting in groups that are

861
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,220
collectively more sensitive to external

862
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,320
fluctuations and encode information more

863
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,520
robustly

864
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,679
from a distributed systems perspective

865
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,199
you can imagine two different kinds of

866
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,780
distributed systems or networks one of

867
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,320
them has a dampening like quality so

868
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,280
something that enters on one side

869
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,320
dampens as it diffuses

870
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,300
we can also contrast that with another

871
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,679
kind of distributed system or another

872
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,480
kind of input or stimulus or context

873
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,280
that amplifies and the goal or one nice

874
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,020
property to have a systems would be like

875
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,899
we want to dampen what we don't want to

876
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,179
pay attention to and

877
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,599
up signal or increase the cascading

878
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,460
availability of what we do want to

879
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,859
attend to now that's a little circular

880
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:50,940
since in some ways that's the definition

881
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,359
of attention however making unified

882
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,240
models like they do here gives us

883
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,980
integrated approaches to explore a broad

884
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,280
range of collective phenomena here in

885
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
spatial movement but also involving the

886
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
cognitive states of the particles and

887
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,460
they make a really nice representation

888
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,280
here to connect to other approaches

889
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,200
a traditional approach to classical

890
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,359
self-propelled particles is Agent

891
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,359
environment agents take rules

892
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,040
and they make decisions based upon those

893
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,740
rules that are either given or learned

894
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,960
you know when you're this close to the

895
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,700
bird next to you do that and when you're

896
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,280
this close do this and then social

897
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,560
forces of these kind of as if or actual

898
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,380
constraints that then modify the agent's

899
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,900
perspective and what we see in the

900
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,000
active inference setting is that the

901
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,420
agent in the environment are mediated by

902
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,040
an interface

903
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,920
the Markov blanket this is the sensorium

904
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,099
this is on the inbound side perception

905
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,940
and on the outbound side action

906
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,800
and they give some more details it's a

907
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,780
really exciting paper and it's just cool

908
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,460
to see again that even in the the

909
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,500
Preparatory days of a lecture like this

910
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,140
like there's always new Collective

911
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,180
activity in the ecosystem and that's

912
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,779
what makes it fun

913
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,220
last of the declarative sections of this

914
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,359
lecture

915
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,859
colonies

916
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:26,099
here but more generally collectives can

917
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,960
be understood as consisting of action

918
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,240
perception Loops which subsume in tail

919
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,460
or supervene upon individual level

920
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,619
action perception loops

921
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,380
Niche modifications or stigmergy can

922
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,859
also be modeled this way

923
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:43,740
what we did in this paper was

924
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,599
bring something new to active inference

925
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,940
in at least two different ways

926
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,119
first it was the it was the first model

927
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,540
of an ant's system of Interest now for

928
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,280
some of us mere mycologists in the

929
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,619
audience all of our broader entomology

930
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,260
colleagues that may be enough but what

931
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,119
was also really interesting about this

932
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,220
work and the opportunity to collaborate

933
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,320
on it was it was the first active

934
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,440
inference model presented with explicit

935
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,839
stigmergy not just the philosophical

936
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,780
consideration of the traces that agents

937
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,960
leaving in the environment might then

938
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,520
um have them change their behavior in

939
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,160
the future but but explicitly engaging

940
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,440
with this process of multi-agent

941
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,760
stigmergic behavior

942
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,720
active inference may be informative in

943
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,339
the study of ant colonies at three

944
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,980
distinct temporal scales nestmate

945
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,380
Behavior which is to say emergent among

946
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,359
tissues of anesthemate

947
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,859
you could keep on going collectively

948
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,760
down

949
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,740
and interactions with the biotic or

950
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,320
abiotic environment so first level at

951
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,540
the level of an estimate one of those

952
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,520
things with six legs that looks like an

953
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,839
insect

954
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,359
at the level of the colony

955
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,760
Colony development is emergence among

956
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,440
nestmates and their interactions with

957
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,960
the niche that is where many people

958
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,940
would traditionally assign Collective

959
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,920
Behavior they said well well one

960
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,260
estimate walking around is individual

961
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,900
Behavior that's the individual ants and

962
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,700
then the colony is where Collective

963
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,619
Behavior comes into play right and we're

964
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,560
going to see that reified very soon

965
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,960
but lastly we point to the evolution of

966
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,820
populations which is an emergent outcome

967
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,760
amongst colonies within an ecology

968
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,040
in this work we focused on the

969
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,420
connection between the first two levels

970
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,920
of analysis

971
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,839
focusing on the case of stigmergic

972
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,660
colony foraging using a modification of

973
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,220
previous active inference computational

974
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,020
implementations

975
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,680
we didn't use the word individual and

976
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,800
there's a reason why because

977
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,200
we're saying what we mean more clearly

978
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,020
when talking about ants when we talk

979
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,780
about Nest mates colonies and

980
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,880
populations of colonies

981
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,400
that side steps or transcends the

982
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,200
discussion of what is an individual and

983
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,579
what is a collective because with

984
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,320
respect to the Colony as an individual

985
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,540
if you want to use that word the

986
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,160
population is a collective with respect

987
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,839
to the nest main the colony is a

988
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,320
collective with respect to the tissue

989
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,780
like the brain or the mid gut the

990
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,599
nestomy is a collective so we don't need

991
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,060
to play the adjective game we can just

992
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,800
articulate what we're interested in

993
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,200
about these systems of interest and

994
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,020
complex adaptive system phenomena

995
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,359
and so what we did was we explored a

996
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,280
kind of classical behavioral setting

997
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,000
which is food being placed between the

998
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,460
arms of a teammates and in this case

999
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,660
rather than a rat

1000
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,400
I'm just pausing for a second while I

1001
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,119
believe that my

1002
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,220
internet is reconnecting and we should

1003
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,578
be back

1004
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,540
each ant

1005
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,240
was described by an action perception

1006
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,339
Loop an active inference action

1007
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,680
perception Loop and they were able to

1008
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,440
move within a three by three grid

1009
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,780
as well as perceive pheromone density

1010
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,119
within a three by three grid and then

1011
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,579
they laid down pheromone they added

1012
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,060
stigmergic trace on the way home if they

1013
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,060
had found a seed and so this does a few

1014
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,000
interesting things and and live stream

1015
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,680
29 is where we unpack this a lot more

1016
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,300
but I just wanted to make two more

1017
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,880
points here the first is that in a

1018
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,520
reward Centric perspective on AMP

1019
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,420
Behavior

1020
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,500
the pheromone is seen as a semiotic cue

1021
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,660
and the seed or the food is seen as the

1022
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,000
reward and so then we got to use the

1023
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,320
cues we've got to use the pheromone

1024
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,880
density to like figure out where the

1025
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,760
good stuff is that's that paradigm

1026
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,040
we flipped that with active inference

1027
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,040
now the preference we don't need to say

1028
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,140
reward but the preference that which is

1029
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,420
sought after

1030
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,220
proximally but teleologically

1031
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,099
that which is sought after preferred

1032
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,859
over is the pheromone

1033
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,400
the seed becomes the semiotic cue that

1034
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,960
it's time to turn on your pheromone

1035
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,359
depositing and come home

1036
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,020
and so that blips our approach to

1037
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,440
understanding what foraging is about

1038
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,079
from we're lost in the sauce trying to

1039
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,460
figure out where the good thing is out

1040
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,400
there to we're surfing the hundred foot

1041
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,660
wave

1042
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,460
and we'll know it when we see it and

1043
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,260
then we'll turn around

1044
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,119
very different perspective and then one

1045
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,339
other point that I had to make for the

1046
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,280
context was that we used a modification

1047
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,900
of a previous active inference

1048
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,079
computational implementation what was

1049
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,980
the the paper that we drew from

1050
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,200
in fact it was the acquisition of

1051
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,060
culturally patterned attention Styles

1052
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,180
under active inference with Axel and

1053
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,740
Alex at all

1054
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,720
and what this paper did

1055
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,420
was they looked at the situation of

1056
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,079
visual foraging

1057
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,640
on avas a piece of pottery

1058
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,040
where the eye was only able to perceive

1059
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,660
a three by three Matrix of pixels

1060
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,619
and then the I scanned around looking to

1061
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,660
recognize broader patterns that were

1062
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,660
then culturally acquired so maybe one

1063
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,119
culture or one subculture likes the

1064
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,220
checkerboard pattern and another one

1065
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,839
likes vertical lines another one likes

1066
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,880
horizontal lines or these other kinds of

1067
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,300
repetitive structures

1068
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,720
what's so interesting is that the I when

1069
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,820
it is foraging

1070
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,280
does not leave a trace though it can

1071
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,800
feel like it doesn't it but the eye

1072
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,720
Forge is around

1073
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,940
in order to get the bigger picture

1074
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,339
based on local information

1075
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,619
what we did is we said well instead of

1076
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,480
imagining that as the Gaze location of

1077
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,619
an eye

1078
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,140
let's imagine that as the skin in the

1079
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,200
game exoskeleton on the ground of a

1080
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,400
forager

1081
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,619
so let's think about that movement

1082
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,839
as something that an embodied forager

1083
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,180
does with its real body

1084
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,880
and then conditional in this setting

1085
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,180
upon it touching the seed or the food it

1086
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,160
can lay down a pheromone Trail which the

1087
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,800
eyes can't do per se

1088
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,240
and so just really interesting because

1089
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,720
it's not like this was an ant paper and

1090
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,220
now we're going to try to cram it into

1091
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,619
social sciences it's actually like

1092
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,020
computational work in the social

1093
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,460
sciences

1094
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,280
was able to translate to miracology into

1095
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,780
ants research

1096
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,520
and so it's a very fruitful and

1097
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,800
bi-directional relationship between

1098
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,720
studying ants and studying people

1099
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,920
now we're going to move into the

1100
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,140
openness of questions in this second

1101
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,180
half of the lecture

1102
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,940
so how do the concepts of generalized

1103
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,920
synchrony and homeostasis which are core

1104
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,660
to active inference relate to Collective

1105
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,560
Behavior

1106
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,380
and here we can draw upon the work by

1107
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,660
RAF Kaufman pranav Gupta and Jacob

1108
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,300
Taylor from 2021 called inactive

1109
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,740
inference model of collective

1110
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,599
intelligence and this was also unpacked

1111
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,480
in guest stream nine and so here's a

1112
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,819
little Collective over here and that was

1113
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,579
about two years ago

1114
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,420
way back when

1115
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,619
what they did in this paper was they

1116
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,740
considered a setting with two trolley

1117
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,480
cars

1118
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,839
moving around a wheel

1119
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,400
and so here's how they contextualize

1120
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,420
that work

1121
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,160
formal models of collective intelligence

1122
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,720
have lacked a plausible mathematical

1123
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,400
description of the relationship between

1124
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,440
local scale interactions between

1125
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,420
autonomous subsystem components

1126
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,400
individuals

1127
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,440
and global scale behavior of the

1128
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,420
composite system the collective

1129
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,940
so they do a really great job faking out

1130
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,160
what they mean by individual and

1131
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,720
Collective

1132
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,339
in this paper we use the active

1133
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,220
inference formulation aif

1134
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,260
a framework for explaining the behavior

1135
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,060
of any non-equilibrium steady-state

1136
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,599
system at any scale to posit a minimal

1137
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,160
agent-based model that simulates the

1138
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,319
relationship between local individual

1139
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:08,760
level interaction and collective

1140
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,380
intelligence

1141
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,440
then they had a really creative approach

1142
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,660
to disentangling how different

1143
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,640
capacities

1144
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,440
translated to different Collective

1145
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,720
outcomes and here's what they did

1146
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,940
we explore the effects of providing

1147
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,420
Baseline active inference agents model 1

1148
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,140
with specific cognitive capabilities

1149
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,460
model 2 added in a theory of Minds

1150
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,819
model 3 added in goal alignment

1151
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,760
and model 4 added both theory of mind

1152
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,740
and goal alignment

1153
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,020
what does that look like again we're not

1154
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,099
going to go into all the technical

1155
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,380
details here but broadly this is what it

1156
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,599
looked like here was their simplest

1157
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,700
Baseline active inference formulation

1158
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,960
case

1159
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,980
and then in the subsequent experiments

1160
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,440
they added in either one or the other or

1161
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,180
both of the cognitive capacities that

1162
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,040
they described

1163
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,760
they studied the single

1164
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,520
dyad case and they very cleverly

1165
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,180
expanded that into a large scale

1166
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,859
multi-diad case

1167
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,560
they

1168
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,680
utilized their own representation of the

1169
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,319
active inference partition

1170
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,380
in order to facilitate the construction

1171
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,200
of this model and so in this case we see

1172
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,460
the blanket with the sensory States

1173
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,560
coming in the active States going out

1174
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,700
Markov blanket

1175
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
here we see the environment

1176
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,300
and then internal belief States or

1177
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,400
cognitive States

1178
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,660
so

1179
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,880
very cool work

1180
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,920
that helps us

1181
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,520
get a vocabulary around not shut the

1182
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,200
book on

1183
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,119
but focus on

1184
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,480
how how do different Agents come to

1185
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,119
synchronize what is generalized

1186
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,160
synchrony well it doesn't mean lockstep

1187
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,040
turn taking is generalized synchron

1188
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,619
because these two agents the time that

1189
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,260
they're talking has very high Mutual

1190
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,599
information on the other

1191
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,180
even though the correlation with their

1192
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,740
speaking might be negative

1193
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,780
agent a is speaking when B is not and

1194
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,900
vice versa so from a linear regression

1195
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,400
perspective there's a negative

1196
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,560
correlation but from a mutual

1197
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,560
information perspective where you can't

1198
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,920
ever have below zero information at

1199
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,740
worst it's just noise

1200
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,280
you always have zero or positive amount

1201
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,040
of information of systems about other

1202
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,920
systems and so that opens the door to

1203
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,140
understanding generalized synchrony

1204
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,660
which is a broader conception of how

1205
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,940
individuals in collectives

1206
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,560
are interacting

1207
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,240
and homeostasis maybe we could even

1208
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,119
imagine that these are multiple cells in

1209
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,500
the pancreas and they're trying to

1210
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,440
coordinate on insulin sensitivity or

1211
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,780
maybe this is multiple people who are

1212
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,119
securing the defense of a community and

1213
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:13,200
they also need to coordinate

1214
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,780
synchronously and asynchronously and so

1215
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,319
there's a lot of ways in which this very

1216
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,319
very lightweight apparatus of the active

1217
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,000
inference partition

1218
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,480
helps us bring together and compose all

1219
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,520
these cool what-ifs well what if it had

1220
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,680
theory of mind what if it had goal

1221
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,960
alignment what if agents had theory of

1222
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,660
mind and goal alignment and what if we

1223
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,359
put them in a in a five by seven grid

1224
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,780
and then we did this and and and ants

1225
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,940
that's what we get to do with active

1226
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,200
inference

1227
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,660
and lastly here

1228
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,760
how can active inference be used to

1229
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,560
explore the balance between individual

1230
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,420
and Collective Behavior and the

1231
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,520
bi-directional influence of collectives

1232
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,900
on individuals

1233
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,319
and so here I draw upon the amazing and

1234
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,200
singular work of Professor Mike Levin

1235
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,359
who wrote the computational boundary of

1236
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,640
a self developmental bioelectricity

1237
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,680
drives multicellularity and scale-free

1238
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,460
cognition in 2019 this was also explored

1239
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,160
in live stream 25 series

1240
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,079
so just to pull out a few of the great

1241
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,140
pieces of this article and there's a

1242
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,880
stigmerging trail of many other papers

1243
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,660
for those who follow

1244
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,160
Professor Levin writes I propose a

1245
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,380
definition of an individual

1246
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,720
based on its information processing

1247
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,220
structure

1248
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,500
the scale and types of goals that A

1249
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,020
system can pursue defines or determines

1250
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,819
the boundaries and the content of the

1251
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:43,800
putative agents

1252
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,200
on this view what defines a coherent

1253
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,300
unified self out of its constituents

1254
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,920
components and the surrounding

1255
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,420
environment is the set of parts that

1256
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,000
operate towards reaching specific goal

1257
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,079
States

1258
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:58,560
so this is a teleological or a

1259
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,380
functional or anticipatory or sentient

1260
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,800
or adaptive or informational concept on

1261
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,180
individuality

1262
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,940
which we can add to the earlier

1263
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,740
consideration

1264
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,200
raised by Gilbert at all

1265
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
here they discuss some of the more

1266
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,859
mechanistic biological considerations

1267
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,839
like genetics Immunology Evolution

1268
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:23,240
development anatomy and physiology

1269
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,260
what Levin has done here

1270
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,359
and consistent with this is the the

1271
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,359
informational theory of individuality by

1272
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,339
David krakauer at all

1273
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,560
is connect this more generally

1274
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,700
to system capacity and so there is what

1275
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,099
is uh here represented as like a Time

1276
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,660
diamond

1277
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,119
where the scope or the scale of the

1278
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,380
system in the now is like the radius or

1279
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,960
the circumference on this diamond

1280
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,599
and then the part of the diamond that

1281
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,400
recedes off into the past that's

1282
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,700
retained from the past is memory and

1283
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,020
history

1284
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,980
and the part that advances or protends

1285
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,700
into the future is the anticipatory or

1286
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,680
the planning capacity

1287
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,619
this opens the door to describing

1288
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:15,119
diverse intelligences

1289
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,700
including possible alien artificial

1290
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,319
intelligence or synthetic intelligences

1291
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:22,619
as well as nested or compound

1292
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:26,520
intelligences so here the example is the

1293
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,540
ant colony

1294
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,740
so here we have cells these little

1295
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,800
um pinkish

1296
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,900
diamonds nested Within

1297
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,059
a nest mate

1298
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,160
which is the green diamond

1299
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,559
nested within the colony which is the

1300
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,319
Blue Diamond now notice that the

1301
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,079
nestomate is called an organism

1302
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,480
couldn't help but to connect this to

1303
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,960
Wheeler 1911 whose work is the ant

1304
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,440
colony as an organism superorganism came

1305
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,160
later the super organismal framing on

1306
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,920
the ant colony

1307
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,440
reifies the concept that the nestme is

1308
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,599
the individual or the organism

1309
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,160
because why else would you need to call

1310
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,380
the colony a super organism I mean I

1311
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,300
think colonies are super I think it's

1312
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,619
great to call them whatever you want to

1313
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,000
call them and they probably don't mind

1314
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,280
either but the idea that a super

1315
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,480
organism is composed of other organisms

1316
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,920
means that the nestomate is an organism

1317
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,140
whereas this diagram in my perspective

1318
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,839
would be as accurate or more to say

1319
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,480
nestmate here because under different

1320
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,359
concepts of organismality which is to

1321
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:38,160
say individuality if we want to connect

1322
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,359
it there

1323
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,280
The Colony can be considered as the

1324
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,640
organism

1325
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,160
and of the so many other pieces of this

1326
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,859
work that are fun to to bring out the

1327
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:55,079
way that Levin clarifies his assumptions

1328
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,200
gives us first off some planks that we

1329
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,640
can jump off of

1330
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,839
for good

1331
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,119
and helps us come to terms with maybe

1332
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,460
like how do we what do we assume about

1333
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,980
Behavior about Collective Behavior how

1334
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,599
do we want to show up when we're

1335
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,040
studying Collective behavior in general

1336
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,859
and when we're studying social behavior

1337
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,440
after all we're in active inference for

1338
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,240
the social sciences

1339
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,400
and so Leven writes the ideas are

1340
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,960
explored here from the perspective of

1341
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,020
the following Three core assumptions

1342
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,420
first is a commitment to Evolution every

1343
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,980
capacity has a natural history and

1344
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,380
emerged from simpler variants

1345
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,420
second it is assumed that all metaphors

1346
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,339
are to be judged by their utility in

1347
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:37,440
driving scientific progress

1348
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,960
there is not a binary categorization of

1349
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,880
scientific pictures which should be

1350
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,160
taken literally or not which can be

1351
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,640
decided a priori up front

1352
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,859
third much of the discussion centers

1353
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,740
around goals related to teleology a

1354
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,319
hotly debated topic here goal directness

1355
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:58,079
is taken in the non-magical cybernetic

1356
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,940
engineering and control theory sense of

1357
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,680
a feedback system that operates to

1358
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,559
maximize some specific State of Affairs

1359
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,300
which can be modeled as a dynamical

1360
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,040
system with attractors in its state

1361
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,500
space and later work by 11 and Fields

1362
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,359
and others expanded this concept of

1363
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:15,480
intelligence just to phenomenal Heights

1364
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,819
and flavors so

1365
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,400
active inference helps us understand

1366
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,339
that cognitive glue

1367
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:26,400
maybe it's mechanistically enacted by

1368
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,800
bioelectricity in a given system or at a

1369
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,020
given scale but active inference gives

1370
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,200
us the analytical glue to approach those

1371
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,319
systems with an open mind

1372
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,780
and an open scaffold

1373
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,480
and so those are some of the insights

1374
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,700
and fundamentals of active inference as

1375
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,220
applied to Collective Behavioral Systems

1376
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,280
now on to the last third of this lecture

1377
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,800
applications and implications of active

1378
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,260
inference for the social sciences

1379
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,480
regarding Collective Behavior

1380
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,359
this is really where it is wide wide

1381
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,140
wide open

1382
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,579
what kinds of insights can active

1383
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,680
inference offer about the role of

1384
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,140
learning adaptation conflict and

1385
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,420
cooperation in Collective behavior and

1386
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,800
how can we approach that from a

1387
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,140
cognitive security perspective

1388
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,180
here we'll draw on the work of Scott

1389
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,400
David and colleagues active inference

1390
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,440
and modeling conflict

1391
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,359
what implications does active inference

1392
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,980
have on the study of human Collective

1393
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,140
Behavior particularly in social economic

1394
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,119
and digital contexts

1395
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,280
here we'll draw on the work by Poirier

1396
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,020
at all

1397
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,000
communication as socially extended

1398
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,339
active inference an ecological approach

1399
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,859
to communicative Behavior live stream 48

1400
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,098
series

1401
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,059
what considerations that are relevant

1402
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,420
for thinking about assemblages

1403
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,280
and interactions

1404
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,440
what what considerations are relevant

1405
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,880
for thinking about assemblages and

1406
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,680
interactions among different entities in

1407
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,420
cognitive ecosystems

1408
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,359
here we'll turn to the work of friston

1409
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,880
at all at all 2022.

1410
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,859
designing ecosystems of intelligence

1411
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,660
from first principles

1412
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,579
and how does active inference

1413
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:13,800
accommodate Collective Behavior within

1414
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,020
and across generations and here we'll

1415
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,880
look at a variational synthesis of

1416
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,859
evolutionary and developmental Dynamics

1417
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:23,099
by friction at all in 2023.

1418
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,559
so when it comes to applications and

1419
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,260
implications of active inference in

1420
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,260
Social sitting sittings and settings

1421
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,059
again there's so much to do there's so

1422
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,160
much to learn so we welcome everybody

1423
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,740
who's curious this is the time to write

1424
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,440
your live chats submit your questions

1425
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,980
prepare yourself to explore and to be an

1426
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,319
active forager in this space and if

1427
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,640
you're listening you know that you

1428
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,200
already are

1429
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,359
so in the work active inference in

1430
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,920
modeling conflict

1431
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,700
Scott David r j corday and myself asked

1432
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,680
what kinds of insights can active

1433
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,599
inference offer about the role of

1434
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:02,400
learning adaptation conflict and

1435
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,099
cooperation in Collective Behavior now

1436
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:06,720
as with all these other papers there's

1437
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,420
always so many things that can be said

1438
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,280
what we did is we tried to connect

1439
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,819
beyond the very classical Markov blanket

1440
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:16,740
and agent environment partitioning which

1441
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,140
we've seen many many times we tried to

1442
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,660
connect this to the specific kind of

1443
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,599
generative models that we use in

1444
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,260
modeling so here we LED early by

1445
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,880
clarifying this is what we're talking

1446
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,859
about with active inference generative

1447
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:33,780
models it's not like something I'm

1448
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,819
hiding in my pocket and maybe I'll show

1449
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:38,160
you if you say the shibboleth this is

1450
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,200
what we're talking about when we're

1451
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,880
talking about applying active inference

1452
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,520
models to social settings it's a

1453
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,380
discrete time generative model here

1454
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,260
just a motif

1455
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,619
we applied that kind of generative model

1456
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,180
architecture

1457
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,500
to one of the most well-known models of

1458
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,540
sense making and decision making which

1459
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,720
is the UDA Loop observe Orient aside act

1460
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,660
by Jon Voight now this may seem to sound

1461
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,819
like a quite sparse framework like yeah

1462
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,380
you get the observation you figure it

1463
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,940
out you make a decision you take the

1464
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,500
action

1465
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,480
it doesn't do that more much work by

1466
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,059
itself either however UDA is used in

1467
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,920
tactical and strategic settings every

1468
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,460
single day and so we wanted to connect

1469
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,839
UDA Loop

1470
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:27,359
to the generative models that we use in

1471
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,800
active inference and so we highlighted

1472
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,780
on the generative model

1473
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,180
where different stages of the ooda loop

1474
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,460
occur perception happens in the sensory

1475
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,280
States cognition or the the orientation

1476
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,020
happens

1477
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,819
in the perceptual inference the

1478
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,220
downstairs of that part of the figure

1479
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,380
and then decision making happens in the

1480
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,480
upstairs with the expected free energy

1481
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,819
calculation in this case and finally

1482
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:54,119
action is selected and enacted and that

1483
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:56,460
results in impact and the cycle begins

1484
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,559
again now in active inference it's more

1485
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,140
like an unfolding flow but to a first

1486
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,200
pass approximation it does the trick

1487
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,660
what does that really matter that we

1488
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,339
understand the mechanics of decision

1489
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:11,280
making well we're talking about active

1490
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,380
inference in the social setting

1491
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,200
that means we're talking about two

1492
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,540
sophisticated cognitive entities maybe

1493
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,640
two businesses maybe two individual

1494
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,960
humans maybe a person and a business

1495
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,400
maybe different kinds of systems that we

1496
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,839
don't even know about or we haven't even

1497
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,940
seen yet

1498
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,339
and that generative model

1499
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,380
is the internal States

1500
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,780
that is then participating in this

1501
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,299
minimal dyadic Collective behavioral

1502
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:40,799
encounter

1503
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,619
we can expand that to thinking about

1504
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:46,260
comments resource Commons attention

1505
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,579
Commons

1506
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:49,740
open source ecosystems

1507
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,140
and for this we utilized one of Scott

1508
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,420
David's favorite acronyms of which he

1509
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,619
has so so many which is bolts business

1510

operation legal Technical and social

1511
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,980
bolts is not an exhaustive acronym

1512
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,839
otherwise we would need everything

1513
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:09,000
but it's a heuristic that encourages us

1514
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,819
to think holistically about different

1515
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:13,740
systems let's just say that we were a

1516
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,599
business or a person and we wanted to

1517
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,240
see if a given policy was a good way to

1518
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,099
go to complete our mission

1519
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:21,480
and

1520
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,059
it looks good except it can't be done

1521
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:27,420
operationally well then that has to be

1522
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,700
taken into account or everything works

1523
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,640
out but it's illegal that's not the way

1524
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,680
to go everything works out but the

1525
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,940
business doesn't check out it's not

1526
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,680
going to be sustainable financially

1527
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,079
or technically it can't be done or

1528
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,059
socially it's not palatable

1529
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,640
all these features of socio-technical

1530
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,319
systems which again we just make a

1531
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,660
little mnemonic of with bolts need to be

1532
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,420
taken into account for comprehensive and

1533
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,640
high integrity High reliability systems

1534
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,420
design

1535
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,220
in this setting we have entity a and

1536
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,599
entity B interacting through the bolts

1537
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,220
Niche they each have their own blanket

1538
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,960
States sense in action

1539
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,480
and the niche where those Nest mates

1540
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,099
were laying their pheromones

1541
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:11,640
the niche is bolts and so you can make a

1542
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,140
restricted model where it's just two

1543
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,359
entities engaged in a financial dealing

1544
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,359
just a business only engaging on B

1545
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:20,520
or you could think of this multi-domain

1546
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,339
full spectrum situation in terms of

1547
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:24,540
bolts

1548
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,180
then you would have a larger and a more

1549
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,740
complex interface between these two

1550
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,819
entities

1551
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:32,520
but we also wanted to think about the

1552
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,839
case where there might be cooperation

1553
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,000
between these entities or there might be

1554
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,339
conflict and so here we have entity A

1555
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:41,760
and B the diad is in the spotlight

1556
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,660
entity C is a non-belligerent state or

1557
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,880
is a bystander or it's a witness or it's

1558
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,099
a referee or it's a friend or it's a

1559
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:53,099
colleague but entity C is also engaging

1560
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:56,160
only through their blanket States

1561
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,900
on bolts

1562
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,119
and lastly we connect it to the abiotic

1563
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,420
Niche which may not care how much you're

1564
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,819
buying or selling a gallon of oil for

1565
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,920
the abiotic Niche may have its own

1566
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,660
Dynamics we may use active inference to

1567
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,859
model that or we might use some other

1568
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:14,880
approach to model it and so this sets a

1569
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,280
really really General State space for us

1570
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,160
to understand conflict and cooperation

1571
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,040
and where we situated that work lastly

1572
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,819
here

1573
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:27,260
was in relationship to other work

1574
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,260
exploring strategic and tactical

1575
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:33,119
decision making and so on the lower end

1576
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,460
of this image are tactical and

1577
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,380
operational Frameworks that are used in

1578
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,260
decision making on the top are strategic

1579
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,940
or scholarly Frameworks that are used

1580
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,200
for more of like geopolitical

1581
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,480
considerations and then from left to

1582
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,339
right we have more qualitative

1583
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:50,579
approaches going to more formal and

1584
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:52,559
quantitative approaches and we believe

1585
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,380
that the application of active inference

1586
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,119
through this type of model the octave

1587
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,619
inference conflict model

1588
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:01,380
helps us touch the qualitative natural

1589
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,480
language and graphical composable

1590
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,359
aspects and the quantitative and formal

1591
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,700
aspects as well and similarly through

1592
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,579
nested decision-making Cycles we can

1593
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,460
talk about tactical operational

1594
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,220
activities and the broader nested

1595
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,339
strategy just like we looked at the

1596
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:24,558
nested cones from Professor Levin's work

1597
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,299
next what implications does active

1598
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:29,040
inference have on the study of human

1599
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,799
Collective Behavior particularly in

1600
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,900
social economic and digital contexts

1601
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,760
well there's a lot to say about this but

1602
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,180
Tucson and Poirier wrote in 2021 the

1603
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,000
paper communication as socially extended

1604
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,040
active inference an ecological approach

1605
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,200
to communicative behavior and this was

1606
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,280
in the live stream 48 series here's Remy

1607
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,339
raising his hands so that we knew that

1608
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:55,740
he wanted to speak

1609
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,140
they introduced an ecological account of

1610
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,260
communication According to which acts of

1611
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,540
communication are active inference

1612
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,520
achieved by affecting the behavior of a

1613
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,980
Target organism via the modification of

1614
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,920
its field of affordances

1615
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,720
constraining a Target organism's

1616
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,520
Behavior constitutes a mechanism of

1617
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,200
socially extended active inference

1618
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,299
allowing

1619
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:21,119
organisms to proactively

1620
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,339
regulate their interstates through the

1621
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,140
behavior of other organisms

1622
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,880
in this General conception of

1623
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,280
communication the type of Cooperative

1624
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,319
communication characteristic of human

1625
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:33,780
communicative interaction is a way of

1626
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,480
constraining interaction Dynamics

1627
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,280
towards the goals of a given joint

1628
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,200
action by constructing and altering

1629
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,900
shared fields of affordances

1630
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,839
this account Embraces a pragmatist view

1631
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,059
According to which communication is a

1632
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:50,099
form of action aiming to influence the

1633
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,319
behavior of a Target and stands against

1634
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:53,819
the traditional transmission view

1635
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:55,260
According to which communication

1636
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,000
fundamentally serves to convey

1637
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,380
information

1638
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,480
understanding acts of communication as

1639
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,400
active inference under an ecological

1640
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,260
interpretation

1641
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,200
allows us to link communicative and

1642
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,180
ultimately linguistic Behavior to the

1643
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,040
biological imperative of minimizing free

1644
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,720
energy and to emphasize the

1645
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,180
action-oriented nature of communicative

1646
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:19,079
interaction this is really a rich and

1647
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:21,480
excellent work that Remy and Pierre

1648
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,799
produced

1649
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,440
and there are several pieces that that I

1650
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,900
think add a lot of meaning and value to

1651
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:28,740
the ways that we think about

1652
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,740
communication but most broadly what is

1653
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,119
communication for

1654
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,579
who do we talk to and why what do we

1655
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:37,440
like to talk about and why

1656
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,220
why would anyone say that and why

1657
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,680
how does technique

1658
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,319
considered broadly technology and

1659
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,339
technique

1660
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,440
whether it's digital or social or

1661
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,900
cultural technique

1662
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,940
mediate and influence communication

1663
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,339
the media is the message the medium is

1664
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:57,180
the message

1665
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,799
and think about everything in that area

1666
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,500
too and how can active inference Beyond

1667
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,960
just giving these incredible composable

1668
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,819
formal tools

1669
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:07,799
how can we think about

1670
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:11,119
joint action and

1671
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,799
co-modification of fields of affordances

1672
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,720
could you could you pick that up from

1673
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,240
from that shelf okay I'll open it for

1674
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,980
you now let's hand it to our friend

1675
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,720
who's going to make the food

1676
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,299
all of these ways in which individuals

1677
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:27,839
shape each other's field of affordances

1678
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,280
is something that we can talk about

1679
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,380
really fluidly within active inference

1680
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,539
penultimate View

1681
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:39,359
what considerations are relevant for

1682
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,640
thinking about assemblages and

1683
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,859
interactions among different entities in

1684
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:45,599
cognitive ecosystems

1685
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,780
so here was a a large multi-authored

1686
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,599
paper from Carl friston at all and the

1687
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,000
versus colleagues designing ecosystems

1688
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,440
of intelligence from first principles

1689
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,960
from December 2022.

1690
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,020
and the big picture as I see it here is

1691
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,920
what is the role of the social sciences

1692
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,380
after all the course that we're in now

1693
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,819
in ecosystems of diverse heterogeneous

1694
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,819
synthetic intelligences by synthetic

1695
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:17,640
intelligences I refer to assemblages

1696
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,799
with intelligence whether it's natural

1697
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:22,319
or artificial leave that debate for

1698
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,460
another day

1699
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,240
because in their application we're

1700
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,740
talking about synthetic intelligence

1701
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,720
synthetic intelligence needs cognitive

1702
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,119
security cognitive security needs

1703
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,220
cognitive science

1704
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,680
and they began this paper with the

1705
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,480
following this white paper presents

1706
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,980
active inference as an approach to

1707
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,780
research and development in the field of

1708
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,200
artificial intelligence AI artificial

1709
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,839
with the aim of developing ecosystems of

1710
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,900
natural and artificial intelligences

1711
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,940
the path forward in AI is often

1712
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,619
presented as progressing from systems

1713
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:57,299
that are able to solve problems within

1714
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,799
one narrow domain

1715
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:02,280
artificial narrow intelligence a-n-i to

1716
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,839
systems that are able to solve problems

1717
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,480
in a domain General manner at or Beyond

1718
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,859
human levels What are known as

1719
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:10,619
artificial general intelligence AGI and

1720
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,980
artificial super intelligence ASI

1721
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,738
we believe that approaching ASI

1722
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:19,279
or for reasons outlined below even AGI

1723
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,899
likely requires an understanding of

1724
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,238
networked or collective intelligence

1725
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,899
now intelligence in action is behavior

1726
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:29,819
so we're talking about Collective

1727
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:30,779
Behavior

1728
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,779
and they laid out their timeline and the

1729
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,160
stages that they see in terms of

1730
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,560
sentient sophisticated sympathetic and

1731
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,319
finally shared intelligences but I think

1732
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,359
it's worth to dwell a moment on the one

1733
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:45,359
figure of this paper

1734
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,479
one belief updating on a statistical

1735
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:49,799
manifold

1736
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:52,020
and so here we have some curve in an

1737
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,120
information geometric space

1738
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,160
it's a parameter space of a probability

1739
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,719
distribution

1740
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:03,000
and on this manifold on this line on a

1741
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,160
plane lower dimensional manifold

1742
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,779
projection

1743
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,040
there's

1744
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,560
a temporal process belief at time t t

1745
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,779
plus one t plus two where initially this

1746
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:18,060
gaussian that's very distributed

1747
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,060
becomes updated to a sharper Peak

1748
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,679
distribution that's going to be resting

1749
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,160
basically at some special point on this

1750
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,439
curve

1751
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,238
whether you're very familiar with

1752
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,759
accelerated optimization on information

1753
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,000
geometric manifolds or not

1754
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,339
it's really interesting to consider why

1755
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:41,100
they went with this image and for those

1756
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,259
again who are familiar or just coming to

1757
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:45,238
be familiar with some of the formalisms

1758
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:47,160
of active inference

1759
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,698
this is what this very talented and

1760
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:52,439
transdisciplinary team

1761
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,060
went with

1762
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,840
when seeking to provide some of the only

1763
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,940
non-textual descriptions of their work

1764
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:03,239
so I think it's really interesting and

1765
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:06,120
the big question is well what is the

1766
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,620
social

1767
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,840
reassembling the social Bruno LaTour

1768
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,140
what is the social what is social

1769
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,620
does social mean only adult humans

1770
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,120
talking with each other

1771
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,679
does social include non-human species

1772
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,380
does social include

1773
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,780
non-biological intelligences these are

1774
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,420
all things that are not just questions

1775
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,679
of theory

1776
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,800
and so connecting flexible extensible

1777
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,780
Frameworks like active inference and all

1778
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,520
that comes along with it

1779
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,040
to this bigger question about

1780
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,620
applications and implications

1781
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,719
of Applied active inference in the

1782
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:47,880
social setting that's what I hope we can

1783
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,460
explore in the questions at the end of

1784
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,080
this live stream and in the discussions

1785
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,120
that we have in a couple of weeks and

1786
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,860
ongoing

1787
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,440
and lastly how does active inference

1788
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,080
accommodate Collective Behavior within

1789
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,420
and across generations and so here I'll

1790
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,340
draw on the recent work of variational

1791
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,679
synthesis of evolutionary and

1792
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,199
developmental Dynamics with Carl friston

1793
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,360
myself and others

1794
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,920
and we had two

1795
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,800
images in this work which otherwise had

1796
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,140
a lot of prose and formalism

1797
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,320
on the left we see that active inference

1798
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,000
particular partition

1799
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,219
external States internal States blanket

1800
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:27,360
States

1801
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,420
here at the organismal level

1802
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,860
one worm

1803
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,659
and in an enested deeper system the

1804
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,500
population which gives rise

1805
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,840
to the starting positionality of the

1806
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,060
organisms think about drawing an

1807
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,699
organism from a gene pool from a birth

1808
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,080
pool

1809
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,699
and the impact that those organisms have

1810
01:11:53,699 --> 01:11:57,000
on the bigger picture maybe it's a

1811
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,460
bacteria that

1812
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,219
is fermenting so it changes the pH or

1813
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:03,960
the ethanol concentration of the

1814
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,480
kombucha that is this kind of

1815
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,719
multi-scale interaction

1816
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,300
that we believe provides an approach to

1817
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,300
understanding eco-evo Devo

1818
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,760
ecology Evolution and developmental

1819
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,500
interactions

1820
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,480
and the other visualization that we use

1821
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,440
here

1822
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,920
is of nested systems so contrast that

1823
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,840
with the kind of

1824
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,520
time Diamond that we saw from Mike Levin

1825
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,580
now here imagine that we're going to cut

1826
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,500
across

1827
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,199
the sensor of this diamond

1828
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,820
and now it's going to look like a muscle

1829
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:45,420
fiber fibers of fibers because we have

1830
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,440
let's just say this outer Blue Line

1831
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,739
maybe the um

1832
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,960
The Colony

1833
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,500
and then each of these smaller

1834
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,420
entities is an S mate and they're

1835
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,100
composed of cells and cells have

1836
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,659
constituents too

1837
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:08,280
and here we utilized the apparatus of

1838
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,320
the renormalization group which draws

1839
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,140
upon physics to articulate the

1840
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,120
separation of scales

1841
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,980
so that we can be clear when are we

1842
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,739
talking about multi-scale systems which

1843
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:22,320
we can articulate and renormalize across

1844
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,360
vertically

1845
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,239
to use an encultured metaphor and then

1846
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:30,540
within a given scale of analysis what is

1847
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,840
the lateral or Collective Behavior so

1848
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,580
how do we get those interactions amongst

1849
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,640
Nest mates that are both constrained by

1850
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,219
The Colony top down again using a

1851
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:44,300
spatial and uncultured metaphor top down

1852
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,040
scaffolded or enabled or constrained by

1853
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,140
The Colony but then what Nest mates do

1854
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,500
matters and that influences The Colony

1855
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,739
and we used a few new pieces of

1856
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:58,860
formalism primarily developed by Carl to

1857
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:01,860
help Express that setting and again we

1858
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,960
think it's going to be really useful for

1859
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,340
describing

1860
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,940
otherwise quite challenging scenarios in

1861
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,100
ecology Evolution and development

1862
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,179
and so we come right back to that what

1863
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:19,440
is a self what about nested selves

1864
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,840
and with that I turn to some open

1865
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,760
questions

1866
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,940
what can be said other than

1867
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,239
there are so many open questions to

1868
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,380
discuss

1869
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,360
there's

1870
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,120
many things we can explore

1871
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,280
in the discussion that I'll be

1872
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,199
facilitating in a couple weeks and of

1873
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:41,520
course Beyond

1874
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,880
we have a coda interface for you to

1875
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,100
submit questions that all the course

1876
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,840
teachers will take a look at and give

1877
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,520
their best attempt on

1878
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,320
and

1879
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,840
conversation is collective Behavior now

1880
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,600
sure keeping it inside of your head is

1881
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,280
also Collective Behavior

1882
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,400
no matter how you think about it but

1883
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,880
when we enact in the social

1884
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,320
then

1885
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,000
we're really making it happen

1886
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,340
so with that I'll just show my citations

1887
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,320
and the slides will be shared too also

1888
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,960
there's some extra readings that various

1889
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,000
individuals along the way suggested to

1890
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,540
me so that includes um social ecology is

1891
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,000
an abductive logic and acting like a

1892
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,900
state

1893
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,699
these are not the titles the titles are

1894
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:32,040
inactive Dynamic social cognition and

1895
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,360

different kinds of social organizations

1902

explained through reference to

1903
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:47,340
industrial engineering and quality

1904

work on self-organization free energy

01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,659
cognition and culture

1915
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,020
well

1916
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:19,860
I hope this has been a interesting and

1917
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:23,100
relevant lecture for you

1918
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,840
it was fun to prepare there are so many

1919
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,060
perspectives and so much territory

1920
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,040
that

1921
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,300
there's a lot

1922
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,640
in Collective Behavior but again I'm

1923
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,380
just really looking forward to the

1924
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,420
discussion that we can have in a couple

1925
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,760
of weeks I encourage you whether you're

1926
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,540
listening on your timeline

1927
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,360
add a moment that enables you to join

1928
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,280
that live conversation I would encourage

1929
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,440
you to join or to join the live stream

1930
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,940
so you can participate through through

1931
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,820
chat or whether you want to find some

1932
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,400
other way to get involved

1933
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,520
it's been a great time and with that I

1934
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,659
will close

1935
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:07,519
thank you very much until next time
