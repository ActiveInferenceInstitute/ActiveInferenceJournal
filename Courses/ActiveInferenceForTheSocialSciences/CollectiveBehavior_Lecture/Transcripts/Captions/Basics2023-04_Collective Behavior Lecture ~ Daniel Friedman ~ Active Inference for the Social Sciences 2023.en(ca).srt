00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,930
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,616
It is August 2, 2023. We're in

3
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,440
the active inference for the Social

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,540
Sciences course. I'm Daniel Friedman,

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,232
and this is going to be a lecture on

6
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:24,192
collective behavior. Now of course,

7
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:26,416
disclaimers could abound and there's so

8
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:28,352
many ways to go about this topic of

9
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:31,160
collective behavior that in duality, in

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,084
enactment, I really hope it is multi

11
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,552
scale and collective. I'm really looking

12
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:38,424
forward to your comments and your

13
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:40,504
engagement with this area, with this

14
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,776
lecture, with this course. So if you're

15
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:45,064
watching Live, you can add comments into

16
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:47,144
the live chat or questions and I'll

17
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:50,028
check them out at the end. Also in the

18
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:52,220
YouTube live chat and in the video

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,876
description, there is a link to where

20
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,696
you can submit questions for all of the

21
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,768
teachers of this course. That's going to

22
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:03,820
be a coda form. And just more generally,

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,056
let's have fun enacting ecosystems of

24
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:09,636
shared intelligence together. And I hope

25
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:12,870
that this lecture can be something like

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,220
one attempt to make that happen.

27
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,568
epistemically, we're going

28
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,376
to have many fun things to talk about

29
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,684
collective behavior. What differentiates

30
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,988
it from simply behavior? I mean, aren't

31
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:31,624
all behaving systems assemblages? Is not

32
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,524
the brain composed of multiple parts,

33
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:36,056
brain and body, multiple people? What

34
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:37,244
are we really talking about with

35
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,052
individual behavior? Why do we need

36
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,996
adjectives at all for behavior? What is

37
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,076
a collective and how would we even know

38
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:45,616
it except through its behavior? So

39
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,008
there's going to be all kinds of fun

40
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:47,920
topics.

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,256
Avel provided me with this image and

42
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,112
suggested that it would be a great place

43
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,916
to head towards. And so we can think of

44
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:00,836
this as where we're going. And where

45
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,604
we're going is understanding the agent

46
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:07,428
or the human in a social

47
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:10,312
relationship through social action and

48
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,424
the recipient of social constraints and

49
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:16,584
observations through that interface or

50
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:19,080
blanket or holographic screen, the agent

51
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,832
or the human is engaging on this

52
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:25,256
sociocultural landscape. And so we can

53
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,884
think about that agent of engagement

54
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,716
with a social world and the dynamic of

55
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,256
sociocultural constraints. Now that's

56
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,036
where we're going, and that's how

57
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:34,776
someone else has framed where we're

58
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:37,644
going. What I'll tell you here is how

59
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,164
we're getting there, how we're getting

60
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,168
there. It's going to be a lot of fun.

61
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,264
There's going to be a lot of ants, and

62
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:45,920
the door is going to be wide open. So

63
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,320
everyone is an estimate on this slide

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,848
and we're going to be with our regimes

65
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:53,504
of attention and our stigmaergic trails

66
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:55,876
just absolutely up, down, left, right,

67
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:58,820
all over this sociocultural landscape.

68
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,536
All right, so here's the plan for the

69
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,688
collective behavior lecture. It's going

70
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:08,500
to be presented as a sequence of views.

71
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,304
Each view or perspective is going to

72
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:14,424
consist of at very least a central

73
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:17,100
citation and then one or more

74
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,500
reflections on that citation.

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,028
Four views on collective behavior taken

76
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:26,924
as a bundle will constitute a main

77
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:29,696
section of this lecture. And there are

78
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,632
going to be three main sections of this

79
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,544
lecture split on one hand into three

80
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,752
groups of four and on the other hand

81
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:40,144
into two groups of six splitting

82
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:42,516
into fours. The main three sections are

83
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,980
going to be background and Context,

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,636
which is going to provide some views and

85
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:49,776
insights that are from outside of active

86
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,576
inference because surprise, surprise,

87
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,584
what was true before active inference or

88
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:56,600
outside of active inference is also true

89
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,448
within and after. Then we're going to

90
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,444
turn to active inference. Specifically,

91
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,016
we're going to talk about active

92
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,276
inference insights and fundamentals for

93
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:08,732
collective behavior and applications and

94
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:11,516
implications of utilizing or of

95
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:14,348
conceptualizing of a social system as an

96
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,024
active inference system. So those second

97
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:18,848
two sections are each going to center

98
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,808
around also specific recent work in the

99
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:25,596
field to split it into two groups

100
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:29,284
of six. The first six views that are

101
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:31,076
presented so all of background and

102
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,088
context and then half of the insights

103
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:35,364
and fundamentals are going to be in

104
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:37,712
support linguistically or rhetorically

105
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:40,616
of a declarative statement, whereas the

106
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:44,008
latter six views are going to support

107
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:47,076
or open up to a question. And that'll

108
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:49,604
lead us to the final section, the fourth

109
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:52,170
section, which is some open questions.

110
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,544
At that time, I will look at the live

111
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,404
chat and review any questions or

112
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,532
thoughts that people have. And I'll also

113
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,236
just open the door and leave it open

114
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,248
with asking questions, because that's

115
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:05,868
something that we're going to be engaged

116
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:09,104
in for so long. So let's go

117
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,588
right into the first section,

118
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:14,576
background and context. Here are the

119
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,844
four views and the four declarative

120
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,952
statements. Big picture.

121
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:22,864
Many, if not all of the concepts,

122
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,836
discussions, questions and views on

123
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,564
collective behavior from before or

124
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:29,316
outside of active inference also apply

125
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:32,056
after or inside active inference or in

126
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,760
the active inference ecosystem. And so

127
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,272
to support and to build out that point,

128
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,952
I'm going to talk about four different

129
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,250
works and some takeaways. First,

130
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,248
watching behavior is complex. Here we'll

131
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,636
look at Deborah Gordon's 1992 paper.

132
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:50,510
Wittgenstein and Ant watching.

133
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,816
Second, all intelligence is Collective

134
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,864
Intelligence, which was a presentation

135
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:58,036
of the same name by J. F. Klaudier

136
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:00,288
earlier this year, referencing a paper

137
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:03,696
of the same name. Third. We have never

138
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:06,508
been individuals. A work by Gilbert et

139
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:09,812
al. From 2012, A Symbiotic View of Life

140
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,356
we Have Never Been Individuals, little

141
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,036
bit of the play on we have never been

142
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:17,584
modern and the metaphors

143
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:20,452
and frameworks and language that we use

144
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,036
to talk about behavior, to talk about

145
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,216
collective behavior, what adjectives we

146
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,024
put in front of, what nouns, that

147
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:29,284
matters. And a great work that Ali

148
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:31,096
shared with me that I think makes this

149
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:34,908
point super well is by Navarro and

150
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:38,572
Gabriellitis from 23. And that work

151
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:39,976
is the morphology of collective

152
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:43,112
intelligence. Network swarm, multitude

153
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:46,912
or assemblage. So let's head straight to

154
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,696
Professor Gordon's 1992 work on

155
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:52,930
Wittgenstein and Ant Watching. And so

156
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,844
just also for context, professor Gordon

157
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,812
was my PhD advisor and so I was able to

158
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,844
engage with this material and

159
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:05,030
perspective through asynchronous means

160
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,900
such as this paper, but also seeing it

161
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,316
actually play out on a sociocultural

162
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,636
landscape in the desert in southeast

163
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,564
Arizona. That's where the complexity

164
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:20,536
really flowered. And so research

165
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:22,932
in animal behavior begins by identifying

166
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:25,356
what animals are doing in the course of

167
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,484
observation. The observer comes to see

168
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,148
animals as performing a particular

169
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,188
activity. How does this process work?

170
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,204
How can we be certain that behavior is

171
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,468
identified correctly? Wittgenstein

172
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,144
offers an approach to these questions,

173
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:41,184
looking at the uses of certainty rather

174
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,704
than attempting to find rules that

175
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,456
guarantee it. Here, two stages in

176
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,136
research are distinguished. First,

177
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,936
watching animals, and second, reporting

178
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,780
the results to other scientists.

179
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,948
Certainty about what animals are doing

180
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:58,116
has different uses at each stage. And

181
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:00,756
this is really a beautiful and subtle

182
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:04,644
point by distinguishing stages

183
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,904
of the ethological encounter, the

184
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:09,028
behavioral scientific encounter,

185
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,888
whether we're talking about ants on the

186
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:13,400
ground or people in the cities,

187
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,690
separating out the observational moment

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,164
and the uncertainties that are always at

189
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:23,752
play there from this secondary

190
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:26,944
communication about behavior at which

191
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:30,220
point having really clear defined

192
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,976
articulations of behavior becomes so

193
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:34,124
important for scientific

194
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,868
reproducibility, integrity,

195
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:39,776
accessibility and so on. Personally,

196
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:42,820
I find that this paper anticipates a lot

197
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,876
of the specifications that today we

198
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:47,712
would consider part of the metabasian

199
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,536
perspective, which is to say we're

200
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:52,468
making inferences as cognitive systems

201
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:55,400
about other cognitive systems.

202
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,744
She wrote, My questions about ant

203
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:00,872
watching do not arise when I'm watching

204
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:04,172
ants. Most of the time, I do not think

205
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:06,524
much about certainty when ant watching.

206
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,572
Replace that for the social human

207
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,100
setting with people watching. Sometimes

208
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,336
we're just watching people, and that's

209
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:16,736
okay. That's part of the moment. I do

210
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,512
not think much about certainty when ant

211
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,530
watching. I enact it.

212
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,844
The questions do not come from doubts

213
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:27,104
about the certainty of my seeing, but

214
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:28,656
from the ways that doubts about the

215
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,176
certainty of seeing have shaped

216
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,948
scientific practice. The resolution of

217
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,548
the problem would come from changes that

218
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,516
would allow observers to talk about what

219
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,948
they are actually doing when watching

220
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:42,420
animals. Truthful accounts of scientific

221
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,944
animal watching don't yet exist. This

222
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:47,816
truth is not yet formed because we have

223
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,330
not yet learned to talk about it.

224
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,180
What a wonderful expression and

225
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,544
delightfully. I came to see the confused

226
00:09:57,592 --> 00:10:00,044
foragers as patrollers searching for new

227
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,172
food. I saw the other foragers as

228
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,632
already decided about their destination,

229
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,704
not available to be distracted by a new

230
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:08,816
source of food. And so we have this

231
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,736
really fascinating dialectic where in

232
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:14,112
the moment we're observing in this

233
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,532
predefinitional space. Not questioning,

234
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,264
though maybe we went to the field site

235
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,204
to ask and answer a question, get data

236
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:23,444
about a question. But in the moment,

237
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:26,372
we're in the flow of observation and not

238
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,248
asking questions, though the uncertainty

239
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:32,856
may be the highest afterwards when

240
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,612
we're communicating to our scientific

241
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,676
colleagues. I defined an outgoing

242
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,536
forager as a forager as

243
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,380
a nest mate with no object in the

244
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,816
mandibles and heading off in a straight

245
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:49,516
line passing a demarcated .3

246
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:52,124
meters from the colony entrance, then

247
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,916
people, well, why 3 meters? Why not 2

248
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,916
meters? Or why can't it be carrying

249
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,840
something on the way out? Those

250
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,152
questions arise in that precise space

251
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:04,784
of communication. And I

252
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:06,624
wanted to open the lecture with this

253
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:10,036
view because it puts a space between.

254
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:12,870
I see that person putting out a fire.

255
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,540
They're a firefighter. In that space

256
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,872
between is the interpretive moment and

257
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:23,896
possibility. And reimagining the social

258
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:27,432
has so much to do with this process of,

259
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,610
let's just say, ant watching.

260
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,996
Second view in this background and

261
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:37,004
context section. And here I wanted to

262
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:40,428
draw from a wonderful presentation that

263
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:43,244
JF. Cloutier, a facilitator and

264
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,060
participant at the Active Inference

265
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,552
institute, presented as part of his

266
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,672
robotics and embodied project, where,

267
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:53,184
yes, he's building Lego robots that do

268
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,360
symbolic active inference, but also

269
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,852
opening up some great philosophical

270
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,356
directions and ones that have a lot of

271
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:02,452
implications for how we think about

272
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,672
natural, artificial and synthetic

273
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:07,204
intelligence. This presentation was

274
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:08,896
called All Intelligence is Collective

275
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,624
Intelligence, and it was based upon the

276
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:14,888
title and drawing upon a

277
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:18,436
recent 2022 citation by Fallon Days et

278
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:22,416
al. And some of these maxims

279
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:26,140
or expressions that JF provided,

280
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,110
I thought were so provocative and also

281
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,216
brought us back to that initial

282
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:34,876
question, why collective behavior? I

283
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:37,276
mean, what system isn't a collective?

284
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,916
So why do we need the adjective if we're

285
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:42,784
talking about behaving systems? What is

286
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:45,184
individual behavior? Individual what?

287
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,296
Oh, just one bird. Oh, just one person.

288
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,330
Okay. Made up of what?

289
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,476
And so JF wrote some expressions, and

290
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:55,988
you can see from the link and look a

291
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,116
little more with some images and more of

292
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:00,216
what he wrote. But a few of these, I

293
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,492
thought, were just excellent.

294
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,024
Intelligence is a process enacted by

295
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:06,264
interacting parts, not a property of

296
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,536
individuals. Again, whatever that would

297
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:11,800
even mean. Inaction is death.

298
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,704
Being by doing action without prediction

299
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,292
is reckless. No prediction without sense

300
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:22,412
making. No sense made without a self

301
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:26,130
versus the world or a self in the world.

302
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,924
A collective is differently intelligent

303
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,532
than its members. Maybe trivially

304
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:34,192
different, maybe better in every way,

305
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,770
maybe another direction in every way.

306
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,612
Why do individuals participate in

307
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,740
collectives? Why are people in groups?

308
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,416
Because sacrificing the autonomy to

309
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:55,956
the collective provides benefit,

310
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,970
survival, or even thrival benefits

311
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,716
that's that I to we no

312
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,944
making of sense without the self acting

313
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,412
in or on the world. It's not just some

314
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:11,084
essence that's disembodied. This is what

315
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:14,504
embodiment is all about. An autonomous

316
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,736
agent is a self organizing collective of

317
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:19,216
parts. Parts of a collective can

318
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,250
themselves be autonomous agents.

319
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,272
Collectives form to improve the chance

320
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:26,816
of survival of their members. And an

321
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:28,836
agent in a collective benefits from the

322
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:32,756
intelligence of the collective. So to

323
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,756
me, this presentation and line of

324
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,268
research pursued by JF and others

325
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:40,776
absolutely puts a bow on the what is an

326
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,304
individual, what is a collective? Why do

327
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,492
we even talk about, quote,

328
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:48,820
individuals or quote collectives

329
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,700
when we recognize the multiscale nature

330
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,900
of complex adaptive systems.

331
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,324
Third Perspective a

332
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,484
Symbiotic view of Life we have never

333
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,124
been individuals. This is a 2012 paper

334
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:08,256
by Gilbert, SAP and Tower and

335
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:10,336
just to read a few aspects of what they

336
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,096
wrote in the abstract. The notion of the

337
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,096
biological individual is crucial to

338
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,660
studies of genetics, immunology,

339
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,668
evolution, develop anatomy and

340
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:20,432
physiology. Each of these biological

341
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:23,184
subdisciplines has a specific conception

342
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:25,920
of individuality which has historically

343
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,004
provided conceptual context for

344
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,650
integrating newly acquired data.

345
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,584
Few descriptions animals cannot be

346
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:39,624
considered individuals by anatomical or

347
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:42,008
physiological criteria because a

348
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:44,460
diversity of symbionts are both present

349
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,456
and functional in completing metabolic

350
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,696
pathways and serving other physiological

351
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:51,656
functions. Similarly, these new studies

352
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:53,324
have shown that animal development is

353
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:56,924
incomplete without symbionts. Symbionts

354
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,876
also constitute a second mode of genetic

355
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:01,436
inheritance providing selectable genetic

356
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,872
variation for natural selection which

357
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:06,156
connects it to the evolutionary concept

358
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:08,576
of an individual. So if we pursue the

359
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,448
metabolic oh, it's all the metabolic

360
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,816
networks and how they're all connected.

361
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,196
That's the individual. All right. Well,

362
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:15,716
that includes the microbiome and

363
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,904
symbionts. Well, no, it's the physiology

364
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:19,316
and the decision making and the

365
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,924
neurophysiology. Those are also in play

366
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:24,024
with the symbionts. Well, at least

367
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,948
evolution only selects upon the germ

368
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,904
line, right? Well, no, actually there

369
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:30,696
are these multiple mechanisms of

370
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,988
inheritance whether they're relevant in

371
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:35,976
a given situation or not is situational.

372
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,936
But in principle they exist and they're

373
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,860
increasingly coming to be recognized.

374
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,956
Additionally for the immune system

375
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,484
commonly described as quote, self versus

376
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,672
non self or self identification or self

377
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:51,104
other discrimination. After all, we talk

378
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:54,140
about autografting and allografting.

379
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,288
But of course there are aspects of

380
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,772
quote, self or self under some

381
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:02,116
definitions like an epitope from a

382
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:05,376
protein in cartilage that an autoimmune

383
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:08,128
disorder might target. So the immune

384
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:11,704
system is mobilized against self under

385
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:14,344
some definitions sometime and is not

386
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:16,952
mobilized against other under some

387
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,944
definitions sometimes. Like we're not

388
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,888
constantly mounting a massive immune

389
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:25,336
response to our gut microbiome. Our skin

390
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:29,496
microbiome, recognizing the holobiont,

391
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:32,044
the multicellular Eukaryote, plus its

392
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,476
colonies of persistent symbionts as a

393
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,156
critically important unit of anatomy,

394
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,016
development, physiology, immunology and

395
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,552
evolution and cognition, opens up a new

396
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,564
investigative avenue and conceptually

397
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,536
challenges the ways in which the

398
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,564
biological subdisciplines have

399
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:49,652
heretofore characterized living

400
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:52,676
entities. Here we have the COVID of the

401
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,268
famous work Leviathan. It's a large

402
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:58,388
person constituted of other people

403
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,616
really making the point clear. But if we

404
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,632
zoomed in on, quote, an individual

405
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,400
person wouldn't we find something like

406
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,936
societies of cells? What is an

407
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,784
individual? When is an individual?

408
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:15,470
What and what's on the line?

409
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,420
I thought those are such big questions.

410
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,516
Maybe could we connect it to a little

411
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:24,156
bit of more of a bibliographic piece of

412
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:26,704
data just to show a snapshot and to open

413
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:30,064
up this discussion to you all about

414
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:31,936
what's on the line with what's an

415
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,184
individual. And so what I did is I

416
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:37,136
searched for some literature trends on

417
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,924
PubMed and here is the results per

418
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:41,696
100,000 citations for collective

419
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,096
behavior. And so we see collective

420
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,068
behavior first being mentioned in the

421
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:47,872
1950s, at least in this literature

422
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:51,140
database, and rising up on through

423
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,776
around 500 or 400 or 500 per hundred

424
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,968
thousand. So 1000 out of 100,000 would

425
00:18:56,974 --> 00:19:01,384
be 1%. So half of a percent of

426
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:04,096
all the citations on a major biolytic

427
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:07,724
literature database had

428
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:10,556
collective behavior in them. So that's a

429
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:12,236
huge amount of work, and it looks like

430
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:14,396
it goes down. But when you actually look

431
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:15,896
at how many citations there are, it's

432
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:19,010
been about 4000 publications per year.

433
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,184
It's just that the rest of the

434
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:23,168
literature database may be expanding at

435
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:25,468
a faster rate. So thousands of papers

436
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:27,904
per year and an appreciable fraction of

437
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,304
work has to do with collective behavior.

438
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:33,552
And so I thought, wow, that's exciting,

439
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,884
that's great. Well, how are we doing

440
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:37,456
compared to behavior? Now, collective

441
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:40,224
behavior is this lower line in red.

442
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,480
And yeah, there's a Blip, but behavior

443
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,272
is up between 15 and 20% of

444
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:50,932
citations in PubMed. Now, maybe behavior

445
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:54,108
is also referring to the behavior of a

446
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:56,268
given material that may or may not be a

447
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:58,060
superconductor or might be using

448
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,380
different understandings of behavior.

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,208
But what can we say and what can we know

450
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,856
about the difference between individual

451
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,272
and collective behavior? Now,

452
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:13,328
interestingly, here I searched for

453
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:16,140
individual behavior as a specific term,

454
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,384
so we see a lot lower. But individual

455
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:21,984
behavior, I mean, can the tide

456
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,276
have already turned? Can it really be

457
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,444
the case that after 2020, this is a real

458
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:29,616
meaningful decline? I don't know. It's

459
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,684
too early to say. We can't do technical

460
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,992
analysis just like that, but very

461
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,936
provocative and gives us some ways to

462
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,492
look at the broader scale or collective

463
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:41,780
scientific cognitive process associated

464
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,470
with these incredibly important

465
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,992
philosophical and biological

466
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:50,444
questions about individuality. Because,

467
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,264
of course, to distinguish collective

468
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:55,004
behavior from individual behavior, or

469
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:57,136
why would you even need an adjective at

470
00:20:57,158 --> 00:20:59,008
all? It's going to come down to what is

471
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:01,664
an individual and what's on the line so

472
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,850
much. And the last view here,

473
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,336
drawing upon the work morphology of

474
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,044
collective intelligence network, swarm,

475
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,316
multitude, or assemblage? And Tony

476
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:15,216
Devorrow and Alejandro Lopez Gabrielis

477
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:19,284
wrote, network, swarm and multitude are

478
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:20,516
some of the different metaphors that

479
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:22,116
have been used to understand the concept

480
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,264
of collective intelligence. All of them

481
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:25,736
have reflected our relationship with the

482
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:28,936
Internet and its development. With the

483
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,320
advent of artificial intelligence AI,

484
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,548
we wonder about other metaphors that

485
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:37,084
might offer a new understanding of

486
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,452
collective intelligence to address

487
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,688
today's environmental and sociotechnical

488
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:45,124
challenges. They bring up network,

489
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:48,256
swarm and multitude to advocate for

490
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:50,716
the fourth option assemblage.

491
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,576
Understanding collective intelligence as

492
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:54,652
an assemblage allows for the inclusion

493
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,764
of different human and technological

494
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:58,324
agents and overcomes the

495
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:01,972
anthropocentrism human centrism human

496
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:04,596
exclusionism of other models based on

497
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:06,996
human will, whether extended as in the

498
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:09,440
multitude or suppressed as in the swarm

499
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,884
connotations here. In this way, ethical

00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,144
decision making and responsibility are

501
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:16,932
distributed among different cognitive

502
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,016
actors with the capacity to choose and

503
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,576
interpret. And to the extent that they

504
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,752
make decisions, albeit algorithmic ones,

505
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,836
they are also accountable. And I love

506
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:27,676
this, and I think it foreshadows where

507
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:29,128
we're going to be going with active

508
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:32,732
inference, which is different

509
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,716
cognitive actors have the capacity to

510
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:36,672
choose and interpret. We might connect

511
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:39,296
that to sensory and internal states of

512
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:40,992
an active inference agent. But

513
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,004
perception, sense making, signal

514
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:47,010
processing inbound information and

515
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,316
decision making and responsibility and

516
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:51,872
accountability and the accountability

517
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,540
that we associate with human

518
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,764
sociotechnical systems, that's the

519
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:57,808
action selection, control theory,

520
00:22:57,904 --> 00:23:00,060
outgoing dependencies in the Markov

521
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,952
blanket. So right there, coming from

522
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,416
outside of active inference, we see the

523
00:23:05,438 --> 00:23:08,312
identification of the need to have

524
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,036
flexible frameworks, including

525
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:12,564
linguistic and metaphorical, that allow

526
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:16,632
us to talk about heterogeneous diverse

527
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:19,292
cyberphysical systems where different

528
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:21,868
entities are engaged in different

529
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:25,660
practices and ways of incoming sense

530
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,240
making and outgoing decision making.

531
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,276
And it's going to turn out that active

532
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,628
inference is an incredible and flexible

533
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:35,904
expressive framework that's going to

534
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:37,548
allow us to talk about those kinds of

535
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:40,132
systems pointed to here. And it really

536
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,732
matters. They point to some of the most

537
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:44,950
important aspects of issues today

538
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,836
on to active inference, insights and

539
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:51,016
fundamentals. Well, here, as in all the

540
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,236
other areas, there were so many pieces

541
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:54,996
of literature that could have been drawn

542
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:57,656
on. That's why I restricted myself to

543
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,480
just four views.

544
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,344
Also, this section is going to mark the

545
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:05,804
midway point. We're not there yet,

546
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,756
don't worry, but the midway point of the

547
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:09,740
lecture where we move from the six

548
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,956
declarative expressions onto the

549
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:15,036
questions because it's more open than

550
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:16,796
not and there's more space for you to

551
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:19,756
respond than you may imagine. But the

552
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:21,968
view is going to be here. And what are

553
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,808
the literature that support that point?

554
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:26,384
So, first, active inference in the free

555
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:28,412
energy principle, which is a principle

556
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:31,176
that provides a lot of theoretical

557
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,600
grounding and physics based perspective

558
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,028
on active inference. But we're not going

559
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:37,376
to go too much into it today. Active

560
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:38,848
inference and the free energy principle

561
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,012
are scale free formalisms for cognitive

562
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:44,216
systems with collectives, as with

563
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:46,584
individuals, the general framing in

564
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:49,224
itself does very little. However, with

565
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,236
properly constructed generative models,

566
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:52,804
we can get explanation, prediction,

567
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:54,712
design, influence, and implementation

568
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:57,596
tools. And here I'm going to draw on two

569
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:00,072
pieces of work epistemic Communities

570
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:02,876
under Active Inference by Mahault and

571
00:25:02,898 --> 00:25:06,020
colleagues in 2022 and just from several

572
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,016
days ago, the work by Connor Hines and

573
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,504
colleagues. Collective behavior from

574
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,848
surprise minimization. We'll unpack the

575
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:15,120
point more when we get there. Second,

576
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,932
collectives can be understood as

577
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,248
consisting of action perception loops

578
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:23,984
which subsume, entail, or supervene upon

579
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,776
individual level action perception

580
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:29,216
loops, niche modification, stigma,

581
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:32,416
g can also be modeled this way. We'll

582
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,156
draw upon the paper Active Inference,

583
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:36,856
an active inference framework for ant

584
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:38,964
colony behavior by myself and colleagues

585
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:42,296
in 2021. And then we'll move into the

586
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,832
questions and things will start to open

587
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:45,448
up. So if it feels like we've been

588
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:47,228
climbing uphill. We're two thirds of the

589
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,828
way with the uphill climb. Feels like

590
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,764
we've been going downhill. We're two

591
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:53,516
thirds of the way with a downhill how do

592
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:55,496
the concepts of generalized synchrony

593
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:57,824
and homeostasis, which are so core to

594
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,836
active inference, relate to collective

595
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:02,736
behavior? Here we'll discuss the work by

596
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:05,616
Ralph Kaufman et al. From 2021, an

597
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:07,116
active inference model of collective

598
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,548
intelligence. And lastly, in this

599
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:11,556
section, how can active inference be

600
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:13,460
used to explore the balance between

601
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,476
individual and collective behaviors and

602
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:17,124
the bi directional influence of

603
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:19,156
collectives on individuals, and, of

604
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:22,116
course, vice versa? Here we'll draw upon

605
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:24,232
the computational boundary of a self

606
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:26,356
developmental bioelectricity drives,

607
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:28,312
multicellularity and scale free

608
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:31,400
cognition by Mike Levin in 2019.

609
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,932
So let's get right into the work by

610
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:36,060
Mahault and Connor and colleagues.

611
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,484
First, I'm just going to bring this

612
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:43,356
paper up. However, first you

613
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:45,624
can watch more about it in Guest stream

614
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,528
17.1 from March 2022.

615
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:51,584
Here's two collectives right here. And

616
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:54,320
also Mahault will be covering this work

617
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,496
in a lot more detail later on in the

618
00:26:56,518 --> 00:26:57,648
course. I just wanted to bring it up

619
00:26:57,654 --> 00:26:58,644
because I think it's one of the

620
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,316
exceptional examples that can be

621
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:03,492
deployed to show like, hey, just

622
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:05,936
thinking about the social as an active

623
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:08,276
inference system is awesome. It's an

624
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:10,676
intuition pump. It brings us into the

625
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:12,216
active inference ecosystem. But then

626
00:27:12,238 --> 00:27:14,248
what do we do when we're there? And what

627
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:16,360
we do when we're there is we develop

628
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,056
generative models that actually take us

629
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,170
towards where we want to be.

630
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,532
Again, framing a situation as

631
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:29,196
being related to active inference. Or

632
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:30,652
you could do an active inference model

633
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:34,076
of that does very, very little work

634
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:36,972
by itself. However, making generative

635
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:39,596
models of situations, even if they're

636
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,104
speculative generative models or

637
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:44,112
qualitative or hypothetical, that can

638
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,576
start getting towards doing work. But if

639
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,224
someone said, well, that health

640
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:49,436
condition, you could do a linear

641
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,596
regression. Okay, but which treatment do

642
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:54,148
we do? Well, it could be done with a

643
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:55,856
linear regression. We could use a linear

644
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:58,004
regression to figure out what method to

645
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:01,696
use. Okay, but more or less hotter

646
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,280
room or colder room. Well, just use a

647
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,576
linear regression. So that's the

648
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:06,776
conversation that we're having a lot

649
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,952
with active inference. A lot of times

650
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:10,712
people are talking about whether a given

651
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,856
situation can or cannot be modeled with

652
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:15,084
active inference. Or, just in the

653
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:16,876
abstract, what does active inference say

654
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:19,436
about this situation? And again, the

655
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,612
framework itself is general to the point

656
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,076
of doing little work, and we love it

657
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:27,488
that way. It enables us to move into

658
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,836
systems of interest and deploy

659
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:31,856
generative models. So what they did in

660
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,948
this paper was leverage the active

661
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,096
inference framework to provide an in

662
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:39,010
silicon model on the computer chip model

663
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,764
of confirmation bias and its effect on

664
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:43,956
echo chamber formation. They had a

665
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:46,020
system of interest people's social

666
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,132
engagement on so called social media,

667
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:50,196
and they had even a phenomena of

668
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:51,476
interest which was echo chamber

669
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,456
formation. They built a model based on

670
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:56,216
active inference where agents tend to

671
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:58,388
sample information in order to justify

672
00:28:58,484 --> 00:29:00,696
their own view of reality, something we

673
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:03,352
call self evidencing. We show that once

674
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:05,116
agents have reached a certain level of

675
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:06,716
certainty about their beliefs, it

676
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:08,556
becomes very difficult to get them to

677
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:11,644
change their views. The system of self

678
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:13,388
confirming beliefs is upheld and

679
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,244
reinforced by the evolving relationship

680
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:16,876
between an agent's beliefs and

681
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:19,712
observations, which will, over time,

682
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:21,616
will continue to provide evidence for

683
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,970
their ingrained ideas about the world.

684
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,896
Well, where I'm from, we drive on the

685
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:29,184
right side of the road and so you drive

686
00:29:29,222 --> 00:29:30,464
on the right side of the road, I drive

687
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,900
on the right side of the road. We're not

688
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,636
going to have an issue. Everywhere I

689
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:35,556
look, I see cars moving around, I see

690
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:36,916
people passing on the right, on the

691
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:39,008
sidewalk. It's all making sense. We're

692
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,976
bounding surprise. We're doing active

693
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:42,680
inference. Surprising minimization

694
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,384
goals, reward never need to come into

695
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:48,360
play to give an account of how those

696
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,880
systems could arise and be stabilized.

697
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,052
These epistemic communities are

698
00:29:55,106 --> 00:29:57,644
consolidated by those shared beliefs and

699
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:59,676
in turn tend to produce perceptions of

700
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:02,136
reality that reinforce those shared

701
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:05,888
beliefs. And on the top right is just a

702
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:08,812
little teaser of what a Bayesian

703
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:11,472
graphical model looks like of the kind

704
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:14,050
that they deployed in this paper.

705
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,876
And here we see some of the results from

706
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,176
their parameter sweeping, exploring

707
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,532
different combinations of parameters and

708
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:26,528
looking at topics like polarization

709
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,984
index and reattenance rate and

710
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:33,256
so all kinds of statistics that can be

711
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:35,604
drawn upon, connected to the generative

712
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:38,136
model and also all kinds of

713
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:41,524
opportunities and interfaces to relate

714
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:44,428
this to empirical data as well as

715
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,668
suggest experiments. So Mahault is going

716
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:48,092
to talk more about this and it's awesome

717
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:52,188
work. And then late breaking news only

718
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:54,956
several days ago, five or so days ago,

719
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:57,264
an amazing new pre [unk]print was put up

720
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:00,256
by Connor Hines and colleagues and it

721
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:02,544
was just too cool not to include here

722
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:05,472
and reflects the very rapid pace of

723
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:07,388
collaborative development in the active

724
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:09,524
inference ecosystem. And this is their

725
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:11,424
work collective behavior from surprise

726
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:14,452
minimization. And they made every point

727
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,510
I wanted to make here and now.

728
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,376
Collective motion is ubiquitous in

729
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,716
nature. Typically, such macroscopic

730
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,912
patterns arise from decentralized local

731
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:27,956
interactions among constituent

732
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,048
components e. G, individual fish in a

733
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:32,940
school there's that word individual

734
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,428
again. Preeminent models of this process

735
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:39,176
describe individuals as self propelled

736
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,144
particles, subject to self generated

737
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,644
motion and social forces such as short

738
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,484
range repulsion and long range

739
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:47,040
attraction or alignment.

740
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,628
However, organisms are not particles.

741
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:54,320
They are probabilistic decision makers.

742
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,716
They're cognitive particles. We

743
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,248
introduce an approach to modeling

744
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:00,688
collective behavior based on active

745
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:03,456
inference. This cognitive framework

746
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:06,036
casts behavior as the consequence of a

747
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,980
single imperative to minimize surprise.

748
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,924
Again, if you want to, you can contrast

749
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,536
that with reward learning, where the

750
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,096
imperative is to maximize reward in

751
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:18,552
active inference and the free energy

752
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:21,080
principle. We're taking a path of least

753
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,704
action not the laziest path or the most

754
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,724
passive one, but a little bit more

755
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:28,220
technically a path of least action.

756
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,256
And we're minimizing surprise. We're

757
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:33,004
bounding surprise with variational free

758
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,936
energy and it turns out that that helps

759
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:37,472
us minimize surprise and maximize model

760
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:39,504
evidence. And it can include things like

761
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,744
novelty and curiosity seeking very

762
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:43,196
naturally. So this doesn't mean we're

763
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,450
squeezing the juice out of life at all.

764
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,424
We demonstrate that many empirically

765
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,776
observed collective phenomena including

766
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,192
cohesion milling and directed motion

767
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:55,824
emerge naturally when considering

768
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:57,824
behavior as driven by active Bayesian

769
00:32:57,872 --> 00:33:00,840
inference without explicitly building

770
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,952
behavioral rules or goals into

771
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:07,028
individual agents. No reward,

772
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,916
no goal, no master of the collective.

773
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:13,076
Furthermore, we show that active

774
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:14,876
inference can recover and generalize the

775
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:17,132
classical notion of social forces as

776
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,144
agents attempt to suppress prediction

777
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:21,164
errors that conflict with their

778
00:33:21,202 --> 00:33:23,656
expectations. By exploring the parameter

779
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:25,596
space of the beliefbased model we reveal

780
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,136
nontrivial relationships between the

781
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:29,212
individual beliefs and group properties

782
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:32,576
like polarization and the tendency to

783
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:34,864
visit different collective states. We

784
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:37,356
also explore how individual beliefs

785
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:40,416
about uncertainty, metacognition beliefs

786
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:43,024
about beliefs determine collective

787
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:46,196
decision making accuracy. What if when

788
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:48,116
you voted or shared your perspective on

789
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:49,520
what we were going to have for dinner

790
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,860
you also conveyed an uncertainty

791
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,976
estimate? How confident are you about

792
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:55,530
that being the case?

793
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,908
Finally, we show how agents can update

794
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:01,448
their generative model over time

795
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:02,716
resulting in groups that are

796
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:05,256
collectively more sensitive to external

797
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:07,276
fluctuations and encode information more

798
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:10,104
robustly. From a distributed systems

799
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:12,284
perspective you could imagine two

800
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:14,088
different kinds of distributed systems

801
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:17,388
or networks. One of them has a dampening

802
00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:20,716
like quality. So something that enters

803
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:24,880
on one side dampens as it diffuses.

804
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,184
We can also contrast that with another

805
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:28,624
kind of distributed system or another

806
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:30,576
kind of input or stimulus or context

807
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:34,144
that amplifies. And the goal

808
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:36,416
or one nice property to have of systems

809
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,316
would be like we want to dampen what we

810
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:42,760
don't want to pay attention to and up

811
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,508
signal or increase the cascading

812
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,464
availability of what we do want to

813
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,844
attend to. Now that's a little circular

814
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,124
since in some ways that's the definition

815
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,456
of attention. However, making unified

816
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:57,404
models like they do here gives us

817
00:34:57,522 --> 00:35:00,888
integrated approaches to explore

818
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:03,848
a broad range of collective phenomena

819
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:06,752
here in spatial movement but also

820
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:08,368
involving the cognitive states of the

821
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:10,832
particles. And they make a really nice

822
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:12,864
representation here to connect to other

823
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,712
approaches. A traditional approach to

824
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:17,792
classical self propelled particles is

825
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:21,556
agent environment. Agents take rules and

826
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,076
they make decisions based upon those

827
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:25,060
rules that are either given or learnt.

828
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,404
When you're this close to the bird next

829
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:30,016
to you, do that and when you're this

830
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:33,092
close, do this. And then social forces

831
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:36,490
are these kind of as if or actual

832
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,356
constraints that then modify the agent's

833
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,776
perspective. And what we see in the

834
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:44,936
active inference setting is that the

835
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,976
agent and the environment are mediated

836
00:35:48,088 --> 00:35:51,368
by an interface. The Markov blanket.

837
00:35:51,464 --> 00:35:54,364
This is. The sensorium. This is on the

838
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,956
inbound side perception and on the

839
00:35:56,978 --> 00:36:00,624
outbound side action. And they give

840
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:01,904
some more details. It's a really

841
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:04,144
exciting paper and it's just cool to see

842
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:06,512
again that even in the preparatory days

843
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:09,172
of a lecture like this, there's always

844
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:11,712
new collective activity in the ecosystem

845
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:13,190
and that's what makes it fun.

846
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,216
Last of the declarative sections of this

847
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:23,672
lecture. Colonies here,

848
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,136
but more generally collectives, can be

849
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:27,956
understood as consisting of action

850
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:30,244
perception loops which subsume, entail

851
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,612
or supervene upon individual level

852
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:35,176
action perception loops, niche

853
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:38,076
modifications or stigma. G can also be

854
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:41,452
modeled this way. What we did in this

855
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:44,684
paper was bring something new

856
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:46,864
to active inference in at least two

857
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:50,752
different ways. First, it was the first

858
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:53,904
model of an ant system of interest.

859
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:56,016
Now, for some of us mere mycologists in

860
00:36:56,038 --> 00:36:57,996
the audience, all of our broader

861
00:36:58,028 --> 00:37:00,036
entomology colleagues, that may be

862
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,924
enough. But what was also really

863
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:03,796
interesting about this work and the

864
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:06,308
opportunity to collaborate on it, was it

865
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:08,388
was the first active inference model

866
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:11,816
presented with explicit stigmaji. Not

867
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,456
just the philosophical consideration of

868
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,536
the traces that agents leaving in the

869
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:19,864
environment might then have them change

870
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:21,624
their behavior in the future, but

871
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:24,408
explicitly engaging with this process of

872
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,020
multiagent stigmurgic behavior.

873
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,556
Active inference may be informative in

874
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,172
the study of ant colonies at three

875
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:34,904
distinct temporal scales. Nest mate

876
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,268
behavior, which is to say emergent among

877
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:39,936
tissues of a nest mate, you could keep

878
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,112
on going collectively down and

879
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,396
interactions with the biotic or abiotic

880
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,416
environment. So, first level at the

881
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,484
level of a nest mate, one of those

882
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:50,436
things with six legs that looks like an

883
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,780
insect, at the level of the colony,

884
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,736
colony development is emergent among

885
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:58,356
nest mates and their interactions with

886
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,900
the niche. That is where many people

887
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,816
would traditionally assign collective

888
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:05,476
behavior. They say, well, one nest mate

889
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:07,684
walking around is individual behavior,

890
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:10,104
that's the individual ants. And then the

891
00:38:10,142 --> 00:38:11,956
colony is where collective behavior

892
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:13,708
comes into play, right? And we're going

893
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:16,844
to see that reified very soon. But

894
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:18,796
lastly, we point to the evolution of

895
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,376
populations, which is an emergent

896
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:22,316
outcome amongst colonies within an

897
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:26,016
ecology. In this work, we focused on the

898
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,388
connection between the first two levels

899
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:30,096
of analysis, focusing on the case of

900
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:32,768
stigmergic colony foraging using a

901
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:34,268
modification of previous active

902
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:36,400
inference computational implementations.

903
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,484
We didn't use the word individual and

904
00:38:40,522 --> 00:38:44,304
there's a reason why. Because we're

905
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:46,932
saying what we mean more clearly when

906
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:49,332
talking about ants, when we talk about

907
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:52,484
nest mates, colonies and populations of

908
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:55,544
colonies that sidesteps or

909
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,336
transcends the discussion of what is an

910
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:58,964
individual and what is a collective.

911
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:00,824
Because with respect to the colony as an

912
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:02,536
individual, if you want to use that

913
00:39:02,558 --> 00:39:04,532
word, the population is a collective

914
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:06,156
with respect to the nest mate, the

915
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:09,020
colony is a collective. With respect to

916
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,644
the tissue like the brain or the mid

917
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,700
gut, the nest mate is a collective. So

918
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,724
we don't need to play the adjective

919
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,116
game. We can just articulate what we're

920
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,344
interested in about these systems of

921
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:23,472
interest and complex adaptive system

922
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:26,704
phenomena. And so what we did was we

923
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,736
explored a kind of classical behavioral

924
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,160
setting which is food being placed

925
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,076
between the arms of a teammates and in

926
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:36,900
this case, rather than a rat.

927
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,256
I'm just pausing for a second while I

928
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:45,364
believe that my internet

929
00:39:45,412 --> 00:39:48,010
is reconnecting and we should be back.

930
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,716
Each ant was described by an action

931
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:56,104
perception loop, an active inference

932
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,124
action perception loop. And they were

933
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,524
able to move within a three by three

934
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:03,336
grid as well as perceive pheromone

935
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,496
density within a three by three grid.

936
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:08,124
And then they laid down pheromone, they

937
00:40:08,162 --> 00:40:11,424
added stigmaergic trace on the way home

938
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,544
if they had found a seed. And so this

939
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:16,272
does a few interesting things and

940
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:19,408
livestream 29 is where we unpack this a

941
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:20,868
lot more. But I just wanted to make two

942
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,716
more points here. The first is that in a

943
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:26,324
reward centric perspective on ant

944
00:40:26,362 --> 00:40:29,236
behavior, the pheromone is seen as a

945
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:32,660
semiotic queue and the seed or the food

946
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,256
is seen as the reward. And so then we

947
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:36,856
got to use the cues, we got to use the

948
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:38,616
pheromone density to figure out where

949
00:40:38,638 --> 00:40:41,080
the good stuff is. That's that paradigm.

950
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,264
We flipped that with active inference.

951
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:47,004
Now, the preference we don't need to say

952
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,844
reward, but the preference, that which

953
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:51,644
is sought after proximally but

954
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,708
teleologically, that which is sought

955
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:58,000
after preferred over is the pheromone.

956
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,256
The seed becomes the semiotic cue that

957
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:03,916
it's time to turn on your pheromone

958
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:07,648
depositing and come home. And so that

959
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:11,204
flips our approach to understanding what

960
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:14,788
foraging is about from we're lost in the

961
00:41:14,794 --> 00:41:16,708
sauce, trying to figure out where the

962
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:19,776
good thing is out there to we're surfing

963
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:22,608
the 100 foot wave and we'll know it when

964
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,410
we see it, and then we'll turn around.

965
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,984
Very different perspective. And then one

966
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:29,256
other point that I had to make for the

967
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,304
context was that we used a modification

968
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:33,864
of a previous active inference

969
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:37,310
computational implementation. What was

970
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,510
the paper that we drew from?

971
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,084
In fact, it was the acquisition of

972
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:44,984
culturally patterned attention styles

973
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,012
under active inference with Axel and

974
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:52,192
Alex et al. And what this paper did was

975
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:55,244
they looked at the situation of visual

976
00:41:55,372 --> 00:41:59,396
foraging on

977
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:02,528
a vase, a piece of pottery,

978
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:05,024
where the eye was only able to perceive

979
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:09,220
a three by three matrix of pixels.

980
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,888
And then the eye scanned around looking

981
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:15,576
to recognize broader patterns that were

982
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,600
then culturally acquired. So maybe one

983
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,048
culture or one subculture likes the

984
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:23,244
checkerboard pattern and another one

985
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,776
likes vertical lines, another one likes

986
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,876
horizontal lines or these other kinds of

987
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:30,924
repetitive structures. What's so

988
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:34,220
interesting is that the eye, when it is

989
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,388
foraging, does not leave a trace,

990
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:39,680
though it can feel like it, doesn't it?

991
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,328
But the eye forges around in order to

992
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,792
get the bigger picture based on local

993
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:49,056
information. What we did is we said,

994
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:50,516
well, instead of imagining that as the

995
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:53,536
gaze location of an eye. Let's imagine

996
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:56,464
that as the skin in the game exoskeleton

997
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:59,808
on the ground of a forager. So let's

998
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:02,264
think about that movement as something

999
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:04,744
that an embodied forager does with its

1000
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,100
real body and then conditional

1001
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,376
in this setting upon it touching the

1002
00:43:10,398 --> 00:43:12,648
seed or the food, it can lay down a

1003
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:15,368
pheromone trail, which the eyes can't do

1004
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:17,900
per se. And so just really interesting

1005
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,492
because it's not like this was an ant

1006
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:22,728
paper and now we're going to try to cram

1007
00:43:22,744 --> 00:43:24,604
it into social sciences. It's actually

1008
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:28,048
like computational work in the social

1009
00:43:28,134 --> 00:43:30,896
sciences was able to translate to

1010
00:43:30,918 --> 00:43:34,256
Mirmacology into ants research. And so

1011
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,316
it's a very fruitful and bi directional

1012
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:39,156
relationship between studying ants and

1013
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:40,150
studying people.

1014
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,796
Now we're going to move into the

1015
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:46,212
openness of questions in this second

1016
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:49,524
half of the lecture. So how

1017
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:51,248
do the concepts of generalized synchrony

1018
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:53,016
and homeostasis, which are core to

1019
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:54,596
active inference, relate to collective

1020
00:43:54,628 --> 00:43:57,736
behavior? And here we can draw upon the

1021
00:43:57,758 --> 00:44:00,248
work by Ralph Kaufman, Pranav Gupta and

1022
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:03,360
Jacob Taylor from 2021 called inactive

1023
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,616
inference model of collective

1024
00:44:04,648 --> 00:44:06,536
intelligence. And this was also unpacked

1025
00:44:06,568 --> 00:44:09,436
in Gestream Nine. And so here's a little

1026
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:12,332
collective over here. And that was about

1027
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:17,824
two years ago, way back when what

1028
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,504
they did in this paper was they

1029
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,636
considered a setting with two trolley

1030
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:26,640
cars moving around a wheel.

1031
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,376
And so here's how they contextualize

1032
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:31,776
that work. Formal models of collective

1033
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:33,136
intelligence have lacked a plausible

1034
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:34,596
mathematical description of the

1035
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:36,224
relationship between local scale

1036
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:38,304
interactions between autonomous

1037
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:41,752
subsystem components individuals and

1038
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:43,764
global scale behavior of the composite

1039
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:46,008
system, the collective. So they do a

1040
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:48,264
really great job staking out what they

1041
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:51,080
mean by individual and collective.

1042
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,336
In this paper, we use the active

1043
00:44:53,368 --> 00:44:57,080
inference formulation AIF, a framework

1044
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,808
for explaining the behavior of any non

1045
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:00,764
equilibrium steady state system at any

1046
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:04,044
scale deposit, a minimal agent based

1047
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,488
model that simulates the relationship

1048
00:45:05,574 --> 00:45:07,552
between local individual level

1049
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:09,600
interaction and collective intelligence.

1050
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,492
Then they had a really creative approach

1051
00:45:12,636 --> 00:45:15,776
to disentangling how different

1052
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:18,964
capacities translated to different

1053
00:45:19,002 --> 00:45:20,228
collective outcomes. And here's what

1054
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,396
they did. We explore the effects of

1055
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:25,760
providing baseline active inference

1056
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,068
agents. Model one with specific

1057
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:30,020
cognitive capabilities,

1058
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,330
model two added in a theory of mind,

1059
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,628
model three added in goal alignment,

1060
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:41,880
and model four added both theory of mind

1061
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,664
and goal alignment. What does that look

1062
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:46,476
like? Again, we're not going to go into

1063
00:45:46,498 --> 00:45:48,364
all the technical details here, but

1064
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:50,044
broadly, this is what it looked like.

1065
00:45:50,162 --> 00:45:52,776
Here was their simplest baseline active

1066
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:55,856
inference formulation case. And then in

1067
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,756
the subsequent experiments, they added

1068
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:01,776
in either one or the other or both of

1069
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:03,216
the cognitive capacities that they

1070
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:06,992
described. They studied the

1071
00:46:07,046 --> 00:46:11,430
single DIAD case and

1072
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,060
they very cleverly expanded that into

1073
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,192
a large scale multidiad

1074
00:46:18,256 --> 00:46:22,848
case. They utilized

1075
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:25,916
their own representation of the octave

1076
00:46:25,968 --> 00:46:29,784
inference partition in order to

1077
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:31,816
facilitate the construction of this

1078
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:34,188
model. And so in this case, we see the

1079
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:35,676
blanket with the sensory states coming

1080
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:38,216
in, the active states going out. Markov

1081
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:42,536
blanket. Here we see the environment

1082
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:45,264
and then internal belief states or

1083
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,152
cognitive states. So very

1084
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:53,344
cool work that helps us get

1085
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:56,880
a vocabulary around, not shut the book

1086
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,670
on, but focus on.

1087
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,604
How do different agents come to

1088
00:47:03,642 --> 00:47:06,032
synchronize? What is generalized

1089
00:47:06,096 --> 00:47:07,444
synchrony? Well, it doesn't mean

1090
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:10,484
Lockstep turntaking is generalized

1091
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,888
synchrony, because these two agents,

1092
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:15,432
the time that they're talking, has very

1093
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:18,408
high mutual information on the other,

1094
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:21,016
even though the correlation with their

1095
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,516
speaking might be negative, agent A is

1096
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:25,656
speaking when B is not, and vice versa.

1097
00:47:25,768 --> 00:47:28,488
So from a linear regression perspective,

1098
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,956
there's a negative correlation. But from

1099
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:34,156
a mutual information perspective, where

1100
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:36,560
you can't ever have below zero

1101
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,840
information, at worst it's just noise.

1102
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,144
You always have zero or positive amount

1103
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:47,024
of information of systems about other

1104
00:47:47,062 --> 00:47:49,876
systems. And so that opens the door to

1105
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:51,968
understanding generalized synchrony,

1106
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:54,452
which is a broader conception of how

1107
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:57,284
individuals and collectives are

1108
00:47:57,322 --> 00:47:59,908
interacting. And homeostasis. Maybe we

1109
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:01,648
could even imagine that these are

1110
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,848
multiple cells in the pancreas and

1111
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:05,988
they're trying to coordinate on insulin

1112
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,404
sensitivity. Or maybe this is multiple

1113
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,336
people who are securing the defense of a

1114
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:12,716
community and they also need to

1115
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,188
coordinate synchronously and

1116
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:16,332
asynchronously. And so there's a lot of

1117
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:19,500
ways in which this very, very

1118
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,168
lightweight apparatus of the active

1119
00:48:22,184 --> 00:48:25,580
inference partition helps us bring

1120
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,804
together and compose all these cool.

1121
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,936
What ifs? Well, what if it had theory of

1122
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,332
mind? What if it had goal alignment?

1123
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,464
What if agents had theory of mind and

1124
00:48:34,502 --> 00:48:37,860
goal alignment? What if we put them in a

1125
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,996
five x seven grid and then we did this

1126
00:48:41,178 --> 00:48:44,596
and and that's what we get to do with

1127
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:47,990
active inference. And lastly here,

1128
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,664
how can active inference be used to

1129
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:52,376
explore the balance between individual

1130
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:54,504
and collective behavioral and the bi

1131
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:56,696
directional influence of collectives on

1132
00:48:56,718 --> 00:49:00,392
individuals? And so here I draw upon the

1133
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:03,176
amazing and singular work of Professor

1134
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,672
Mike Levin, who wrote the computational

1135
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:07,736
boundary of a self developmental

1136
00:49:07,768 --> 00:49:09,896
bioelectricity drives multicellularity

1137
00:49:09,928 --> 00:49:13,036
and scale free cognition in 2019. This

1138
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:15,804
was also explored in Livestream 25

1139
00:49:15,842 --> 00:49:18,576
series. So, just to pull out a few of

1140
00:49:18,598 --> 00:49:21,440
the great pieces of this article, and

1141
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,536
there's a stigmaic trail of many other

1142
00:49:23,558 --> 00:49:25,010
papers for those who follow,

1143
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,156
professor Levin writes, I propose a

1144
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:32,324
definition of an individual based on its

1145
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:35,604
information processing structure. The

1146
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:37,652
scale and types of goals that a system

1147
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:40,196
can pursue, defines or determines the

1148
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:41,736
boundaries and the content of the

1149
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:45,032
putative agent. On this view,

1150
00:49:45,086 --> 00:49:47,032
what defines a coherent, unified self

1151
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,256
out of its constituents, components and

1152
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,776
the surrounding environment is the set

1153
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,864
of parts that operate towards reaching

1154
00:49:52,932 --> 00:49:56,604
specific goal states. So this is

1155
00:49:56,642 --> 00:49:59,404
a teleological or a functional or

1156
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:02,812
anticipatory or sentient or adaptive or

1157
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,996
informational concept on individuals,

1158
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:08,924
which we can add to the earlier

1159
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:12,770
consideration raised by Gilbert et al.

1160
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,832
Here they discuss some of the more

1161
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,972
mechanistic biological considerations

1162
00:50:17,036 --> 00:50:18,960
like genetics, immunology, evolution,

1163
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,860
development, anatomy, and physiology.

1164
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,304
What Levin has done here, and consistent

1165
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:28,432
with this, is the informational theory

1166
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:31,488
of individuality by David Krakauer et

1167
00:50:31,504 --> 00:50:35,176
al. Is connect this more generally to

1168
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:39,336
system capacity. And so there is what is

1169
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:42,200
here represented as like a time diamond,

1170
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,036
where the scope or the scale of the

1171
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:48,840
system in the now is like the radius

1172
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,500
or the circumference on this diamond.

1173
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,396
And then the part of the diamond that

1174
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,316
recedes off into the past, that's

1175
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:59,552
retained from the past, is memory and

1176
00:50:59,606 --> 00:51:03,520
history. And the part that advances or

1177
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:07,532
pretends into the future is the

1178
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,260
anticipatory or the planning capacity.

1179
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,832
This opens the door to describing

1180
00:51:12,976 --> 00:51:15,744
diverse intelligences, including

1181
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:18,176
possible alien artificial intelligence

1182
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,048
or synthetic intelligences, as well as

1183
00:51:21,214 --> 00:51:24,104
nested or compound intelligences. So

1184
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:27,364
here the example is the ant colony.

1185
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:30,250
So here we have cells, these little

1186
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,624
pinkish diamonds nested

1187
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:38,300
within a nest mate,

1188
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,332
which is the green diamond nested within

1189
00:51:42,386 --> 00:51:44,440
the colony, which is the blue diamond.

1190
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,184
Now, notice that the nest mate is called

1191
00:51:47,222 --> 00:51:50,736
an organism. I couldn't help but to

1192
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:54,384
connect this to Wheeler 1911, whose work

1193
00:51:54,422 --> 00:51:57,052
is the Ant Colony as an organism.

1194
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:59,604
Superorganism came later. The

1195
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:02,532
superorganismal framing on the ant

1196
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:06,404
colony reifies the concept that

1197
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:08,516
the nest mate is the individual or the

1198
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:10,628
organism, because why else would you

1199
00:52:10,634 --> 00:52:12,752
need to call the colony a superorganism?

1200
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:14,936
I mean, I think colonies are super. I

1201
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,072
think it's great to call them whatever

1202
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:17,656
you want to call them, and they probably

1203
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:20,008
don't mind either. But the idea that a

1204
00:52:20,014 --> 00:52:22,504
superorganism is composed of other

1205
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,468
organisms means that the nest mate is an

1206
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:27,724
organism. Whereas this diagram, in my

1207
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:30,076
perspective, would be as accurate or

1208
00:52:30,098 --> 00:52:32,636
more to say nest mate here, because

1209
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:34,652
under different concepts of

1210
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:36,464
organismality, which is to say

1211
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:38,416
individuality, if we want to connect it

1212
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:41,008
there, the colony can be considered as

1213
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:41,920
the organism.

1214
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,072
And of the so many other pieces of this

1215
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:49,924
work that are fun to bring out, the way

1216
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:54,180
that Levin clarifies his assumptions

1217
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,036
gives us, first off, some planks that we

1218
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:02,180
can jump off of for good and helps us

1219
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,296
come to terms with maybe like, what do

1220
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:06,504
we assume about behavior, about

1221
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:08,568
collective behavior? How do we want to

1222
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:10,276
show up when we're studying collective

1223
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:12,244
behavior in general and when we're

1224
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,696
studying social behavior? After all,

1225
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:16,732
we're in active inference for the social

1226
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:20,216
sciences. And so Levin writes, the ideas

1227
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:21,736
are explored here from the perspective

1228
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:23,900
of the following three core assumptions.

1229
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,876
First is a commitment to evolution.

1230
00:53:26,988 --> 00:53:28,864
Every capacity has a natural history and

1231
00:53:28,902 --> 00:53:31,808
emerged from simpler variants. Second,

1232
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:33,696
it is assumed that all metaphors are to

1233
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:35,612
be judged by their utility in driving

1234
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:38,148
scientific progress. There is not a

1235
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:40,432
binary categorization of scientific

1236
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:42,544
pictures which should be taken literally

1237
00:53:42,592 --> 00:53:45,696
or not, which can be decided a priori

1238
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:49,456
upfront. Third, much of the discussion

1239
00:53:49,488 --> 00:53:51,716
centers around goals related to

1240
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:54,532
teleology. A hotly debated topic here,

1241
00:53:54,586 --> 00:53:56,116
goal directedness is taken in the

1242
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:58,776
nonmagical cybernetic engineering and

1243
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:00,436
control theory sense of a feedback

1244
00:54:00,468 --> 00:54:02,344
system that operates to maximize some

1245
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:05,148
specific state of affairs, which can be

1246
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:06,716
modeled as a dynamical system with

1247
00:54:06,738 --> 00:54:09,020
attractors in its state space. And later

1248
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,908
work by Levin and Fields and others

1249
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,872
expanded this concept of intelligence

1250
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:16,620
just to phenomenal heights and flavors.

1251
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,448
So active inference helps us understand

1252
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:24,156
that cognitive glue maybe it's

1253
00:54:24,188 --> 00:54:26,256
mechanistically enacted by

1254
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:28,708
bioelectricity in a given system or at a

1255
00:54:28,714 --> 00:54:30,964
given scale, but active inference gives

1256
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:34,164
us the analytical glue to approach those

1257
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:37,684
systems with an open mind and

1258
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:40,904
an open scaffold. And so those are

1259
00:54:41,022 --> 00:54:43,336
some of the insights and fundamentals of

1260
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:45,816
active inference as applied to

1261
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:48,744
collective behavioral systems. Now on to

1262
00:54:48,782 --> 00:54:51,960
the last third of this lecture

1263
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,656
applications and Implications of Active

1264
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:57,400
Inference for the Social Sciences

1265
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,004
regarding collective behavior. This is

1266
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:03,800
really where it is wide, wide, wide

1267
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,616
open. What kinds of

1268
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,520
insights can active inference offer

1269
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,108
about the role of learning, adaptation,

1270
00:55:12,204 --> 00:55:14,476
conflict, and cooperation in collective

1271
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:16,384
behavior? And how can we approach that

1272
00:55:16,422 --> 00:55:18,720
from a cognitive security perspective?

1273
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,216
Here we'll draw on the work of Scott

1274
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:23,344
David and colleagues, active Inference

1275
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:26,272
in Modeling Conflict what implications

1276
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:28,004
does active inference have on the study

1277
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:29,360
of human collective behavior,

1278
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,256
particularly in social, economic, and

1279
00:55:31,278 --> 00:55:34,216
digital contexts? Here we'll draw on the

1280
00:55:34,238 --> 00:55:36,650
work by Poirier et al.

1281
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,012
Communication as socially extended

1282
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:41,236

00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:43,336
to communicative behavior livestream.

1284
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:46,652
48 series what

1285
00:55:46,706 --> 00:55:48,316
considerations that are relevant for

1286
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:51,772
thinking about assemblages and

1287
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:55,004
interactions? What considerations are

1288
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,604
relevant for thinking about assemblages

1289
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:57,984
and interactions among different

1290
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,832
entities in cognitive ecosystems? Here

1291
00:56:00,886 --> 00:56:03,712
we'll turn to the work of Friston et al.

1292
00:56:03,766 --> 00:56:07,196
Et al. 2022, designing Ecosystems

1293
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:09,456
of Intelligence from First Principles

1294
00:56:09,648 --> 00:56:11,584
and how does active inference

1295
00:56:11,632 --> 00:56:13,748
accommodate collective behavior within

1296
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:16,016
and across generations? And here we'll

1297
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:17,892
look at a variational synthesis of

1298
00:56:17,946 --> 00:56:20,000
evolutionary and developmental dynamics

1299
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,730
by Friston et al. In 2023.

1300
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,496
So when it comes to applications and

1301
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:28,184
implications of active inference in

1302
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:31,752
social sittings and settings, again,

1303
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,060
there's so much to do, there's so much

1304
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,624
to learn. So we welcome everybody who's

1305
00:56:35,672 --> 00:56:37,836
curious. This is the time to write your

1306
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:39,550
live chats, submit your questions,

1307
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,580
prepare yourself to explore, and to be

1308
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,288
an active forager in this space. And if

1309
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:47,584
you're listening, you know that you

1310
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:50,556
already are. So in the work. Active

1311
00:56:50,588 --> 00:56:53,276
inference in modeling conflict. Scott.

1312
00:56:53,308 --> 00:56:56,720
David RJ. Corday and myself asked

1313
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,636
what kinds of insights can active

1314
00:56:58,668 --> 00:57:00,564
inference offer about the role of

1315
00:57:00,602 --> 00:57:02,356
learning, adaptation, conflict and

1316
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:04,656
cooperation in collective behavior?

1317
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:06,496
Now, as with all these other papers,

1318
00:57:06,528 --> 00:57:07,716
there's always so many things that can

1319
00:57:07,738 --> 00:57:10,952
be said. What we did is we tried to

1320
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:14,356
connect beyond the very classical Markov

1321
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:16,004
blanket and agent environment

1322
00:57:16,052 --> 00:57:17,304
partitioning, which we've seen many,

1323
00:57:17,342 --> 00:57:19,816
many times. We tried to connect this to

1324
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,012
the specific kind of generative models

1325
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:26,380
that we use in modeling. So here

1326
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,356
we led early by clarifying, this is what

1327
00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:30,696
we're talking about with active

1328
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:33,084
inference, generative models. It's not

1329
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:34,936
like something I'm hiding in my pocket

1330
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:36,688
and maybe I'll show you if you say the

1331
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,752
shibolith. This is what we're talking

1332
00:57:38,806 --> 00:57:41,116
about when we're talking about applying

1333
00:57:41,148 --> 00:57:43,152
active inference models to social

1334
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:44,864
settings. It's a discrete time

1335
00:57:44,902 --> 00:57:47,600
generative model here just a motif.

1336
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,580
We applied that kind of generative model

1337
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,748
architecture to one of the

1338
00:57:55,914 --> 00:57:58,964
most well known models of sense making

1339
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:01,392
and decision making, which is the UDA

1340
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:04,324
loop. Observe, orient, decide, act by

1341
00:58:04,362 --> 00:58:06,856
John Boyd Now this may seem to some like

1342
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:08,824
a quite sparse framework. Like, yeah,

1343
00:58:08,862 --> 00:58:10,328
you get the observation, you figure it

1344
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:11,816
out, you make a decision, you take the

1345
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,144
action. It doesn't do that much work

1346
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:17,452
by itself either. However, UDA is used

1347
00:58:17,506 --> 00:58:19,804
in tactical and strategic settings every

1348
00:58:19,842 --> 00:58:22,190
single day. And so we wanted to connect

1349
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,728
OODA loop to the generative models

1350
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:28,176
that we use in active inference. And so

1351
00:58:28,198 --> 00:58:30,530
we highlighted on the generative model

1352
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,164
where different stages of the OODA loop

1353
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:35,484
occur. Perception happens in the sensory

1354
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:38,632
states. Cognition or the orientation

1355
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:41,456
happens in the perceptual inference,

1356
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:43,396
the downstairs of that part of the

1357
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,892
figure. And then decision making happens

1358
00:58:45,946 --> 00:58:48,164
in the upstairs with the expected free

1359
00:58:48,202 --> 00:58:50,356
energy calculation in this case. And

1360
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:53,476
finally action is selected and enacted

1361
00:58:53,588 --> 00:58:55,972
and that results in impact and the cycle

1362
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,196
begins again. Now, in active inference

1363
00:58:58,228 --> 00:59:00,696
it's more like an unfolding flow, but to

1364
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:02,956
a first pass approximation it does the

1365
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:06,316
trick. Why does that really matter that

1366
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,264
we understand the mechanics of decision

1367
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:11,176
making? Well, we're talking about active

1368
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,804
inference in the social setting. That

1369
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,096
means we're talking about two

1370
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:18,560
sophisticated cognitive entities, maybe

1371
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,496
two businesses, maybe two individual

1372
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:24,130
humans, maybe a person and a business,

1373
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,336
maybe different kinds of systems that we

1374
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:27,876
don't even know about or we haven't even

1375
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,590
seen yet. And that generative model

1376
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,252
is the internal states that is then

1377
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:38,192
participating in this minimal dyadic

1378
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:41,384
collective behavioral encounter. We can

1379
00:59:41,422 --> 00:59:44,740
expand that to thinking about commons

1380
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,348
resource, commons attention, commons

1381
00:59:47,524 --> 00:59:50,696
open source ecosystems. And for this

1382
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:52,736
we utilized one of Scott David's

1383
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:55,004
favorite acronyms of which he has so so

1384
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,820
many, which is Bolts business,

1385
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,070
Operation, Legal, Technical and Social.

1386
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,792
Bolts is not an exhaustive acronym,

1387
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:07,116
otherwise we would need everything. But

1388
01:00:07,138 --> 01:00:09,264
it's a heuristic that encourages us to

1389
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:11,824
think holistically about different

1390
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:13,728
systems. Let's just say that we were a

1391
01:00:13,734 --> 01:00:15,824
business or a person and we wanted to

1392
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:18,228
see if a given policy was a good way to

1393
01:00:18,234 --> 01:00:21,924
go to complete our mission. And it

1394
01:00:21,962 --> 01:00:24,180
looks good, except it can't be done

1395
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,396
operationally. Well then that has to be

1396
01:00:27,418 --> 01:00:29,572
taken into account or everything works

1397
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,480
out but it's illegal. That's not the way

1398
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,536
to go. Everything works out, but the

1399
01:00:34,558 --> 01:00:35,816
business doesn't check out. It's not

1400
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,392
going to be sustainable financially or

1401
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:40,024
technically it can't be done. Or

1402
01:00:40,062 --> 01:00:42,648
socially it's not palatable. All of

1403
01:00:42,654 --> 01:00:44,584
these features of sociotechnical

1404
01:00:44,632 --> 01:00:46,108
systems, which again we just make a

1405
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:48,556
little mnemonic of with Bolts need to be

1406
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,244
taken into account for comprehensive and

1407
01:00:51,282 --> 01:00:53,576
high integrity, high reliability systems

1408
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,096
design. In this setting we have entity A

1409
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,864
and entity B interacting through the

1410
01:00:58,902 --> 01:01:01,824
Bolts niche. They each have their own

1411
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:04,416
blanket states sense in action. And the

1412
01:01:04,438 --> 01:01:06,828
niche where those nest mates were laying

1413
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:10,124
their pheromones, the niche is bolts.

1414
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:12,180
And so you could make a restricted model

1415
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,116
where it's just two entities engaged in

1416
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:16,164
a financial dealing, just a business

1417
01:01:16,282 --> 01:01:19,156
only engaging on B. Or you could think

1418
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:21,812
of this multidomain full spectrum

1419
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:25,416
situation in terms of bolts. Then you

1420
01:01:25,438 --> 01:01:27,492
would have a larger and a more complex

1421
01:01:27,556 --> 01:01:29,400
interface between these two entities.

1422
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,408
But we also wanted to think about the

1423
01:01:32,414 --> 01:01:33,872
case where there might be cooperation

1424
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,916
between these entities or there might be

1425
01:01:35,938 --> 01:01:38,284
conflict. And so here we have entity A

1426
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:41,180
and B. The Dyad is in the spotlight.

1427
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,100
Entity C is a non belligerent state

1428
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,276
or it's a bystander, or it's a witness,

1429
01:01:47,388 --> 01:01:49,648
or it's a referee, or it's a friend, or

1430
01:01:49,654 --> 01:01:52,368
it's a colleague. But entity C is also

1431
01:01:52,454 --> 01:01:54,604
engaging only through their blanket

1432
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:57,596
states on bolts.

1433
01:01:57,788 --> 01:01:59,996
And lastly, we connect it to the Abiotic

1434
01:02:00,028 --> 01:02:03,156
niche which may not care how much

1435
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,504
you're buying or selling a gallon of oil

1436
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:07,876
for. The abiotic niche may have its own

1437
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:09,588
dynamics. We may use active inference to

1438
01:02:09,594 --> 01:02:10,936
model that or we might use some other

1439
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:14,404
approach to model it. And so this sets

1440
01:02:14,452 --> 01:02:17,016
a really, really general state space for

1441
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:18,856
us to understand conflict and

1442
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:21,976
cooperation and where we situated that

1443
01:02:21,998 --> 01:02:25,164
work. Lastly, here was in relationship

1444
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:29,416
to other work exploring strategic

1445
01:02:29,448 --> 01:02:32,476
and tactical decision making and so on.

1446
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,032
The lower end of this image are tactical

1447
01:02:35,096 --> 01:02:37,208
and operational frameworks that are used

1448
01:02:37,234 --> 01:02:39,632
in decision making. On the top are

1449
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:41,616
strategic or scholarly frameworks that

1450
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:43,164
are used for more of like geopolitical

1451
01:02:43,212 --> 01:02:45,424
considerations. And then from left to

1452
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,480
right we have more qualitative

1453
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,452
approaches going to more formal and

1454
01:02:50,506 --> 01:02:52,580
quantitative approaches. And we believe

1455
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,392
that the application of active inference

1456
01:02:55,456 --> 01:02:57,056
through this type of model, the active

1457
01:02:57,088 --> 01:03:00,112
inference conflict model, helps us touch

1458
01:03:00,186 --> 01:03:02,024
the qualitative natural language and

1459
01:03:02,062 --> 01:03:05,256
graphical composable aspects and the

1460
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:07,416
quantitative and formal aspects as well.

1461
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:09,684
And similarly, through nested decision

1462
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:12,592
making cycles we can talk about tactical

1463
01:03:12,676 --> 01:03:16,632
operational activities and the broader

1464
01:03:16,696 --> 01:03:19,884
nested strategy just like we looked at

1465
01:03:20,002 --> 01:03:22,376
the nested cones from Professor Levin's

1466
01:03:22,408 --> 01:03:26,452
work. Next, what implications

1467
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,480
does active inference have on the study

1468
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,348
of human collective behavior,

1469
01:03:30,524 --> 01:03:32,896
particularly in social, economic and

1470
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:34,928
digital contexts? Well, there's a lot to

1471
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:37,228
say about this, but Tisson and Pore

1472
01:03:37,404 --> 01:03:41,012
wrote in 2021 the paper communication as

1473
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:43,044
socially extended active inference, an

1474
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:44,800
ecological approach to communicative

1475
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,992
behavior. And this was in the Livestream

1476
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,836
48 series. Here's Remy raising

1477
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,544
his hand so that we knew that he wanted

1478
01:03:53,582 --> 01:03:57,444
to speak. They introduced an ecological

1479
01:03:57,492 --> 01:03:59,544
account of communication according to

1480
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:02,196
which acts of communication are active

1481
01:04:02,228 --> 01:04:04,908
inference achieved by affecting the

1482
01:04:04,914 --> 01:04:06,956
behavior of a target organism via the

1483
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:08,476
modification of its field of

1484
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:12,024
affordances. Constraining a target

1485
01:04:12,072 --> 01:04:13,836
organism's behavior constitutes a

1486
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:15,708
mechanism of socially extended active

1487
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:19,216
inference allowing organisms to

1488
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:22,812
proactively regulate their interstates

1489
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:24,940
through the behavior of other organisms.

1490
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,816
In this general conception of

1491
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:29,296
communication, the type of cooperative

1492
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:31,300
communication characteristic of human

1493
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,844
communicative interaction is a way of

1494
01:04:33,882 --> 01:04:36,560
constraining interaction dynamics

1495
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,256
towards the goals of a given joint

1496
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:40,432
action by constructing and altering

1497
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,384
shared fields of affordances. This

1498
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,928
account embraces a pragmatist view,

1499
01:04:46,014 --> 01:04:47,928
according to which communication is a

1500
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:49,976
form of action aiming to influence the

1501
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:52,344
behavior of a target and stands against

1502
01:04:52,382 --> 01:04:53,900
the traditional transmission view,

1503
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,320
according to which communication

1504
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,984
fundamentally serves to convey

1505
01:04:57,032 --> 01:04:59,676
information. Understanding acts of

1506
01:04:59,698 --> 01:05:01,564
communication as active inference under

1507
01:05:01,602 --> 01:05:05,016
an ecological interpretation allows us

1508
01:05:05,058 --> 01:05:07,580
to link communicative and ultimately

1509
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,564
linguistic behavior to the biological

1510
01:05:09,612 --> 01:05:11,536
imperative of minimizing free energy and

1511
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:14,124
to emphasize the action oriented nature

1512
01:05:14,252 --> 01:05:16,896
of communicative interaction. This is

1513
01:05:16,918 --> 01:05:20,484
really a rich and excellent work that

1514
01:05:20,522 --> 01:05:23,796
Remy and Pierre produced, and there are

1515
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:26,276
several pieces that I think add a lot of

1516
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:28,468
meaning and value to the ways that we

1517
01:05:28,474 --> 01:05:30,496
think about communication. But most

1518
01:05:30,538 --> 01:05:33,384
broadly, what is communication for? Who

1519
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:35,656
do we talk to and why? What do we like

1520
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:38,552
to talk about and why? Why would anyone

1521
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:43,080
say that? And why? How does technique,

1522
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,252
considered broadly, technology and

1523
01:05:46,306 --> 01:05:48,732
technique, whether it's digital or

1524
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:51,736
social or cultural technique, mediate

1525
01:05:51,768 --> 01:05:54,412
and influence communication? The media

1526
01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:56,288
is the message. The medium is the

1527
01:05:56,294 --> 01:05:58,416
message. And think about everything in

1528
01:05:58,438 --> 01:06:00,636
that area, too. And how can active

1529
01:06:00,668 --> 01:06:02,464
inference, beyond just giving these

1530
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:06,144
incredible composable formal tools, how

1531
01:06:06,182 --> 01:06:10,340
can we think about joint action and

1532
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:13,236
co modification of fields of

1533
01:06:13,258 --> 01:06:15,668
affordances? Hey, could you pick that up

1534
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:18,276
from that shelf? Okay, I'll open it for

1535
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:20,004
you. Now let's hand it to our friend

1536
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,296
who's going to make the food. All of

1537
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:24,676
these ways in which individuals shape

1538
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:28,104
each other's field of affordances is

1539
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:29,752
something that we can talk about really

1540
01:06:29,806 --> 01:06:31,720
fluidly within active inference.

1541
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,124
Penultimate View what considerations are

1542
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:40,968
relevant for thinking about assemblages

1543
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:42,924
and interactions among different

1544
01:06:42,962 --> 01:06:45,896
entities in cognitive ecosystems? So

1545
01:06:45,938 --> 01:06:49,792
here was a large multi author paper from

1546
01:06:49,846 --> 01:06:51,932
Karl Friston et al. And The Versus

1547
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:54,096
Colleagues designing Ecosystems of

1548
01:06:54,118 --> 01:06:55,904
Intelligence from First Principles from

1549
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:59,316
December 2022. And the big picture as I

1550
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:02,724
see it here is what is the role of the

1551
01:07:02,762 --> 01:07:05,812
social sciences after all the course

1552
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:10,000
that we're in now in ecosystems of

1553
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,644
diverse heterogeneous? Synthetic

1554
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:14,676
intelligences. By synthetic

1555
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,812
intelligences, I refer to assemblages

1556
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:19,796
with intelligence, whether it's natural

1557
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:22,296
or artificial. Leave that debate for

1558
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,724
another day, because in their

1559
01:07:25,762 --> 01:07:27,724
application, we're talking about

1560
01:07:27,762 --> 01:07:29,496
synthetic intelligence. Synthetic

1561
01:07:29,528 --> 01:07:31,260
intelligence needs cognitive security.

1562
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,672
Cognitive security needs cognitive

1563
01:07:33,736 --> 01:07:37,264
science. And they began this paper with

1564
01:07:37,302 --> 01:07:39,356
the following this white paper presents

1565
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,896
active inference as an approach to

1566
01:07:40,918 --> 01:07:42,656
research and development in the field of

1567
01:07:42,678 --> 01:07:45,600
artificial intelligence. AI artificial

1568
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,724
with the aim of developing ecosystems of

1569
01:07:48,762 --> 01:07:50,900
natural and artificial intelligences.

1570
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,892
The path forward in AI is often

1571
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,536
presented as progressing from systems

1572
01:07:55,568 --> 01:07:57,172
that are able to solve problems within

1573
01:07:57,226 --> 01:07:59,904
one narrow domain, artificial narrow

1574
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,776
intelligence ANI to systems that are

1575
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:04,276
able to solve problems in a domain

1576
01:08:04,308 --> 01:08:06,664
general manner at or beyond human

1577
01:08:06,702 --> 01:08:08,372
levels, what are known as artificial

1578
01:08:08,436 --> 01:08:10,424
general intelligence, AGI, and

1579
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:14,316
artificial superintelligence ASI. We

1580
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:17,276
believe that approaching ASI or for

1581
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:20,184
reasons outlined below, even AGI likely

1582
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:22,376
requires an understanding of networked

1583
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:24,952
or collective intelligence. Now,

1584
01:08:25,106 --> 01:08:28,416
intelligence in action is behavior. So

1585
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,400
we're talking about collective behavior

1586
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,616
and they laid out their timeline and the

1587
01:08:33,638 --> 01:08:35,216
stages that they see in terms of

1588
01:08:35,238 --> 01:08:37,484
sentient, sophisticated, sympathetic and

1589
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:40,148
finally shared intelligences. But I

1590
01:08:40,154 --> 01:08:41,796
think it's worth to dwell a moment on

1591
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:44,710
the one figure of this paper.

1592
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,988
Figure one belief updating on a

1593
01:08:47,994 --> 01:08:50,456
statistical manifold. And so here we

1594
01:08:50,478 --> 01:08:52,248
have some curve in an information

1595
01:08:52,334 --> 01:08:55,272
geometric space, it's a parameter space

1596
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:59,064
of a probability distribution. And on

1597
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:02,716
this manifold, on this line on

1598
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,256
a plane, lower dimensional manifold

1599
01:09:05,288 --> 01:09:08,856
projection, there's a temporal

1600
01:09:08,888 --> 01:09:11,196
process belief at time t, T plus one, T

1601
01:09:11,218 --> 01:09:15,820
plus two, where initially this gaussian

1602
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,516
that's very distributed becomes updated

1603
01:09:19,628 --> 01:09:21,756
to a sharper peak distribution that's

1604
01:09:21,788 --> 01:09:24,512
going to be resting basically at some

1605
01:09:24,566 --> 01:09:27,040
special point on this curve.

1606
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,372
Whether you're very familiar with

1607
01:09:30,506 --> 01:09:32,868
accelerated optimization on information

1608
01:09:32,954 --> 01:09:35,030
geometric manifolds or not,

1609
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,212
it's really interesting to consider why

1610
01:09:38,266 --> 01:09:41,064
they went with this image. And for those

1611
01:09:41,102 --> 01:09:43,208
again who are familiar or just coming to

1612
01:09:43,214 --> 01:09:45,188
be familiar with some of the formalisms

1613
01:09:45,204 --> 01:09:49,096
of active inference, this is what this

1614
01:09:49,278 --> 01:09:52,170
very talented and transdisciplinary team

1615
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,816
went with when seeking to provide some

1616
01:09:55,838 --> 01:09:59,404
of the only nontextual descriptions of

1617
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:01,372
their work. So I think it's really

1618
01:10:01,426 --> 01:10:04,508
interesting and the big question is,

1619
01:10:04,594 --> 01:10:08,456
well, what is the social reassembling

1620
01:10:08,488 --> 01:10:10,704
the social Bruno La Tour, what is the

1621
01:10:10,742 --> 01:10:14,976
social? What is social? Does social mean

1622
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:17,296
only adult humans talking with each

1623
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:20,364
other? Does social include non

1624
01:10:20,412 --> 01:10:24,552
human species? Does social include non

1625
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:27,844
biological intelligences? These are all

1626
01:10:27,882 --> 01:10:30,696
things that are not just questions of

1627
01:10:30,718 --> 01:10:34,132
theory. So connecting flexible

1628
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,796
extensible frameworks like active

1629
01:10:35,828 --> 01:10:37,544
inference and all that comes along with

1630
01:10:37,582 --> 01:10:41,000
it to this bigger question about

1631
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,404
applications and implications of applied

1632
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:46,516
active inference in the social setting.

1633
01:10:46,628 --> 01:10:49,516
That's what I hope we can explore in the

1634
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:51,064
questions at the end of this live stream

1635
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:52,748
and in the discussions that we have in a

1636
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:56,972
couple of weeks and ongoing. And lastly,

1637
01:10:57,116 --> 01:10:58,924
how does active inference accommodate

1638
01:10:58,972 --> 01:11:01,568
collective behavioral within and across

1639
01:11:01,654 --> 01:11:03,856
generations? And so here I'll draw on

1640
01:11:03,878 --> 01:11:05,964
the recent work a variational synthesis

1641
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,336
of evolutionary and developmental

1642
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,964
dynamics with Karl Friston, myself and

1643
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:14,736
others. And we had two images

1644
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:16,996
in this work which otherwise had a lot

1645
01:11:17,018 --> 01:11:20,288
of prose and formalism. On the left,

1646
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:22,292
we see that active inference,

1647
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:24,920
particular partition, external states,

1648
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,376
internal states, blanket states, here at

1649
01:11:28,398 --> 01:11:31,748
the organismal level, one worm,

1650
01:11:31,924 --> 01:11:36,172
and in an enested deeper system,

1651
01:11:36,306 --> 01:11:40,140
the population, which gives rise

1652
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,716
to the starting positionality of the

1653
01:11:42,738 --> 01:11:45,048
organisms. Think about drawing an

1654
01:11:45,074 --> 01:11:47,836
organism from a gene pool, from a birth

1655
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:52,444
pool and the impact that those organisms

1656
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:55,724
have on the bigger picture,

1657
01:11:55,852 --> 01:11:59,844
maybe it's a bacteria that is

1658
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,228
fermenting so it changes the PH or the

1659
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,880
ethanol concentration of the Kombucha.

1660
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,312
That is this kind of multiscale

1661
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:10,580
interaction that we believe

1662
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:13,152
provides an approach to understanding

1663
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:16,084
ecoevo devo, ecology,

1664
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:17,924
evolution and developmental

1665
01:12:18,052 --> 01:12:20,024
interactions. And the other

1666
01:12:20,062 --> 01:12:23,464
visualization that we use here is of

1667
01:12:23,502 --> 01:12:26,156
nested systems. So contrast that with

1668
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:29,688
the kind of time diamond

1669
01:12:29,784 --> 01:12:33,404
that we saw from Mike Levin. Now here,

1670
01:12:33,522 --> 01:12:36,770
imagine that we're going to cut across

1671
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:40,828
the. Center of this diamond and now it's

1672
01:12:40,844 --> 01:12:42,972
going to look like a muscle fiber fibers

1673
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:46,112
of fibers, because we have, let's just

1674
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:49,924
say this outer blue line may

1675
01:12:49,962 --> 01:12:53,940
be the colony.

1676
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,168
And then each of these smaller entities

1677
01:12:59,264 --> 01:13:01,064
is an estimate and they're composed of

1678
01:13:01,102 --> 01:13:03,384
cells, and cells have constituents too.

1679
01:13:03,582 --> 01:13:08,004
And here we utilized the apparatus

1680
01:13:08,052 --> 01:13:10,196
of the renormalization group which draws

1681
01:13:10,228 --> 01:13:13,036
upon physics to articulate the

1682
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:15,996
separation of scales. So that we can be

1683
01:13:16,018 --> 01:13:17,500
clear when are we talking about

1684
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,964
multiscale systems which we can

1685
01:13:20,002 --> 01:13:22,476
articulate and renormalize across

1686
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:25,404
vertically to use an encultured

1687
01:13:25,452 --> 01:13:28,556
metaphor? And then within a given scale

1688
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:32,112
of analysis, what is the lateral or

1689
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,256
collective behavior? So how do we get

1690
01:13:34,278 --> 01:13:36,508
those interactions amongst nest mates

1691
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:39,184
that are both constrained by the colony

1692
01:13:39,232 --> 01:13:41,716
top down? Again, using a spatial and

1693
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:45,264
encultured metaphor top down scaffolded

1694
01:13:45,312 --> 01:13:47,536
or enabled or constrained by the colony.

1695
01:13:47,568 --> 01:13:50,244
But then what nest mates do matters and

1696
01:13:50,282 --> 01:13:53,656
that influences the colony. And we used

1697
01:13:53,838 --> 01:13:56,916
a few new pieces of formalism primarily

1698
01:13:56,948 --> 01:14:00,712
developed by Coral to help express that

1699
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:02,168
setting. And again, we think it's going

1700
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:04,780
to be really useful for describing

1701
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,844
otherwise quite challenging scenarios in

1702
01:14:08,882 --> 01:14:11,356
ecology, evolution and development. And

1703
01:14:11,378 --> 01:14:15,264
so we come right back to that what is

1704
01:14:15,302 --> 01:14:17,920
a self? What about nested selves?

1705
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,888
And with that, I turn to some open

1706
01:14:21,974 --> 01:14:25,712
questions. What can be said other

1707
01:14:25,766 --> 01:14:29,028
than there are so many open

1708
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:30,710
questions to discuss?

1709
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:36,516
There's many things we can explore in

1710
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,704
the discussion that I'll be facilitating

1711
01:14:38,752 --> 01:14:40,312
in a couple of weeks. And of course,

1712
01:14:40,366 --> 01:14:44,456
beyond we have a coda interface for

1713
01:14:44,478 --> 01:14:46,744
you to submit questions that all the

1714
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,664
course teachers will take a look at and

1715
01:14:48,702 --> 01:14:51,370
give their best attempt on. And

1716
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,456
conversation is collective behavior.

1717
01:14:54,568 --> 01:14:57,036
Now, sure, keeping it inside of your

1718
01:14:57,058 --> 01:14:59,548
head is also collective behavior, no

1719
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:02,892
matter how you think about it. But when

1720
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:05,150
we enact in the social,

1721
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:09,344
then we're really making it happen. So

1722
01:15:09,382 --> 01:15:13,040
with that, I will just show my citations

1723
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,840
and the slides will be shared too.

1724
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,468
Also, there's some extra readings that

1725
01:15:18,554 --> 01:15:20,212
various individuals along the way

1726
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:23,732
suggested to me. So that includes social

1727
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:26,576
ecologies and abductive logic enacting

1728
01:15:26,608 --> 01:15:28,992
like a state. These are not the titles.

1729

1750
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,068
Well, I hope this has been an

1751
01:16:18,154 --> 01:16:21,464
interesting and relevant lecture for

1752
01:16:21,502 --> 01:16:24,900
you. It was fun to prepare.

1753
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:28,424
There are so many perspectives and so

1754
01:16:28,462 --> 01:16:32,388
much territory that there's

1755
01:16:32,404 --> 01:16:35,240
a lot in collective behavior. But again,

1756
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,288
I'm just really looking forward to the

1757
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:39,416
discussion that we can have in a couple

1758
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:41,080
of weeks. I encourage you, whether

1759
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:45,290
you're listening on your timeline and

1760
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,316
at a moment that enables you to join

1761
01:16:48,348 --> 01:16:49,936
that live conversation, I would

1762
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,128
encourage you to join or to join the

1763
01:16:52,134 --> 01:16:53,436
live stream so you can participate

1764
01:16:53,468 --> 01:16:56,464
through chat or whether you want to find

1765
01:16:56,502 --> 01:16:59,708
some other way to get involved. It's

1766
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:02,624
been a great time, and with that, I will

1767
01:17:02,662 --> 01:17:05,184
close. Thank you very much. Until next

1768
01:17:05,222 --> 01:17:05,810
time.
