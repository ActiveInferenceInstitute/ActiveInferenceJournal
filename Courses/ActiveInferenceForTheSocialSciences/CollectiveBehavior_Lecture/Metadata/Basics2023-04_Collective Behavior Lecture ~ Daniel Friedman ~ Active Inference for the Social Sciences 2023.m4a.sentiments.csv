5340	5890	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7860	8930	A	0.5579421520233154	Hello everyone.
9700	12928	A	0.9035234451293945	It is August 2, 2023.
13094	16768	A	0.9101399779319763	We're in the active inference for the Social Sciences course.
16934	22796	A	0.8766787648200989	I'm Daniel Friedman, and this is going to be a lecture on collective behavior.
22988	35572	A	0.517421543598175	Now of course, disclaimers could abound and there's so many ways to go about this topic of collective behavior that in duality, in enactment, I really hope it is multi scale and collective.
35716	42104	A	0.9767462015151978	I'm really looking forward to your comments and your engagement with this area, with this lecture, with this course.
42222	48670	A	0.8865455389022827	So if you're watching Live, you can add comments into the live chat or questions and I'll check them out at the end.
49040	59330	A	0.8412551879882812	Also in the YouTube live chat and in the video description, there is a link to where you can submit questions for all of the teachers of this course.
60180	62016	A	0.8524268269538879	That's going to be a coda form.
62198	68628	A	0.9292669296264648	And just more generally, let's have fun enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence together.
68794	77220	A	0.6381095051765442	And I hope that this lecture can be something like one attempt to make that happen.
77370	83800	A	0.92807936668396	epistemically, we're going to have many fun things to talk about collective behavior.
84460	87012	A	0.8170859217643738	What differentiates it from simply behavior?
87076	90948	A	0.776820182800293	I mean, aren't all behaving systems assemblages?
91124	95704	A	0.6958374381065369	Is not the brain composed of multiple parts, brain and body, multiple people?
95822	98312	A	0.7339404821395874	What are we really talking about with individual behavior?
98376	101020	A	0.6098300814628601	Why do we need adjectives at all for behavior?
101520	105404	A	0.6088109612464905	What is a collective and how would we even know it except through its behavior?
105452	107920	A	0.9479727745056152	So there's going to be all kinds of fun topics.
110340	117628	A	0.9546368718147278	Avel provided me with this image and suggested that it would be a great place to head towards.
117814	120308	A	0.8586575984954834	And so we can think of this as where we're going.
120394	144388	A	0.870273232460022	And where we're going is understanding the agent or the human in a social relationship through social action and the recipient of social constraints and observations through that interface or blanket or holographic screen, the agent or the human is engaging on this sociocultural landscape.
144564	150408	A	0.8797280192375183	And so we can think about that agent of engagement with a social world and the dynamic of sociocultural constraints.
150504	155484	A	0.6340002417564392	Now that's where we're going, and that's how someone else has framed where we're going.
155682	159548	A	0.7363696694374084	What I'll tell you here is how we're getting there, how we're getting there.
159634	161168	A	0.9787678122520447	It's going to be a lot of fun.
161254	165456	A	0.5351042151451111	There's going to be a lot of ants, and the door is going to be wide open.
165558	178820	A	0.5706988573074341	So everyone is an estimate on this slide and we're going to be with our regimes of attention and our stigmaergic trails just absolutely up, down, left, right, all over this sociocultural landscape.
179480	184680	A	0.8903372287750244	All right, so here's the plan for the collective behavior lecture.
185180	188500	A	0.8741282224655151	It's going to be presented as a sequence of views.
188660	199500	A	0.8964780569076538	Each view or perspective is going to consist of at very least a central citation and then one or more reflections on that citation.
200640	208940	A	0.9280115365982056	Four views on collective behavior taken as a bundle will constitute a main section of this lecture.
209100	221040	A	0.9170851111412048	And there are going to be three main sections of this lecture split on one hand into three groups of four and on the other hand into two groups of six splitting into fours.
221120	238090	A	0.5588790774345398	The main three sections are going to be background and Context, which is going to provide some views and insights that are from outside of active inference because surprise, surprise, what was true before active inference or outside of active inference is also true within and after.
238780	240580	A	0.8873721957206726	Then we're going to turn to active inference.
240660	255650	A	0.8132511377334595	Specifically, we're going to talk about active inference insights and fundamentals for collective behavior and applications and implications of utilizing or of conceptualizing of a social system as an active inference system.
256180	266816	A	0.9427849054336548	So those second two sections are each going to center around also specific recent work in the field to split it into two groups of six.
266998	286184	A	0.8811503648757935	The first six views that are presented so all of background and context and then half of the insights and fundamentals are going to be in support linguistically or rhetorically of a declarative statement, whereas the latter six views are going to support or open up to a question.
286382	292170	A	0.876971960067749	And that'll lead us to the final section, the fourth section, which is some open questions.
292620	298620	A	0.9092656970024109	At that time, I will look at the live chat and review any questions or thoughts that people have.
298770	307970	A	0.7070310115814209	And I'll also just open the door and leave it open with asking questions, because that's something that we're going to be engaged in for so long.
308340	312400	A	0.8858524560928345	So let's go right into the first section, background and context.
313060	317600	A	0.8908203840255737	Here are the four views and the four declarative statements.
318840	319952	A	0.570525050163269	Big picture.
320096	333908	A	0.8770168423652649	Many, if not all of the concepts, discussions, questions and views on collective behavior from before or outside of active inference also apply after or inside active inference or in the active inference ecosystem.
334084	341412	A	0.7799496650695801	And so to support and to build out that point, I'm going to talk about four different works and some takeaways.
341556	345020	A	0.7166299223899841	First, watching behavior is complex.
345600	348636	A	0.9396737217903137	Here we'll look at Deborah Gordon's 1992 paper.
348738	350510	A	0.8618133068084717	Wittgenstein and Ant watching.
351280	357276	A	0.7660720944404602	Second, all intelligence is Collective Intelligence, which was a presentation of the same name by J.
357298	357484	A	0.5040801167488098	F.
357522	361570	A	0.918252170085907	Klaudier earlier this year, referencing a paper of the same name.
361940	362784	A	0.5970813035964966	Third.
362982	364940	A	0.5065891742706299	We have never been individuals.
365100	366752	A	0.8725379109382629	A work by Gilbert et al.
366806	386900	A	0.7762871384620667	From 2012, A Symbiotic View of Life we Have Never Been Individuals, little bit of the play on we have never been modern and the metaphors and frameworks and language that we use to talk about behavior, to talk about collective behavior, what adjectives we put in front of, what nouns, that matters.
387060	397308	A	0.9563106894493103	And a great work that Ali shared with me that I think makes this point super well is by Navarro and Gabriellitis from 23.
397474	400600	A	0.8300269246101379	And that work is the morphology of collective intelligence.
400680	404708	A	0.7986817359924316	Network swarm, multitude or assemblage.
404904	411570	A	0.8533370494842529	So let's head straight to Professor Gordon's 1992 work on Wittgenstein and Ant Watching.
411940	434628	A	0.7359499931335449	And so just also for context, professor Gordon was my PhD advisor and so I was able to engage with this material and perspective through asynchronous means such as this paper, but also seeing it actually play out on a sociocultural landscape in the desert in southeast Arizona.
434804	437960	A	0.7838969826698303	That's where the complexity really flowered.
438380	446136	A	0.8815550208091736	And so research in animal behavior begins by identifying what animals are doing in the course of observation.
446248	450216	A	0.8711819052696228	The observer comes to see animals as performing a particular activity.
450408	452188	A	0.7820064425468445	How does this process work?
452354	455528	A	0.7247971296310425	How can we be certain that behavior is identified correctly?
455704	463808	A	0.7999945878982544	Wittgenstein offers an approach to these questions, looking at the uses of certainty rather than attempting to find rules that guarantee it.
463974	466588	A	0.8573579788208008	Here, two stages in research are distinguished.
466684	471780	A	0.8594284653663635	First, watching animals, and second, reporting the results to other scientists.
472120	477744	A	0.8717989325523376	Certainty about what animals are doing has different uses at each stage.
477872	518310	A	0.7595122456550598	And this is really a beautiful and subtle point by distinguishing stages of the ethological encounter, the behavioral scientific encounter, whether we're talking about ants on the ground or people in the cities, separating out the observational moment and the uncertainties that are always at play there from this secondary communication about behavior at which point having really clear defined articulations of behavior becomes so important for scientific reproducibility, integrity, accessibility and so on.
519240	535400	A	0.6829348802566528	Personally, I find that this paper anticipates a lot of the specifications that today we would consider part of the metabasian perspective, which is to say we're making inferences as cognitive systems about other cognitive systems.
536700	541720	A	0.6886809468269348	She wrote, My questions about ant watching do not arise when I'm watching ants.
542060	546524	A	0.598461389541626	Most of the time, I do not think much about certainty when ant watching.
546722	550540	A	0.809759259223938	Replace that for the social human setting with people watching.
550690	553564	A	0.5158031582832336	Sometimes we're just watching people, and that's okay.
553602	554830	A	0.7347772717475891	That's part of the moment.
556260	559072	A	0.6202232837677002	I do not think much about certainty when ant watching.
559206	560530	A	0.6596074104309082	I enact it.
562500	571540	A	0.7034985423088074	The questions do not come from doubts about the certainty of my seeing, but from the ways that doubts about the certainty of seeing have shaped scientific practice.
571960	579860	A	0.7229952812194824	The resolution of the problem would come from changes that would allow observers to talk about what they are actually doing when watching animals.
580540	585000	A	0.5568982362747192	Truthful accounts of scientific animal watching don't yet exist.
585580	590330	A	0.507127583026886	This truth is not yet formed because we have not yet learned to talk about it.
592220	595928	A	0.981914758682251	What a wonderful expression and delightfully.
596024	600476	A	0.5192779302597046	I came to see the confused foragers as patrollers searching for new food.
600578	607632	A	0.6961566805839539	I saw the other foragers as already decided about their destination, not available to be distracted by a new source of food.
607766	615810	A	0.7988458871841431	And so we have this really fascinating dialectic where in the moment we're observing in this predefinitional space.
616260	622084	A	0.8785656690597534	Not questioning, though maybe we went to the field site to ask and answer a question, get data about a question.
622202	635268	A	0.7073754668235779	But in the moment, we're in the flow of observation and not asking questions, though the uncertainty may be the highest afterwards when we're communicating to our scientific colleagues.
635364	653384	A	0.8788818120956421	I defined an outgoing forager as a forager as a nest mate with no object in the mandibles and heading off in a straight line passing a demarcated .3 meters from the colony entrance, then people, well, why 3 meters?
653432	654360	A	0.7711040377616882	Why not 2 meters?
654440	657280	A	0.7220800518989563	Or why can't it be carrying something on the way out?
657430	662320	A	0.8186555504798889	Those questions arise in that precise space of communication.
662740	670036	A	0.6192857623100281	And I wanted to open the lecture with this view because it puts a space between.
670218	672870	A	0.48531508445739746	I see that person putting out a fire.
674040	675860	A	0.7112789750099182	They're a firefighter.
676680	681780	A	0.8427907228469849	In that space between is the interpretive moment and possibility.
681940	689610	A	0.7542366981506348	And reimagining the social has so much to do with this process of, let's just say, ant watching.
691500	695336	A	0.8881471157073975	Second view in this background and context section.
695528	700936	A	0.9309333562850952	And here I wanted to draw from a wonderful presentation that JF.
700968	725620	A	0.9387726783752441	Cloutier, a facilitator and participant at the Active Inference institute, presented as part of his robotics and embodied project, where, yes, he's building Lego robots that do symbolic active inference, but also opening up some great philosophical directions and ones that have a lot of implications for how we think about natural, artificial and synthetic intelligence.
726200	739050	A	0.8711413145065308	This presentation was called All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence, and it was based upon the title and drawing upon a recent 2022 citation by Fallon Days et al.
739420	754408	A	0.7846794724464417	And some of these maxims or expressions that JF provided, I thought were so provocative and also brought us back to that initial question, why collective behavior?
754584	757276	A	0.638464629650116	I mean, what system isn't a collective?
757308	761760	A	0.6285735964775085	So why do we need the adjective if we're talking about behaving systems?
762180	764316	A	0.8305937051773071	What is individual behavior?
764428	765184	A	0.6891871094703674	Individual what?
765222	766204	A	0.6572965383529663	Oh, just one bird.
766252	767296	A	0.5526175498962402	Oh, just one person.
767398	767952	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
768086	769330	A	0.5772334337234497	Made up of what?
770580	778896	A	0.8602835536003113	And so JF wrote some expressions, and you can see from the link and look a little more with some images and more of what he wrote.
779008	781492	A	0.945266842842102	But a few of these, I thought, were just excellent.
781636	787156	A	0.8108559250831604	Intelligence is a process enacted by interacting parts, not a property of individuals.
787268	789450	A	0.5686680674552917	Again, whatever that would even mean.
790220	791800	A	0.7806919813156128	Inaction is death.
792400	796860	A	0.49016791582107544	Being by doing action without prediction is reckless.
797840	799950	A	0.6659545302391052	No prediction without sense making.
800560	806130	A	0.6164978742599487	No sense made without a self versus the world or a self in the world.
806580	809970	A	0.6951584815979004	A collective is differently intelligent than its members.
810580	816770	A	0.7878796458244324	Maybe trivially different, maybe better in every way, maybe another direction in every way.
818840	823328	A	0.7065457701683044	Why do individuals participate in collectives?
823424	826740	A	0.5058491230010986	Why are people in groups?
830220	847308	A	0.7100914120674133	Because sacrificing the autonomy to the collective provides benefit, survival, or even thrival benefits that's that I to we no making of sense without the self acting in or on the world.
847394	850584	A	0.7852017879486084	It's not just some essence that's disembodied.
850632	852670	A	0.6519284844398499	This is what embodiment is all about.
853680	857440	A	0.8436594605445862	An autonomous agent is a self organizing collective of parts.
857860	861250	A	0.8668710589408875	Parts of a collective can themselves be autonomous agents.
862020	865810	A	0.7345722913742065	Collectives form to improve the chance of survival of their members.
866260	870580	A	0.6271843910217285	And an agent in a collective benefits from the intelligence of the collective.
871080	882612	A	0.7912512421607971	So to me, this presentation and line of research pursued by JF and others absolutely puts a bow on the what is an individual, what is a collective?
882756	893900	A	0.6371790766716003	Why do we even talk about, quote, individuals or quote collectives when we recognize the multiscale nature of complex adaptive systems.
895920	902536	A	0.6876626014709473	Third Perspective a Symbiotic view of Life we have never been individuals.
902568	911276	A	0.9024959802627563	This is a 2012 paper by Gilbert, SAP and Tower and just to read a few aspects of what they wrote in the abstract.
911388	918740	A	0.8508550524711609	The notion of the biological individual is crucial to studies of genetics, immunology, evolution, develop anatomy and physiology.
919080	930650	A	0.9074656367301941	Each of these biological subdisciplines has a specific conception of individuality which has historically provided conceptual context for integrating newly acquired data.
933260	949580	A	0.7412986755371094	Few descriptions animals cannot be considered individuals by anatomical or physiological criteria because a diversity of symbionts are both present and functional in completing metabolic pathways and serving other physiological functions.
950240	955340	A	0.6096670627593994	Similarly, these new studies have shown that animal development is incomplete without symbionts.
956180	967056	A	0.8996275067329407	Symbionts also constitute a second mode of genetic inheritance providing selectable genetic variation for natural selection which connects it to the evolutionary concept of an individual.
967238	972816	A	0.8619788885116577	So if we pursue the metabolic oh, it's all the metabolic networks and how they're all connected.
972848	973636	A	0.6894541382789612	That's the individual.
973738	974036	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
974058	976480	A	0.8254732489585876	Well, that includes the microbiome and symbionts.
976560	980496	A	0.6862080693244934	Well, no, it's the physiology and the decision making and the neurophysiology.
980608	982988	A	0.8995468616485596	Those are also in play with the symbionts.
983104	987512	A	0.8119316101074219	Well, at least evolution only selects upon the germ line, right?
987566	995976	A	0.7775039672851562	Well, no, actually there are these multiple mechanisms of inheritance whether they're relevant in a given situation or not is situational.
996088	1000860	A	0.500874400138855	But in principle they exist and they're increasingly coming to be recognized.
1001280	1010124	A	0.567457377910614	Additionally for the immune system commonly described as quote, self versus non self or self identification or self other discrimination.
1010252	1014140	A	0.8489604592323303	After all, we talk about autografting and allografting.
1014300	1027360	A	0.6897572875022888	But of course there are aspects of quote, self or self under some definitions like an epitope from a protein in cartilage that an autoimmune disorder might target.
1027440	1038504	A	0.7473693490028381	So the immune system is mobilized against self under some definitions sometime and is not mobilized against other under some definitions sometimes.
1038702	1044904	A	0.6317940950393677	Like we're not constantly mounting a massive immune response to our gut microbiome.
1044952	1070420	A	0.7481511235237122	Our skin microbiome, recognizing the holobiont, the multicellular Eukaryote, plus its colonies of persistent symbionts as a critically important unit of anatomy, development, physiology, immunology and evolution and cognition, opens up a new investigative avenue and conceptually challenges the ways in which the biological subdisciplines have heretofore characterized living entities.
1070760	1074336	A	0.5799954533576965	Here we have the COVID of the famous work Leviathan.
1074448	1079812	A	0.7009700536727905	It's a large person constituted of other people really making the point clear.
1079866	1087240	A	0.7949190139770508	But if we zoomed in on, quote, an individual person wouldn't we find something like societies of cells?
1088300	1089530	A	0.782533586025238	What is an individual?
1090220	1091784	A	0.7800008654594421	When is an individual?
1091982	1095470	A	0.8331547975540161	What and what's on the line?
1096880	1099420	A	0.6255955100059509	I thought those are such big questions.
1099570	1112530	A	0.8639737367630005	Maybe could we connect it to a little bit of more of a bibliographic piece of data just to show a snapshot and to open up this discussion to you all about what's on the line with what's an individual.
1113220	1122420	A	0.8329019546508789	And so what I did is I searched for some literature trends on PubMed and here is the results per 100,000 citations for collective behavior.
1122760	1135224	A	0.8841146230697632	And so we see collective behavior first being mentioned in the 1950s, at least in this literature database, and rising up on through around 500 or 400 or 500 per hundred thousand.
1135342	1138056	A	0.8374373316764832	So 1000 out of 100,000 would be 1%.
1138238	1149692	A	0.8392900824546814	So half of a percent of all the citations on a major biolytic literature database had collective behavior in them.
1149746	1153084	A	0.7706544399261475	So that's a huge amount of work, and it looks like it goes down.
1153202	1159010	A	0.7491273283958435	But when you actually look at how many citations there are, it's been about 4000 publications per year.
1159380	1164016	A	0.5086681246757507	It's just that the rest of the literature database may be expanding at a faster rate.
1164118	1170304	A	0.8398277759552002	So thousands of papers per year and an appreciable fraction of work has to do with collective behavior.
1170432	1174132	A	0.9895306825637817	And so I thought, wow, that's exciting, that's great.
1174186	1176100	A	0.840959906578064	Well, how are we doing compared to behavior?
1176600	1180224	A	0.6253541111946106	Now, collective behavior is this lower line in red.
1180362	1189000	A	0.7838972806930542	And yeah, there's a Blip, but behavior is up between 15 and 20% of citations in PubMed.
1189340	1200380	A	0.851577639579773	Now, maybe behavior is also referring to the behavior of a given material that may or may not be a superconductor or might be using different understandings of behavior.
1202000	1209280	A	0.8308124542236328	But what can we say and what can we know about the difference between individual and collective behavior?
1209860	1217456	A	0.6450390815734863	Now, interestingly, here I searched for individual behavior as a specific term, so we see a lot lower.
1217558	1223424	A	0.7824861407279968	But individual behavior, I mean, can the tide have already turned?
1223552	1228480	A	0.5284570455551147	Can it really be the case that after 2020, this is a real meaningful decline?
1228560	1229268	A	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
1229354	1230640	A	0.6344820261001587	It's too early to say.
1230730	1250152	A	0.5272417664527893	We can't do technical analysis just like that, but very provocative and gives us some ways to look at the broader scale or collective scientific cognitive process associated with these incredibly important philosophical and biological questions about individuality.
1250216	1257584	A	0.6071534156799316	Because, of course, to distinguish collective behavior from individual behavior, or why would you even need an adjective at all?
1257702	1262290	A	0.7828980088233948	It's going to come down to what is an individual and what's on the line so much.
1263060	1271596	A	0.9150241017341614	And the last view here, drawing upon the work morphology of collective intelligence network, swarm, multitude, or assemblage?
1271708	1283524	A	0.865609347820282	And Tony Devorrow and Alejandro Lopez Gabrielis wrote, network, swarm and multitude are some of the different metaphors that have been used to understand the concept of collective intelligence.
1283652	1287320	A	0.8140432834625244	All of them have reflected our relationship with the Internet and its development.
1288460	1302620	A	0.49697548151016235	With the advent of artificial intelligence AI, we wonder about other metaphors that might offer a new understanding of collective intelligence to address today's environmental and sociotechnical challenges.
1303840	1310716	A	0.8198471665382385	They bring up network, swarm and multitude to advocate for the fourth option assemblage.
1310908	1331270	A	0.7702412605285645	Understanding collective intelligence as an assemblage allows for the inclusion of different human and technological agents and overcomes the anthropocentrism human centrism human exclusionism of other models based on human will, whether extended as in the multitude or suppressed as in the swarm connotations here.
1331820	1339956	A	0.84417325258255	In this way, ethical decision making and responsibility are distributed among different cognitive actors with the capacity to choose and interpret.
1340148	1345080	A	0.8523236513137817	And to the extent that they make decisions, albeit algorithmic ones, they are also accountable.
1345240	1355788	A	0.9408862590789795	And I love this, and I think it foreshadows where we're going to be going with active inference, which is different cognitive actors have the capacity to choose and interpret.
1355884	1360576	A	0.8688974380493164	We might connect that to sensory and internal states of an active inference agent.
1360678	1380756	A	0.8572005033493042	But perception, sense making, signal processing inbound information and decision making and responsibility and accountability and the accountability that we associate with human sociotechnical systems, that's the action selection, control theory, outgoing dependencies in the Markov blanket.
1380868	1408240	A	0.68731689453125	So right there, coming from outside of active inference, we see the identification of the need to have flexible frameworks, including linguistic and metaphorical, that allow us to talk about heterogeneous diverse cyberphysical systems where different entities are engaged in different practices and ways of incoming sense making and outgoing decision making.
1408390	1419076	A	0.9341186881065369	And it's going to turn out that active inference is an incredible and flexible expressive framework that's going to allow us to talk about those kinds of systems pointed to here.
1419258	1420496	A	0.7353372573852539	And it really matters.
1420528	1429472	A	0.838837742805481	They point to some of the most important aspects of issues today on to active inference, insights and fundamentals.
1429536	1435608	A	0.7642863392829895	Well, here, as in all the other areas, there were so many pieces of literature that could have been drawn on.
1435774	1439480	A	0.7452189326286316	That's why I restricted myself to just four views.
1441580	1444972	A	0.9077650904655457	Also, this section is going to mark the midway point.
1445026	1458360	A	0.6246488690376282	We're not there yet, don't worry, but the midway point of the lecture where we move from the six declarative expressions onto the questions because it's more open than not and there's more space for you to respond than you may imagine.
1458520	1461008	A	0.6258063912391663	But the view is going to be here.
1461174	1463808	A	0.8409852385520935	And what are the literature that support that point?
1463974	1474608	A	0.666680634021759	So, first, active inference in the free energy principle, which is a principle that provides a lot of theoretical grounding and physics based perspective on active inference.
1474624	1476550	A	0.8286594748497009	But we're not going to go too much into it today.
1476920	1488264	A	0.7532709240913391	Active inference and the free energy principle are scale free formalisms for cognitive systems with collectives, as with individuals, the general framing in itself does very little.
1488462	1495336	A	0.5443613529205322	However, with properly constructed generative models, we can get explanation, prediction, design, influence, and implementation tools.
1495448	1508460	A	0.8584339618682861	And here I'm going to draw on two pieces of work epistemic Communities under Active Inference by Mahault and colleagues in 2022 and just from several days ago, the work by Connor Hines and colleagues.
1508540	1510720	A	0.8320296406745911	Collective behavior from surprise minimization.
1512020	1514290	A	0.8936571478843689	We'll unpack the point more when we get there.
1514660	1531796	A	0.7976428270339966	Second, collectives can be understood as consisting of action perception loops which subsume, entail, or supervene upon individual level action perception loops, niche modification, stigma, g can also be modeled this way.
1531978	1539448	A	0.7118320465087891	We'll draw upon the paper Active Inference, an active inference framework for ant colony behavior by myself and colleagues in 2021.
1539454	1544200	A	0.7657349705696106	And then we'll move into the questions and things will start to open up.
1544270	1546244	A	0.7715700268745422	So if it feels like we've been climbing uphill.
1546292	1548392	A	0.64067143201828	We're two thirds of the way with the uphill climb.
1548456	1550120	A	0.8988460302352905	Feels like we've been going downhill.
1550280	1560588	A	0.8586656451225281	We're two thirds of the way with a downhill how do the concepts of generalized synchrony and homeostasis, which are so core to active inference, relate to collective behavior?
1560764	1564176	A	0.8961086273193359	Here we'll discuss the work by Ralph Kaufman et al.
1564198	1568000	A	0.8645855784416199	From 2021, an active inference model of collective intelligence.
1568420	1580572	A	0.8962239623069763	And lastly, in this section, how can active inference be used to explore the balance between individual and collective behaviors and the bi directional influence of collectives on individuals, and, of course, vice versa?
1580736	1591400	A	0.8675262331962585	Here we'll draw upon the computational boundary of a self developmental bioelectricity drives, multicellularity and scale free cognition by Mike Levin in 2019.
1591820	1596060	A	0.5797287821769714	So let's get right into the work by Mahault and Connor and colleagues.
1597520	1600396	A	0.8284159898757935	First, I'm just going to bring this paper up.
1600498	1608528	A	0.8290859460830688	However, first you can watch more about it in Guest stream 17.1 from March 2022.
1608614	1610770	A	0.8251826763153076	Here's two collectives right here.
1611220	1616704	A	0.7987872362136841	And also Mahault will be covering this work in a lot more detail later on in the course.
1616742	1627860	A	0.9674779176712036	I just wanted to bring it up because I think it's one of the exceptional examples that can be deployed to show like, hey, just thinking about the social as an active inference system is awesome.
1627930	1629344	A	0.8171104788780212	It's an intuition pump.
1629472	1631904	A	0.5652007460594177	It brings us into the active inference ecosystem.
1631952	1633704	A	0.6887521147727966	But then what do we do when we're there?
1633822	1642170	A	0.7027847766876221	And what we do when we're there is we develop generative models that actually take us towards where we want to be.
1643600	1649016	A	0.722938060760498	Again, framing a situation as being related to active inference.
1649048	1655310	A	0.6877471804618835	Or you could do an active inference model of that does very, very little work by itself.
1655620	1666032	A	0.5396991968154907	However, making generative models of situations, even if they're speculative generative models or qualitative or hypothetical, that can start getting towards doing work.
1666086	1670320	A	0.7920655012130737	But if someone said, well, that health condition, you could do a linear regression.
1670820	1673028	A	0.8525513410568237	Okay, but which treatment do we do?
1673114	1674992	A	0.8464239239692688	Well, it could be done with a linear regression.
1675056	1678388	A	0.888364851474762	We could use a linear regression to figure out what method to use.
1678474	1682612	A	0.8264987468719482	Okay, but more or less hotter room or colder room.
1682666	1684436	A	0.7890270948410034	Well, just use a linear regression.
1684628	1688100	A	0.8444822430610657	So that's the conversation that we're having a lot with active inference.
1688260	1693652	A	0.6361034512519836	A lot of times people are talking about whether a given situation can or cannot be modeled with active inference.
1693716	1698044	A	0.8728395104408264	Or, just in the abstract, what does active inference say about this situation?
1698242	1704828	A	0.8505520820617676	And again, the framework itself is general to the point of doing little work, and we love it that way.
1704994	1710828	A	0.6709185242652893	It enables us to move into systems of interest and deploy generative models.
1710924	1723200	A	0.8862871527671814	So what they did in this paper was leverage the active inference framework to provide an in silicon model on the computer chip model of confirmation bias and its effect on echo chamber formation.
1723360	1732280	A	0.8203200697898865	They had a system of interest people's social engagement on so called social media, and they had even a phenomena of interest which was echo chamber formation.
1733020	1742040	A	0.8575425148010254	They built a model based on active inference where agents tend to sample information in order to justify their own view of reality, something we call self evidencing.
1742380	1749820	A	0.4937571585178375	We show that once agents have reached a certain level of certainty about their beliefs, it becomes very difficult to get them to change their views.
1750400	1763970	A	0.826036274433136	The system of self confirming beliefs is upheld and reinforced by the evolving relationship between an agent's beliefs and observations, which will, over time, will continue to provide evidence for their ingrained ideas about the world.
1764340	1771520	A	0.7792795300483704	Well, where I'm from, we drive on the right side of the road and so you drive on the right side of the road, I drive on the right side of the road.
1771590	1772852	A	0.6179999709129333	We're not going to have an issue.
1772986	1777600	A	0.7950710654258728	Everywhere I look, I see cars moving around, I see people passing on the right, on the sidewalk.
1777680	1778740	A	0.6715391874313354	It's all making sense.
1778810	1780048	A	0.5405541062355042	We're bounding surprise.
1780144	1781344	A	0.8821243047714233	We're doing active inference.
1781392	1791880	A	0.5927436351776123	Surprising minimization goals, reward never need to come into play to give an account of how those systems could arise and be stabilized.
1792880	1803000	A	0.8143311142921448	These epistemic communities are consolidated by those shared beliefs and in turn tend to produce perceptions of reality that reinforce those shared beliefs.
1803160	1814050	A	0.8586798310279846	And on the top right is just a little teaser of what a Bayesian graphical model looks like of the kind that they deployed in this paper.
1816980	1845560	A	0.806769073009491	And here we see some of the results from their parameter sweeping, exploring different combinations of parameters and looking at topics like polarization index and reattenance rate and so all kinds of statistics that can be drawn upon, connected to the generative model and also all kinds of opportunities and interfaces to relate this to empirical data as well as suggest experiments.
1845640	1848604	A	0.976403534412384	So Mahault is going to talk more about this and it's awesome work.
1848722	1868656	A	0.9846189618110657	And then late breaking news only several days ago, five or so days ago, an amazing new pre [unk]print was put up by Connor Hines and colleagues and it was just too cool not to include here and reflects the very rapid pace of collaborative development in the active inference ecosystem.
1868768	1872260	A	0.8828874826431274	And this is their work collective behavior from surprise minimization.
1872760	1877510	A	0.6010456681251526	And they made every point I wanted to make here and now.
1878360	1881080	A	0.7661164402961731	Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature.
1881660	1889496	A	0.8904763460159302	Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized local interactions among constituent components e.
1889518	1893630	A	0.7198805212974548	G, individual fish in a school there's that word individual again.
1894560	1907040	A	0.8810175657272339	Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self propelled particles, subject to self generated motion and social forces such as short range repulsion and long range attraction or alignment.
1908660	1911628	A	0.7254510521888733	However, organisms are not particles.
1911804	1914320	A	0.7459072470664978	They are probabilistic decision makers.
1914820	1916640	A	0.5578558444976807	They're cognitive particles.
1917400	1921616	A	0.8123878240585327	We introduce an approach to modeling collective behavior based on active inference.
1921808	1928980	A	0.8530811667442322	This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative to minimize surprise.
1929480	1939284	A	0.6539113521575928	Again, if you want to, you can contrast that with reward learning, where the imperative is to maximize reward in active inference and the free energy principle.
1939412	1948220	A	0.7196826338768005	We're taking a path of least action not the laziest path or the most passive one, but a little bit more technically a path of least action.
1949280	1950888	A	0.6149904727935791	And we're minimizing surprise.
1950984	1958060	A	0.8503917455673218	We're bounding surprise with variational free energy and it turns out that that helps us minimize surprise and maximize model evidence.
1958140	1962204	A	0.5776883363723755	And it can include things like novelty and curiosity seeking very naturally.
1962252	1966450	A	0.49267813563346863	So this doesn't mean we're squeezing the juice out of life at all.
1967480	1984330	A	0.6688570976257324	We demonstrate that many empirically observed collective phenomena including cohesion milling and directed motion emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents.
1985180	1990916	A	0.5318105816841125	No reward, no goal, no master of the collective.
1991108	2002140	A	0.6756858229637146	Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations.
2002480	2014304	A	0.8927100300788879	By exploring the parameter space of the beliefbased model we reveal nontrivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states.
2014502	2024820	A	0.8872196674346924	We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty, metacognition beliefs about beliefs determine collective decision making accuracy.
2025480	2032500	A	0.7922453880310059	What if when you voted or shared your perspective on what we were going to have for dinner you also conveyed an uncertainty estimate?
2032580	2035530	A	0.8794084787368774	How confident are you about that being the case?
2037980	2048296	A	0.7496130466461182	Finally, we show how agents can update their generative model over time resulting in groups that are collectively more sensitive to external fluctuations and encode information more robustly.
2048488	2055124	A	0.8555288910865784	From a distributed systems perspective you could imagine two different kinds of distributed systems or networks.
2055272	2058624	A	0.7610933184623718	One of them has a dampening like quality.
2058822	2064880	A	0.7660197615623474	So something that enters on one side dampens as it diffuses.
2065300	2072336	A	0.8908251523971558	We can also contrast that with another kind of distributed system or another kind of input or stimulus or context that amplifies.
2072528	2088216	A	0.6715483069419861	And the goal or one nice property to have of systems would be like we want to dampen what we don't want to pay attention to and up signal or increase the cascading availability of what we do want to attend to.
2088318	2092040	A	0.47863835096359253	Now that's a little circular since in some ways that's the definition of attention.
2092400	2109100	A	0.5156593322753906	However, making unified models like they do here gives us integrated approaches to explore a broad range of collective phenomena here in spatial movement but also involving the cognitive states of the particles.
2109260	2113760	A	0.9689114689826965	And they make a really nice representation here to connect to other approaches.
2114260	2118956	A	0.8991085290908813	A traditional approach to classical self propelled particles is agent environment.
2119068	2125060	A	0.796317994594574	Agents take rules and they make decisions based upon those rules that are either given or learnt.
2126280	2131208	A	0.7444328665733337	When you're this close to the bird next to you, do that and when you're this close, do this.
2131374	2141044	A	0.8104808330535889	And then social forces are these kind of as if or actual constraints that then modify the agent's perspective.
2141172	2149420	A	0.8412325978279114	And what we see in the active inference setting is that the agent and the environment are mediated by an interface.
2149920	2151368	A	0.7632865309715271	The Markov blanket.
2151464	2151884	A	0.6003884077072144	This is.
2151922	2153192	A	0.7031604647636414	The sensorium.
2153336	2158960	A	0.9066224694252014	This is on the inbound side perception and on the outbound side action.
2159940	2161436	A	0.8515480160713196	And they give some more details.
2161468	2173190	A	0.9908375144004822	It's a really exciting paper and it's just cool to see again that even in the preparatory days of a lecture like this, there's always new collective activity in the ecosystem and that's what makes it fun.
2177080	2181000	A	0.8876650929450989	Last of the declarative sections of this lecture.
2181420	2196568	A	0.7850210070610046	Colonies here, but more generally collectives, can be understood as consisting of action perception loops which subsume, entail or supervene upon individual level action perception loops, niche modifications or stigma.
2196584	2199470	A	0.8442339897155762	G can also be modeled this way.
2200400	2207824	A	0.6503724455833435	What we did in this paper was bring something new to active inference in at least two different ways.
2208022	2213904	A	0.8475086092948914	First, it was the first model of an ant system of interest.
2214022	2220580	A	0.596671462059021	Now, for some of us mere mycologists in the audience, all of our broader entomology colleagues, that may be enough.
2220730	2231532	A	0.9649976491928101	But what was also really interesting about this work and the opportunity to collaborate on it, was it was the first active inference model presented with explicit stigmaji.
2231616	2247020	A	0.881661593914032	Not just the philosophical consideration of the traces that agents leaving in the environment might then have them change their behavior in the future, but explicitly engaging with this process of multiagent stigmurgic behavior.
2248880	2253992	A	0.6235979199409485	Active inference may be informative in the study of ant colonies at three distinct temporal scales.
2254136	2265036	A	0.7676755785942078	Nest mate behavior, which is to say emergent among tissues of a nest mate, you could keep on going collectively down and interactions with the biotic or abiotic environment.
2265148	2279328	A	0.8654049038887024	So, first level at the level of a nest mate, one of those things with six legs that looks like an insect, at the level of the colony, colony development is emergent among nest mates and their interactions with the niche.
2279504	2283360	A	0.8690997362136841	That is where many people would traditionally assign collective behavior.
2283440	2289396	A	0.7958769798278809	They say, well, one nest mate walking around is individual behavior, that's the individual ants.
2289508	2293240	A	0.8162971138954163	And then the colony is where collective behavior comes into play, right?
2293310	2296284	A	0.7432350516319275	And we're going to see that reified very soon.
2296482	2303340	A	0.8593242168426514	But lastly, we point to the evolution of populations, which is an emergent outcome amongst colonies within an ecology.
2303760	2316400	A	0.8320862650871277	In this work, we focused on the connection between the first two levels of analysis, focusing on the case of stigmergic colony foraging using a modification of previous active inference computational implementations.
2317060	2322084	A	0.5024296045303345	We didn't use the word individual and there's a reason why.
2322282	2338964	A	0.6824684143066406	Because we're saying what we mean more clearly when talking about ants, when we talk about nest mates, colonies and populations of colonies that sidesteps or transcends the discussion of what is an individual and what is a collective.
2339012	2347464	A	0.815297544002533	Because with respect to the colony as an individual, if you want to use that word, the population is a collective with respect to the nest mate, the colony is a collective.
2347592	2354184	A	0.8740582466125488	With respect to the tissue like the brain or the mid gut, the nest mate is a collective.
2354312	2357264	A	0.627452552318573	So we don't need to play the adjective game.
2357382	2364400	A	0.771984338760376	We can just articulate what we're interested in about these systems of interest and complex adaptive system phenomena.
2364900	2376900	A	0.890749990940094	And so what we did was we explored a kind of classical behavioral setting which is food being placed between the arms of a teammates and in this case, rather than a rat.
2379400	2388010	A	0.6994630098342896	I'm just pausing for a second while I believe that my internet is reconnecting and we should be back.
2389820	2397352	A	0.88841313123703	Each ant was described by an action perception loop, an active inference action perception loop.
2397496	2405496	A	0.8219660520553589	And they were able to move within a three by three grid as well as perceive pheromone density within a three by three grid.
2405608	2413484	A	0.8866284489631653	And then they laid down pheromone, they added stigmaergic trace on the way home if they had found a seed.
2413612	2419716	A	0.9361708164215088	And so this does a few interesting things and livestream 29 is where we unpack this a lot more.
2419738	2422036	A	0.7795283794403076	But I just wanted to make two more points here.
2422138	2434132	A	0.8809432983398438	The first is that in a reward centric perspective on ant behavior, the pheromone is seen as a semiotic queue and the seed or the food is seen as the reward.
2434276	2439432	A	0.7360040545463562	And so then we got to use the cues, we got to use the pheromone density to figure out where the good stuff is.
2439486	2441080	A	0.7181658148765564	That's that paradigm.
2441820	2444264	A	0.8252242803573608	We flipped that with active inference.
2444392	2458000	A	0.8046325445175171	Now, the preference we don't need to say reward, but the preference, that which is sought after proximally but teleologically, that which is sought after preferred over is the pheromone.
2458900	2466208	A	0.863949716091156	The seed becomes the semiotic cue that it's time to turn on your pheromone depositing and come home.
2466374	2484410	A	0.6681879758834839	And so that flips our approach to understanding what foraging is about from we're lost in the sauce, trying to figure out where the good thing is out there to we're surfing the 100 foot wave and we'll know it when we see it, and then we'll turn around.
2485260	2486436	A	0.8319038152694702	Very different perspective.
2486468	2495660	A	0.8994317650794983	And then one other point that I had to make for the context was that we used a modification of a previous active inference computational implementation.
2496000	2500510	A	0.9059002995491028	What was the paper that we drew from?
2501120	2509480	A	0.9094218611717224	In fact, it was the acquisition of culturally patterned attention styles under active inference with Axel and Alex et al.
2509650	2529220	A	0.7615950703620911	And what this paper did was they looked at the situation of visual foraging on a vase, a piece of pottery, where the eye was only able to perceive a three by three matrix of pixels.
2529640	2537268	A	0.8892713785171509	And then the eye scanned around looking to recognize broader patterns that were then culturally acquired.
2537444	2548860	A	0.7230397462844849	So maybe one culture or one subculture likes the checkerboard pattern and another one likes vertical lines, another one likes horizontal lines or these other kinds of repetitive structures.
2550320	2559680	A	0.7013697028160095	What's so interesting is that the eye, when it is foraging, does not leave a trace, though it can feel like it, doesn't it?
2559830	2566450	A	0.7662802934646606	But the eye forges around in order to get the bigger picture based on local information.
2567380	2572340	A	0.6997280120849609	What we did is we said, well, instead of imagining that as the gaze location of an eye.
2572680	2579056	A	0.8756577968597412	Let's imagine that as the skin in the game exoskeleton on the ground of a forager.
2579248	2596508	A	0.8040018677711487	So let's think about that movement as something that an embodied forager does with its real body and then conditional in this setting upon it touching the seed or the food, it can lay down a pheromone trail, which the eyes can't do per se.
2596674	2604056	A	0.44960761070251465	And so just really interesting because it's not like this was an ant paper and now we're going to try to cram it into social sciences.
2604168	2613250	A	0.6110879182815552	It's actually like computational work in the social sciences was able to translate to Mirmacology into ants research.
2613780	2620150	A	0.7976326942443848	And so it's a very fruitful and bi directional relationship between studying ants and studying people.
2622200	2627700	A	0.7551921606063843	Now we're going to move into the openness of questions in this second half of the lecture.
2628120	2635348	A	0.8991061449050903	So how do the concepts of generalized synchrony and homeostasis, which are core to active inference, relate to collective behavior?
2635524	2645144	A	0.8273824453353882	And here we can draw upon the work by Ralph Kaufman, Pranav Gupta and Jacob Taylor from 2021 called inactive inference model of collective intelligence.
2645192	2648236	A	0.8155858516693115	And this was also unpacked in Gestream Nine.
2648418	2650652	A	0.7866237759590149	And so here's a little collective over here.
2650786	2666640	A	0.8328259587287903	And that was about two years ago, way back when what they did in this paper was they considered a setting with two trolley cars moving around a wheel.
2667800	2670276	A	0.8545895218849182	And so here's how they contextualize that work.
2670458	2685172	A	0.5472195744514465	Formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local scale interactions between autonomous subsystem components individuals and global scale behavior of the composite system, the collective.
2685316	2691080	A	0.9092427492141724	So they do a really great job staking out what they mean by individual and collective.
2691740	2709600	A	0.8698891997337341	In this paper, we use the active inference formulation AIF, a framework for explaining the behavior of any non equilibrium steady state system at any scale deposit, a minimal agent based model that simulates the relationship between local individual level interaction and collective intelligence.
2710340	2719776	A	0.6118274927139282	Then they had a really creative approach to disentangling how different capacities translated to different collective outcomes.
2719808	2720950	A	0.6475278735160828	And here's what they did.
2721720	2726516	A	0.8946717381477356	We explore the effects of providing baseline active inference agents.
2726698	2743556	A	0.8894942998886108	Model one with specific cognitive capabilities, model two added in a theory of mind, model three added in goal alignment, and model four added both theory of mind and goal alignment.
2743748	2745204	A	0.8091623783111572	What does that look like?
2745342	2750044	A	0.8070713877677917	Again, we're not going to go into all the technical details here, but broadly, this is what it looked like.
2750162	2754430	A	0.8811659216880798	Here was their simplest baseline active inference formulation case.
2754980	2764080	A	0.8996962904930115	And then in the subsequent experiments, they added in either one or the other or both of the cognitive capacities that they described.
2765140	2778870	A	0.8051044344902039	They studied the single DIAD case and they very cleverly expanded that into a large scale multidiad case.
2780040	2792408	A	0.9100932478904724	They utilized their own representation of the octave inference partition in order to facilitate the construction of this model.
2792574	2797452	A	0.8416712880134583	And so in this case, we see the blanket with the sensory states coming in, the active states going out.
2797586	2799020	A	0.7164024114608765	Markov blanket.
2800800	2806370	A	0.864122211933136	Here we see the environment and then internal belief states or cognitive states.
2807460	2819670	A	0.9744303822517395	So very cool work that helps us get a vocabulary around, not shut the book on, but focus on.
2820440	2824656	A	0.8626638650894165	How do different agents come to synchronize?
2824848	2826624	A	0.8467820286750793	What is generalized synchrony?
2826672	2845656	A	0.7021162509918213	Well, it doesn't mean Lockstep turntaking is generalized synchrony, because these two agents, the time that they're talking, has very high mutual information on the other, even though the correlation with their speaking might be negative, agent A is speaking when B is not, and vice versa.
2845768	2850328	A	0.5381695032119751	So from a linear regression perspective, there's a negative correlation.
2850504	2859840	A	0.6525006890296936	But from a mutual information perspective, where you can't ever have below zero information, at worst it's just noise.
2860740	2867992	A	0.5531052947044373	You always have zero or positive amount of information of systems about other systems.
2868156	2878240	A	0.633810818195343	And so that opens the door to understanding generalized synchrony, which is a broader conception of how individuals and collectives are interacting.
2878400	2879536	A	0.7970208525657654	And homeostasis.
2879568	2886964	A	0.8565424084663391	Maybe we could even imagine that these are multiple cells in the pancreas and they're trying to coordinate on insulin sensitivity.
2887092	2895176	A	0.7812824845314026	Or maybe this is multiple people who are securing the defense of a community and they also need to coordinate synchronously and asynchronously.
2895288	2907804	A	0.7941794395446777	And so there's a lot of ways in which this very, very lightweight apparatus of the active inference partition helps us bring together and compose all these cool.
2907842	2908316	A	0.8088870048522949	What ifs?
2908348	2910480	A	0.8319992423057556	Well, what if it had theory of mind?
2910630	2912332	A	0.9100788235664368	What if it had goal alignment?
2912476	2915600	A	0.8912498950958252	What if agents had theory of mind and goal alignment?
2916020	2925780	A	0.9095383882522583	What if we put them in a five x seven grid and then we did this and and that's what we get to do with active inference.
2926120	2937700	A	0.9040898680686951	And lastly here, how can active inference be used to explore the balance between individual and collective behavioral and the bi directional influence of collectives on individuals?
2937860	2952696	A	0.9337663650512695	And so here I draw upon the amazing and singular work of Professor Mike Levin, who wrote the computational boundary of a self developmental bioelectricity drives multicellularity and scale free cognition in 2019.
2952808	2956620	A	0.8632926940917969	This was also explored in Livestream 25 series.
2957060	2974500	A	0.5567651987075806	So, just to pull out a few of the great pieces of this article, and there's a stigmaic trail of many other papers for those who follow, professor Levin writes, I propose a definition of an individual based on its information processing structure.
2975240	2982890	A	0.8411040902137756	The scale and types of goals that a system can pursue, defines or determines the boundaries and the content of the putative agent.
2984220	2994510	A	0.8275073766708374	On this view, what defines a coherent, unified self out of its constituents, components and the surrounding environment is the set of parts that operate towards reaching specific goal states.
2995040	3012770	A	0.9050294756889343	So this is a teleological or a functional or anticipatory or sentient or adaptive or informational concept on individuals, which we can add to the earlier consideration raised by Gilbert et al.
3013140	3021860	A	0.8825046420097351	Here they discuss some of the more mechanistic biological considerations like genetics, immunology, evolution, development, anatomy, and physiology.
3023320	3032116	A	0.8227887749671936	What Levin has done here, and consistent with this, is the informational theory of individuality by David Krakauer et al.
3032298	3036612	A	0.8784489035606384	Is connect this more generally to system capacity.
3036756	3051500	A	0.8863879442214966	And so there is what is here represented as like a time diamond, where the scope or the scale of the system in the now is like the radius or the circumference on this diamond.
3051920	3060210	A	0.8641386032104492	And then the part of the diamond that recedes off into the past, that's retained from the past, is memory and history.
3060900	3070260	A	0.8545555472373962	And the part that advances or pretends into the future is the anticipatory or the planning capacity.
3070680	3083652	A	0.7410761713981628	This opens the door to describing diverse intelligences, including possible alien artificial intelligence or synthetic intelligences, as well as nested or compound intelligences.
3083796	3087364	A	0.5352826118469238	So here the example is the ant colony.
3087492	3104440	A	0.8664608597755432	So here we have cells, these little pinkish diamonds nested within a nest mate, which is the green diamond nested within the colony, which is the blue diamond.
3104600	3108160	A	0.8401750922203064	Now, notice that the nest mate is called an organism.
3108900	3117052	A	0.6663112044334412	I couldn't help but to connect this to Wheeler 1911, whose work is the Ant Colony as an organism.
3117196	3119108	A	0.7826317548751831	Superorganism came later.
3119274	3132752	A	0.6223360300064087	The superorganismal framing on the ant colony reifies the concept that the nest mate is the individual or the organism, because why else would you need to call the colony a superorganism?
3132816	3134584	A	0.7155162692070007	I mean, I think colonies are super.
3134702	3138504	A	0.9252767562866211	I think it's great to call them whatever you want to call them, and they probably don't mind either.
3138622	3145864	A	0.8242354989051819	But the idea that a superorganism is composed of other organisms means that the nest mate is an organism.
3145912	3161920	A	0.8477493524551392	Whereas this diagram, in my perspective, would be as accurate or more to say nest mate here, because under different concepts of organismality, which is to say individuality, if we want to connect it there, the colony can be considered as the organism.
3164980	3187652	A	0.7352880239486694	And of the so many other pieces of this work that are fun to bring out, the way that Levin clarifies his assumptions gives us, first off, some planks that we can jump off of for good and helps us come to terms with maybe like, what do we assume about behavior, about collective behavior?
3187796	3193860	A	0.8489640951156616	How do we want to show up when we're studying collective behavior in general and when we're studying social behavior?
3193940	3197500	A	0.8280147910118103	After all, we're in active inference for the social sciences.
3198160	3203900	A	0.9091449975967407	And so Levin writes, the ideas are explored here from the perspective of the following three core assumptions.
3205040	3206876	A	0.6459691524505615	First is a commitment to evolution.
3206988	3210640	A	0.8127423524856567	Every capacity has a natural history and emerged from simpler variants.
3211300	3217040	A	0.7676991820335388	Second, it is assumed that all metaphors are to be judged by their utility in driving scientific progress.
3217480	3226820	A	0.8202388286590576	There is not a binary categorization of scientific pictures which should be taken literally or not, which can be decided a priori upfront.
3227640	3232368	A	0.8924186825752258	Third, much of the discussion centers around goals related to teleology.
3232464	3248316	A	0.8762561678886414	A hotly debated topic here, goal directedness is taken in the nonmagical cybernetic engineering and control theory sense of a feedback system that operates to maximize some specific state of affairs, which can be modeled as a dynamical system with attractors in its state space.
3248418	3256620	A	0.5865804553031921	And later work by Levin and Fields and others expanded this concept of intelligence just to phenomenal heights and flavors.
3256780	3279300	A	0.5509357452392578	So active inference helps us understand that cognitive glue maybe it's mechanistically enacted by bioelectricity in a given system or at a given scale, but active inference gives us the analytical glue to approach those systems with an open mind and an open scaffold.
3279720	3287492	A	0.7613652348518372	And so those are some of the insights and fundamentals of active inference as applied to collective behavioral systems.
3287636	3299340	A	0.9005005955696106	Now on to the last third of this lecture applications and Implications of Active Inference for the Social Sciences regarding collective behavior.
3300480	3304510	A	0.5945963263511658	This is really where it is wide, wide, wide open.
3306820	3315068	A	0.8524267673492432	What kinds of insights can active inference offer about the role of learning, adaptation, conflict, and cooperation in collective behavior?
3315164	3318720	A	0.8950359225273132	And how can we approach that from a cognitive security perspective?
3319080	3332680	A	0.9076967239379883	Here we'll draw on the work of Scott David and colleagues, active Inference in Modeling Conflict what implications does active inference have on the study of human collective behavior, particularly in social, economic, and digital contexts?
3333100	3336650	A	0.89686518907547	Here we'll draw on the work by Poirier et al.

3360444	3363712	A	0.8743249177932739	Here we'll turn to the work of Friston et al.
3363766	3364288	A	0.6338751316070557	Et al.

3375312	3381216	A	0.8907354474067688	And here we'll look at a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics by Friston et al.
3381258	3382730	A	0.7813780903816223	In 2023.
3383100	3393548	A	0.48594364523887634	So when it comes to applications and implications of active inference in social sittings and settings, again, there's so much to do, there's so much to learn.
3393634	3396120	A	0.8974670171737671	So we welcome everybody who's curious.
3396200	3405952	A	0.5817715525627136	This is the time to write your live chats, submit your questions, prepare yourself to explore, and to be an active forager in this space.

3409140	3410112	A	0.693057656288147	So in the work.
3410166	3412636	A	0.724594235420227	Active inference in modeling conflict.
3412828	3413276	A	0.6436901092529297	Scott.
3413308	3414476	A	0.83225417137146	David RJ.
3414508	3424656	A	0.8712676167488098	Corday and myself asked what kinds of insights can active inference offer about the role of learning, adaptation, conflict and cooperation in collective behavior?
3424768	3428470	A	0.6471002101898193	Now, as with all these other papers, there's always so many things that can be said.
3429400	3438360	A	0.7719860672950745	What we did is we tried to connect beyond the very classical Markov blanket and agent environment partitioning, which we've seen many, many times.
3438510	3445304	A	0.804771900177002	We tried to connect this to the specific kind of generative models that we use in modeling.
3445432	3452504	A	0.5644649863243103	So here we led early by clarifying, this is what we're talking about with active inference, generative models.
3452632	3457532	A	0.6213610172271729	It's not like something I'm hiding in my pocket and maybe I'll show you if you say the shibolith.
3457676	3463868	A	0.7733914852142334	This is what we're talking about when we're talking about applying active inference models to social settings.
3463964	3467600	A	0.8662391304969788	It's a discrete time generative model here just a motif.
3469400	3481968	A	0.5587976574897766	We applied that kind of generative model architecture to one of the most well known models of sense making and decision making, which is the UDA loop.
3482064	3488340	A	0.8314722776412964	Observe, orient, decide, act by John Boyd Now this may seem to some like a quite sparse framework.
3488420	3492600	A	0.781097412109375	Like, yeah, you get the observation, you figure it out, you make a decision, you take the action.
3493500	3496200	A	0.49400559067726135	It doesn't do that much work by itself either.
3496270	3500524	A	0.8936727046966553	However, UDA is used in tactical and strategic settings every single day.
3500642	3507916	A	0.7618221640586853	And so we wanted to connect OODA loop to the generative models that we use in active inference.
3507948	3513724	A	0.865814208984375	And so we highlighted on the generative model where different stages of the OODA loop occur.
3513852	3516032	A	0.5205948948860168	Perception happens in the sensory states.
3516166	3524036	A	0.7960782647132874	Cognition or the orientation happens in the perceptual inference, the downstairs of that part of the figure.
3524218	3530004	A	0.8729564547538757	And then decision making happens in the upstairs with the expected free energy calculation in this case.
3530122	3536952	A	0.6499462723731995	And finally action is selected and enacted and that results in impact and the cycle begins again.
3537086	3543660	A	0.6472137570381165	Now, in active inference it's more like an unfolding flow, but to a first pass approximation it does the trick.
3544160	3548860	A	0.49527889490127563	Why does that really matter that we understand the mechanics of decision making?
3549010	3553020	A	0.8832902908325195	Well, we're talking about active inference in the social setting.
3553440	3568710	A	0.7361932992935181	That means we're talking about two sophisticated cognitive entities, maybe two businesses, maybe two individual humans, maybe a person and a business, maybe different kinds of systems that we don't even know about or we haven't even seen yet.
3569880	3580180	A	0.8938167691230774	And that generative model is the internal states that is then participating in this minimal dyadic collective behavioral encounter.
3580860	3589400	A	0.5623504519462585	We can expand that to thinking about commons resource, commons attention, commons open source ecosystems.
3589740	3601070	A	0.734472930431366	And for this we utilized one of Scott David's favorite acronyms of which he has so so many, which is Bolts business, Operation, Legal, Technical and Social.
3601920	3606430	A	0.5525102019309998	Bolts is not an exhaustive acronym, otherwise we would need everything.
3606800	3612508	A	0.560331404209137	But it's a heuristic that encourages us to think holistically about different systems.
3612604	3620048	A	0.8319945335388184	Let's just say that we were a business or a person and we wanted to see if a given policy was a good way to go to complete our mission.
3620224	3625264	A	0.3894602656364441	And it looks good, except it can't be done operationally.
3625392	3631120	A	0.6053102016448975	Well then that has to be taken into account or everything works out but it's illegal.
3631280	3633256	A	0.8434874415397644	That's not the way to go.
3633438	3635496	A	0.4869089722633362	Everything works out, but the business doesn't check out.
3635518	3639784	A	0.8928310871124268	It's not going to be sustainable financially or technically it can't be done.
3639822	3641720	A	0.7615513205528259	Or socially it's not palatable.
3642140	3654236	A	0.727738082408905	All of these features of sociotechnical systems, which again we just make a little mnemonic of with Bolts need to be taken into account for comprehensive and high integrity, high reliability systems design.
3654418	3660716	A	0.915376603603363	In this setting we have entity A and entity B interacting through the Bolts niche.
3660828	3663708	A	0.8102617263793945	They each have their own blanket states sense in action.
3663884	3670124	A	0.8105968832969666	And the niche where those nest mates were laying their pheromones, the niche is bolts.
3670252	3677990	A	0.8155157566070557	And so you could make a restricted model where it's just two entities engaged in a financial dealing, just a business only engaging on B.
3678360	3684280	A	0.8920297026634216	Or you could think of this multidomain full spectrum situation in terms of bolts.
3684620	3689400	A	0.7361510396003723	Then you would have a larger and a more complex interface between these two entities.
3689740	3696584	A	0.8407070636749268	But we also wanted to think about the case where there might be cooperation between these entities or there might be conflict.
3696712	3698684	A	0.7940425872802734	And so here we have entity A and B.
3698722	3701180	A	0.6532865762710571	The Dyad is in the spotlight.
3701760	3710412	A	0.8391754627227783	Entity C is a non belligerent state or it's a bystander, or it's a witness, or it's a referee, or it's a friend, or it's a colleague.
3710476	3717596	A	0.8961625099182129	But entity C is also engaging only through their blanket states on bolts.
3717788	3726148	A	0.8070539236068726	And lastly, we connect it to the Abiotic niche which may not care how much you're buying or selling a gallon of oil for.
3726314	3728352	A	0.5018267631530762	The abiotic niche may have its own dynamics.
3728416	3732056	A	0.8870896697044373	We may use active inference to model that or we might use some other approach to model it.
3732158	3742436	A	0.7673194408416748	And so this sets a really, really general state space for us to understand conflict and cooperation and where we situated that work.
3742558	3752476	A	0.898245632648468	Lastly, here was in relationship to other work exploring strategic and tactical decision making and so on.
3752498	3758240	A	0.8149826526641846	The lower end of this image are tactical and operational frameworks that are used in decision making.
3758390	3764140	A	0.9081102013587952	On the top are strategic or scholarly frameworks that are used for more of like geopolitical considerations.
3764300	3771776	A	0.8633557558059692	And then from left to right we have more qualitative approaches going to more formal and quantitative approaches.
3771888	3787416	A	0.5949805378913879	And we believe that the application of active inference through this type of model, the active inference conflict model, helps us touch the qualitative natural language and graphical composable aspects and the quantitative and formal aspects as well.
3787518	3802990	A	0.8073992133140564	And similarly, through nested decision making cycles we can talk about tactical operational activities and the broader nested strategy just like we looked at the nested cones from Professor Levin's work.
3804880	3814076	A	0.9003901481628418	Next, what implications does active inference have on the study of human collective behavior, particularly in social, economic and digital contexts?
3814188	3825408	A	0.8279825448989868	Well, there's a lot to say about this, but Tisson and Pore wrote in 2021 the paper communication as socially extended active inference, an ecological approach to communicative behavior.
3825504	3828224	A	0.8777585625648499	And this was in the Livestream 48 series.
3828352	3834330	A	0.7740769982337952	Here's Remy raising his hand so that we knew that he wanted to speak.
3835740	3849580	A	0.9071774482727051	They introduced an ecological account of communication according to which acts of communication are active inference achieved by affecting the behavior of a target organism via the modification of its field of affordances.
3850880	3864940	A	0.8856726884841919	Constraining a target organism's behavior constitutes a mechanism of socially extended active inference allowing organisms to proactively regulate their interstates through the behavior of other organisms.
3865100	3882520	A	0.8790171146392822	In this general conception of communication, the type of cooperative communication characteristic of human communicative interaction is a way of constraining interaction dynamics towards the goals of a given joint action by constructing and altering shared fields of affordances.
3883020	3897630	A	0.7643595337867737	This account embraces a pragmatist view, according to which communication is a form of action aiming to influence the behavior of a target and stands against the traditional transmission view, according to which communication fundamentally serves to convey information.
3898480	3916220	A	0.5811477899551392	Understanding acts of communication as active inference under an ecological interpretation allows us to link communicative and ultimately linguistic behavior to the biological imperative of minimizing free energy and to emphasize the action oriented nature of communicative interaction.
3916380	3929632	A	0.9852824211120605	This is really a rich and excellent work that Remy and Pierre produced, and there are several pieces that I think add a lot of meaning and value to the ways that we think about communication.
3929776	3932920	A	0.8454354405403137	But most broadly, what is communication for?
3933070	3934792	A	0.8078157901763916	Who do we talk to and why?
3934926	3937130	A	0.9029569029808044	What do we like to talk about and why?
3937580	3939112	A	0.6684204936027527	Why would anyone say that?
3939166	3940090	A	0.6830524802207947	And why?
3941260	3953688	A	0.8963355422019958	How does technique, considered broadly, technology and technique, whether it's digital or social or cultural technique, mediate and influence communication?
3953864	3955260	A	0.5882436633110046	The media is the message.
3955410	3956944	A	0.7117016315460205	The medium is the message.
3957142	3959344	A	0.8126899600028992	And think about everything in that area, too.
3959462	3973872	A	0.5894654393196106	And how can active inference, beyond just giving these incredible composable formal tools, how can we think about joint action and co modification of fields of affordances?
3973936	3976880	A	0.879273533821106	Hey, could you pick that up from that shelf?
3977040	3978676	A	0.6109260320663452	Okay, I'll open it for you.
3978778	3981624	A	0.8478274941444397	Now let's hand it to our friend who's going to make the food.
3981822	3991720	A	0.7344431281089783	All of these ways in which individuals shape each other's field of affordances is something that we can talk about really fluidly within active inference.
3994400	4005400	A	0.9157018065452576	Penultimate View what considerations are relevant for thinking about assemblages and interactions among different entities in cognitive ecosystems?
4005560	4011120	A	0.8245754241943359	So here was a large multi author paper from Karl Friston et al.
4011190	4016608	A	0.9185605049133301	And The Versus Colleagues designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles from December 2022.
4016614	4031956	A	0.8529649972915649	And the big picture as I see it here is what is the role of the social sciences after all the course that we're in now in ecosystems of diverse heterogeneous?
4032068	4033668	A	0.6060660481452942	Synthetic intelligences.
4033844	4040900	A	0.8444572687149048	By synthetic intelligences, I refer to assemblages with intelligence, whether it's natural or artificial.
4041060	4048888	A	0.6402679681777954	Leave that debate for another day, because in their application, we're talking about synthetic intelligence.
4048984	4051260	A	0.6289464235305786	Synthetic intelligence needs cognitive security.
4051410	4054460	A	0.7722969055175781	Cognitive security needs cognitive science.
4055120	4063692	A	0.8693183064460754	And they began this paper with the following this white paper presents active inference as an approach to research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.
4063756	4070900	A	0.5879513621330261	AI artificial with the aim of developing ecosystems of natural and artificial intelligences.
4071800	4093000	A	0.5883399248123169	The path forward in AI is often presented as progressing from systems that are able to solve problems within one narrow domain, artificial narrow intelligence ANI to systems that are able to solve problems in a domain general manner at or beyond human levels, what are known as artificial general intelligence, AGI, and artificial superintelligence ASI.
4094000	4104056	A	0.8121530413627625	We believe that approaching ASI or for reasons outlined below, even AGI likely requires an understanding of networked or collective intelligence.
4104248	4107980	A	0.7846216559410095	Now, intelligence in action is behavior.
4108140	4119536	A	0.8345756530761719	So we're talking about collective behavior and they laid out their timeline and the stages that they see in terms of sentient, sophisticated, sympathetic and finally shared intelligences.
4119728	4124710	A	0.7384788990020752	But I think it's worth to dwell a moment on the one figure of this paper.
4125320	4129520	A	0.9049403667449951	Figure one belief updating on a statistical manifold.
4129680	4137160	A	0.8658133745193481	And so here we have some curve in an information geometric space, it's a parameter space of a probability distribution.
4137740	4167040	A	0.8575713038444519	And on this manifold, on this line on a plane, lower dimensional manifold projection, there's a temporal process belief at time t, T plus one, T plus two, where initially this gaussian that's very distributed becomes updated to a sharper peak distribution that's going to be resting basically at some special point on this curve.
4168440	4179964	A	0.7531757354736328	Whether you're very familiar with accelerated optimization on information geometric manifolds or not, it's really interesting to consider why they went with this image.
4180112	4200220	A	0.6921555399894714	And for those again who are familiar or just coming to be familiar with some of the formalisms of active inference, this is what this very talented and transdisciplinary team went with when seeking to provide some of the only nontextual descriptions of their work.
4200370	4211136	A	0.9241107702255249	So I think it's really interesting and the big question is, well, what is the social reassembling the social Bruno La Tour, what is the social?
4211238	4212290	A	0.830855667591095	What is social?
4213220	4217936	A	0.8249151110649109	Does social mean only adult humans talking with each other?
4218118	4221996	A	0.7922612428665161	Does social include non human species?
4222188	4226820	A	0.8372993469238281	Does social include non biological intelligences?
4227160	4231400	A	0.7668882608413696	These are all things that are not just questions of theory.
4231740	4246516	A	0.6550433039665222	So connecting flexible extensible frameworks like active inference and all that comes along with it to this bigger question about applications and implications of applied active inference in the social setting.
4246628	4255020	A	0.6512549519538879	That's what I hope we can explore in the questions at the end of this live stream and in the discussions that we have in a couple of weeks and ongoing.
4255860	4262412	A	0.8911951780319214	And lastly, how does active inference accommodate collective behavioral within and across generations?
4262556	4271590	A	0.8583090305328369	And so here I'll draw on the recent work a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics with Karl Friston, myself and others.
4272280	4278660	A	0.851632297039032	And we had two images in this work which otherwise had a lot of prose and formalism.
4279160	4303656	A	0.8838476538658142	On the left, we see that active inference, particular partition, external states, internal states, blanket states, here at the organismal level, one worm, and in an enested deeper system, the population, which gives rise to the starting positionality of the organisms.
4303768	4324880	A	0.8520110845565796	Think about drawing an organism from a gene pool, from a birth pool and the impact that those organisms have on the bigger picture, maybe it's a bacteria that is fermenting so it changes the PH or the ethanol concentration of the Kombucha.
4325040	4339080	A	0.6165222525596619	That is this kind of multiscale interaction that we believe provides an approach to understanding ecoevo devo, ecology, evolution and developmental interactions.
4339420	4344288	A	0.8716722726821899	And the other visualization that we use here is of nested systems.
4344324	4352140	A	0.5156051516532898	So contrast that with the kind of time diamond that we saw from Mike Levin.
4352560	4357824	A	0.8242459297180176	Now here, imagine that we're going to cut across the.
4357862	4373940	A	0.81839519739151	Center of this diamond and now it's going to look like a muscle fiber fibers of fibers, because we have, let's just say this outer blue line may be the colony.
4374920	4383384	A	0.8850192427635193	And then each of these smaller entities is an estimate and they're composed of cells, and cells have constituents too.
4383582	4394856	A	0.8945841789245605	And here we utilized the apparatus of the renormalization group which draws upon physics to articulate the separation of scales.
4395048	4406220	A	0.8520166277885437	So that we can be clear when are we talking about multiscale systems which we can articulate and renormalize across vertically to use an encultured metaphor?
4406380	4413404	A	0.8858627080917358	And then within a given scale of analysis, what is the lateral or collective behavior?
4413532	4420052	A	0.7021550536155701	So how do we get those interactions amongst nest mates that are both constrained by the colony top down?
4420186	4427536	A	0.6942307353019714	Again, using a spatial and encultured metaphor top down scaffolded or enabled or constrained by the colony.
4427568	4432228	A	0.8344752192497253	But then what nest mates do matters and that influences the colony.
4432404	4441124	A	0.7977120876312256	And we used a few new pieces of formalism primarily developed by Coral to help express that setting.
4441172	4450920	A	0.902063250541687	And again, we think it's going to be really useful for describing otherwise quite challenging scenarios in ecology, evolution and development.
4451080	4455808	A	0.8406211733818054	And so we come right back to that what is a self?
4455894	4457920	A	0.7898609638214111	What about nested selves?
4459460	4462610	A	0.8268482685089111	And with that, I turn to some open questions.
4463780	4470710	A	0.7563809156417847	What can be said other than there are so many open questions to discuss?
4471480	4479540	A	0.7661755681037903	There's many things we can explore in the discussion that I'll be facilitating in a couple of weeks.
4479610	4490250	A	0.6414196491241455	And of course, beyond we have a coda interface for you to submit questions that all the course teachers will take a look at and give their best attempt on.
4490620	4494456	A	0.8547937870025635	And conversation is collective behavior.
4494568	4501404	A	0.7936643958091736	Now, sure, keeping it inside of your head is also collective behavior, no matter how you think about it.
4501522	4508816	A	0.6094793677330017	But when we enact in the social, then we're really making it happen.
4508998	4515840	A	0.685945987701416	So with that, I will just show my citations and the slides will be shared too.
4515910	4521412	A	0.8936108946800232	Also, there's some extra readings that various individuals along the way suggested to me.
4521546	4527510	A	0.7472097277641296	So that includes social ecologies and abductive logic enacting like a state.
4527960	4528992	A	0.5799266695976257	These are not the titles.
4529056	4530576	A	0.6588021516799927	The titles are inactive.

4583100	4584900	A	0.9052850008010864	It was fun to prepare.
4585060	4594516	A	0.7710179090499878	There are so many perspectives and so much territory that there's a lot in collective behavior.
4594628	4599880	A	0.9524850249290466	But again, I'm just really looking forward to the discussion that we can have in a couple of weeks.
