5340	22796	1	A	0.70328	00:05	32	You. Hello everyone. It is August 2, 2023. We're in the active inference for the Social Sciences course. I'm Daniel Friedman, and this is going to be a lecture on collective behavior.
22988	62016	2	A	1.0	00:22	111	Now of course, disclaimers could abound and there's so many ways to go about this topic of collective behavior that in duality, in enactment, I really hope it is multi scale and collective. I'm really looking forward to your comments and your engagement with this area, with this lecture, with this course. So if you're watching Live, you can add comments into the live chat or questions and I'll check them out at the end. Also in the YouTube live chat and in the video description, there is a link to where you can submit questions for all of the teachers of this course. That's going to be a coda form.
62198	90948	3	A	0.79	01:02	55	And just more generally, let's have fun enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence together. And I hope that this lecture can be something like one attempt to make that happen. epistemically, we're going to have many fun things to talk about collective behavior. What differentiates it from simply behavior? I mean, aren't all behaving systems assemblages?
91124	107920	4	A	0.99932	01:31	56	Is not the brain composed of multiple parts, brain and body, multiple people? What are we really talking about with individual behavior? Why do we need adjectives at all for behavior? What is a collective and how would we even know it except through its behavior? So there's going to be all kinds of fun topics.
110340	155484	5	A	0.92314	01:50	109	Avel provided me with this image and suggested that it would be a great place to head towards. And so we can think of this as where we're going. And where we're going is understanding the agent or the human in a social relationship through social action and the recipient of social constraints and observations through that interface or blanket or holographic screen, the agent or the human is engaging on this sociocultural landscape. And so we can think about that agent of engagement with a social world and the dynamic of sociocultural constraints. Now that's where we're going, and that's how someone else has framed where we're going.
155682	184680	6	A	0.99999	02:35	83	What I'll tell you here is how we're getting there, how we're getting there. It's going to be a lot of fun. There's going to be a lot of ants, and the door is going to be wide open. So everyone is an estimate on this slide and we're going to be with our regimes of attention and our stigmaergic trails just absolutely up, down, left, right, all over this sociocultural landscape. All right, so here's the plan for the collective behavior lecture.
185180	238090	7	A	0.99887	03:05	132	It's going to be presented as a sequence of views. Each view or perspective is going to consist of at very least a central citation and then one or more reflections on that citation. Four views on collective behavior taken as a bundle will constitute a main section of this lecture. And there are going to be three main sections of this lecture split on one hand into three groups of four and on the other hand into two groups of six splitting into fours. The main three sections are going to be background and Context, which is going to provide some views and insights that are from outside of active inference because surprise, surprise, what was true before active inference or outside of active inference is also true within and after.
238780	292170	8	A	0.99997	03:58	131	Then we're going to turn to active inference. Specifically, we're going to talk about active inference insights and fundamentals for collective behavior and applications and implications of utilizing or of conceptualizing of a social system as an active inference system. So those second two sections are each going to center around also specific recent work in the field to split it into two groups of six. The first six views that are presented so all of background and context and then half of the insights and fundamentals are going to be in support linguistically or rhetorically of a declarative statement, whereas the latter six views are going to support or open up to a question. And that'll lead us to the final section, the fourth section, which is some open questions.
292620	319952	9	A	1.0	04:52	69	At that time, I will look at the live chat and review any questions or thoughts that people have. And I'll also just open the door and leave it open with asking questions, because that's something that we're going to be engaged in for so long. So let's go right into the first section, background and context. Here are the four views and the four declarative statements. Big picture.
320096	350510	10	A	0.99997	05:20	72	Many, if not all of the concepts, discussions, questions and views on collective behavior from before or outside of active inference also apply after or inside active inference or in the active inference ecosystem. And so to support and to build out that point, I'm going to talk about four different works and some takeaways. First, watching behavior is complex. Here we'll look at Deborah Gordon's 1992 paper. Wittgenstein and Ant watching.
351280	364940	11	A	1.0	05:51	34	Second, all intelligence is Collective Intelligence, which was a presentation of the same name by J. F. Klaudier earlier this year, referencing a paper of the same name. Third. We have never been individuals.
365100	404708	12	A	1.0	06:05	97	A work by Gilbert et al. From 2012, A Symbiotic View of Life we Have Never Been Individuals, little bit of the play on we have never been modern and the metaphors and frameworks and language that we use to talk about behavior, to talk about collective behavior, what adjectives we put in front of, what nouns, that matters. And a great work that Ali shared with me that I think makes this point super well is by Navarro and Gabriellitis from 23. And that work is the morphology of collective intelligence. Network swarm, multitude or assemblage.
404904	450216	13	A	0.99688	06:44	97	So let's head straight to Professor Gordon's 1992 work on Wittgenstein and Ant Watching. And so just also for context, professor Gordon was my PhD advisor and so I was able to engage with this material and perspective through asynchronous means such as this paper, but also seeing it actually play out on a sociocultural landscape in the desert in southeast Arizona. That's where the complexity really flowered. And so research in animal behavior begins by identifying what animals are doing in the course of observation. The observer comes to see animals as performing a particular activity.
450408	471780	14	A	0.99981	07:30	55	How does this process work? How can we be certain that behavior is identified correctly? Wittgenstein offers an approach to these questions, looking at the uses of certainty rather than attempting to find rules that guarantee it. Here, two stages in research are distinguished. First, watching animals, and second, reporting the results to other scientists.
472120	546524	15	A	0.99991	07:52	150	Certainty about what animals are doing has different uses at each stage. And this is really a beautiful and subtle point by distinguishing stages of the ethological encounter, the behavioral scientific encounter, whether we're talking about ants on the ground or people in the cities, separating out the observational moment and the uncertainties that are always at play there from this secondary communication about behavior at which point having really clear defined articulations of behavior becomes so important for scientific reproducibility, integrity, accessibility and so on. Personally, I find that this paper anticipates a lot of the specifications that today we would consider part of the metabasian perspective, which is to say we're making inferences as cognitive systems about other cognitive systems. She wrote, My questions about ant watching do not arise when I'm watching ants. Most of the time, I do not think much about certainty when ant watching.
546722	560530	16	A	0.99998	09:06	36	Replace that for the social human setting with people watching. Sometimes we're just watching people, and that's okay. That's part of the moment. I do not think much about certainty when ant watching. I enact it.
562500	595928	17	A	1.0	09:22	83	The questions do not come from doubts about the certainty of my seeing, but from the ways that doubts about the certainty of seeing have shaped scientific practice. The resolution of the problem would come from changes that would allow observers to talk about what they are actually doing when watching animals. Truthful accounts of scientific animal watching don't yet exist. This truth is not yet formed because we have not yet learned to talk about it. What a wonderful expression and delightfully.
596024	635268	18	A	1.0	09:56	103	I came to see the confused foragers as patrollers searching for new food. I saw the other foragers as already decided about their destination, not available to be distracted by a new source of food. And so we have this really fascinating dialectic where in the moment we're observing in this predefinitional space. Not questioning, though maybe we went to the field site to ask and answer a question, get data about a question. But in the moment, we're in the flow of observation and not asking questions, though the uncertainty may be the highest afterwards when we're communicating to our scientific colleagues.
635364	670036	19	A	0.56	10:35	80	I defined an outgoing forager as a forager as a nest mate with no object in the mandibles and heading off in a straight line passing a demarcated .3 meters from the colony entrance, then people, well, why 3 meters? Why not 2 meters? Or why can't it be carrying something on the way out? Those questions arise in that precise space of communication. And I wanted to open the lecture with this view because it puts a space between.
670218	695336	20	A	0.56	11:10	47	I see that person putting out a fire. They're a firefighter. In that space between is the interpretive moment and possibility. And reimagining the social has so much to do with this process of, let's just say, ant watching. Second view in this background and context section.
695528	757276	21	A	0.98	11:35	130	And here I wanted to draw from a wonderful presentation that JF. Cloutier, a facilitator and participant at the Active Inference institute, presented as part of his robotics and embodied project, where, yes, he's building Lego robots that do symbolic active inference, but also opening up some great philosophical directions and ones that have a lot of implications for how we think about natural, artificial and synthetic intelligence. This presentation was called All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence, and it was based upon the title and drawing upon a recent 2022 citation by Fallon Days et al. And some of these maxims or expressions that JF provided, I thought were so provocative and also brought us back to that initial question, why collective behavior? I mean, what system isn't a collective?
757308	767296	22	A	0.99863	12:37	27	So why do we need the adjective if we're talking about behaving systems? What is individual behavior? Individual what? Oh, just one bird. Oh, just one person.
767398	787156	23	A	0.76682	12:47	55	Okay. Made up of what? And so JF wrote some expressions, and you can see from the link and look a little more with some images and more of what he wrote. But a few of these, I thought, were just excellent. Intelligence is a process enacted by interacting parts, not a property of individuals.
787268	806130	24	A	0.99999	13:07	37	Again, whatever that would even mean. Inaction is death. Being by doing action without prediction is reckless. No prediction without sense making. No sense made without a self versus the world or a self in the world.
806580	816770	25	A	1.0	13:26	22	A collective is differently intelligent than its members. Maybe trivially different, maybe better in every way, maybe another direction in every way.
818840	826740	26	A	0.99977	13:38	11	Why do individuals participate in collectives? Why are people in groups?
830220	861250	27	A	0.99926	13:50	65	Because sacrificing the autonomy to the collective provides benefit, survival, or even thrival benefits that's that I to we no making of sense without the self acting in or on the world. It's not just some essence that's disembodied. This is what embodiment is all about. An autonomous agent is a self organizing collective of parts. Parts of a collective can themselves be autonomous agents.
862020	893900	28	A	0.7795	14:22	73	Collectives form to improve the chance of survival of their members. And an agent in a collective benefits from the intelligence of the collective. So to me, this presentation and line of research pursued by JF and others absolutely puts a bow on the what is an individual, what is a collective? Why do we even talk about, quote, individuals or quote collectives when we recognize the multiscale nature of complex adaptive systems.
895920	930650	29	A	1.0	14:55	76	Third Perspective a Symbiotic view of Life we have never been individuals. This is a 2012 paper by Gilbert, SAP and Tower and just to read a few aspects of what they wrote in the abstract. The notion of the biological individual is crucial to studies of genetics, immunology, evolution, develop anatomy and physiology. Each of these biological subdisciplines has a specific conception of individuality which has historically provided conceptual context for integrating newly acquired data.
933260	973636	30	A	0.99945	15:33	90	Few descriptions animals cannot be considered individuals by anatomical or physiological criteria because a diversity of symbionts are both present and functional in completing metabolic pathways and serving other physiological functions. Similarly, these new studies have shown that animal development is incomplete without symbionts. Symbionts also constitute a second mode of genetic inheritance providing selectable genetic variation for natural selection which connects it to the evolutionary concept of an individual. So if we pursue the metabolic oh, it's all the metabolic networks and how they're all connected. That's the individual.
973738	987512	31	A	0.99938	16:13	40	All right. Well, that includes the microbiome and symbionts. Well, no, it's the physiology and the decision making and the neurophysiology. Those are also in play with the symbionts. Well, at least evolution only selects upon the germ line, right?
987566	1027360	32	A	0.99997	16:27	89	Well, no, actually there are these multiple mechanisms of inheritance whether they're relevant in a given situation or not is situational. But in principle they exist and they're increasingly coming to be recognized. Additionally for the immune system commonly described as quote, self versus non self or self identification or self other discrimination. After all, we talk about autografting and allografting. But of course there are aspects of quote, self or self under some definitions like an epitope from a protein in cartilage that an autoimmune disorder might target.
1027440	1079812	33	A	0.99998	17:07	108	So the immune system is mobilized against self under some definitions sometime and is not mobilized against other under some definitions sometimes. Like we're not constantly mounting a massive immune response to our gut microbiome. Our skin microbiome, recognizing the holobiont, the multicellular Eukaryote, plus its colonies of persistent symbionts as a critically important unit of anatomy, development, physiology, immunology and evolution and cognition, opens up a new investigative avenue and conceptually challenges the ways in which the biological subdisciplines have heretofore characterized living entities. Here we have the COVID of the famous work Leviathan. It's a large person constituted of other people really making the point clear.
1079866	1099420	34	A	0.99917	17:59	39	But if we zoomed in on, quote, an individual person wouldn't we find something like societies of cells? What is an individual? When is an individual? What and what's on the line? I thought those are such big questions.
1099570	1149692	35	A	0.99994	18:19	125	Maybe could we connect it to a little bit of more of a bibliographic piece of data just to show a snapshot and to open up this discussion to you all about what's on the line with what's an individual. And so what I did is I searched for some literature trends on PubMed and here is the results per 100,000 citations for collective behavior. And so we see collective behavior first being mentioned in the 1950s, at least in this literature database, and rising up on through around 500 or 400 or 500 per hundred thousand. So 1000 out of 100,000 would be 1%. So half of a percent of all the citations on a major biolytic literature database had collective behavior in them.
1149746	1174132	36	A	0.9983	19:09	75	So that's a huge amount of work, and it looks like it goes down. But when you actually look at how many citations there are, it's been about 4000 publications per year. It's just that the rest of the literature database may be expanding at a faster rate. So thousands of papers per year and an appreciable fraction of work has to do with collective behavior. And so I thought, wow, that's exciting, that's great.
1174186	1209280	37	A	0.99998	19:34	81	Well, how are we doing compared to behavior? Now, collective behavior is this lower line in red. And yeah, there's a Blip, but behavior is up between 15 and 20% of citations in PubMed. Now, maybe behavior is also referring to the behavior of a given material that may or may not be a superconductor or might be using different understandings of behavior. But what can we say and what can we know about the difference between individual and collective behavior?
1209860	1230640	38	A	1.0	20:09	52	Now, interestingly, here I searched for individual behavior as a specific term, so we see a lot lower. But individual behavior, I mean, can the tide have already turned? Can it really be the case that after 2020, this is a real meaningful decline? I don't know. It's too early to say.
1230730	1283524	39	A	0.99999	20:30	122	We can't do technical analysis just like that, but very provocative and gives us some ways to look at the broader scale or collective scientific cognitive process associated with these incredibly important philosophical and biological questions about individuality. Because, of course, to distinguish collective behavior from individual behavior, or why would you even need an adjective at all? It's going to come down to what is an individual and what's on the line so much. And the last view here, drawing upon the work morphology of collective intelligence network, swarm, multitude, or assemblage? And Tony Devorrow and Alejandro Lopez Gabrielis wrote, network, swarm and multitude are some of the different metaphors that have been used to understand the concept of collective intelligence.
1283652	1339956	40	A	0.90353	21:23	121	All of them have reflected our relationship with the Internet and its development. With the advent of artificial intelligence AI, we wonder about other metaphors that might offer a new understanding of collective intelligence to address today's environmental and sociotechnical challenges. They bring up network, swarm and multitude to advocate for the fourth option assemblage. Understanding collective intelligence as an assemblage allows for the inclusion of different human and technological agents and overcomes the anthropocentrism human centrism human exclusionism of other models based on human will, whether extended as in the multitude or suppressed as in the swarm connotations here. In this way, ethical decision making and responsibility are distributed among different cognitive actors with the capacity to choose and interpret.
1340148	1408240	41	A	1.0	22:20	148	And to the extent that they make decisions, albeit algorithmic ones, they are also accountable. And I love this, and I think it foreshadows where we're going to be going with active inference, which is different cognitive actors have the capacity to choose and interpret. We might connect that to sensory and internal states of an active inference agent. But perception, sense making, signal processing inbound information and decision making and responsibility and accountability and the accountability that we associate with human sociotechnical systems, that's the action selection, control theory, outgoing dependencies in the Markov blanket. So right there, coming from outside of active inference, we see the identification of the need to have flexible frameworks, including linguistic and metaphorical, that allow us to talk about heterogeneous diverse cyberphysical systems where different entities are engaged in different practices and ways of incoming sense making and outgoing decision making.
1408390	1439480	42	A	1.0	23:28	84	And it's going to turn out that active inference is an incredible and flexible expressive framework that's going to allow us to talk about those kinds of systems pointed to here. And it really matters. They point to some of the most important aspects of issues today on to active inference, insights and fundamentals. Well, here, as in all the other areas, there were so many pieces of literature that could have been drawn on. That's why I restricted myself to just four views.
1441580	1474608	43	A	0.99999	24:01	96	Also, this section is going to mark the midway point. We're not there yet, don't worry, but the midway point of the lecture where we move from the six declarative expressions onto the questions because it's more open than not and there's more space for you to respond than you may imagine. But the view is going to be here. And what are the literature that support that point? So, first, active inference in the free energy principle, which is a principle that provides a lot of theoretical grounding and physics based perspective on active inference.
1474624	1510720	44	A	0.99999	24:34	94	But we're not going to go too much into it today. Active inference and the free energy principle are scale free formalisms for cognitive systems with collectives, as with individuals, the general framing in itself does very little. However, with properly constructed generative models, we can get explanation, prediction, design, influence, and implementation tools. And here I'm going to draw on two pieces of work epistemic Communities under Active Inference by Mahault and colleagues in 2022 and just from several days ago, the work by Connor Hines and colleagues. Collective behavior from surprise minimization.
1512020	1546244	45	A	0.99761	25:12	85	We'll unpack the point more when we get there. Second, collectives can be understood as consisting of action perception loops which subsume, entail, or supervene upon individual level action perception loops, niche modification, stigma, g can also be modeled this way. We'll draw upon the paper Active Inference, an active inference framework for ant colony behavior by myself and colleagues in 2021. And then we'll move into the questions and things will start to open up. So if it feels like we've been climbing uphill.
1546292	1568000	46	A	0.58752	25:46	64	We're two thirds of the way with the uphill climb. Feels like we've been going downhill. We're two thirds of the way with a downhill how do the concepts of generalized synchrony and homeostasis, which are so core to active inference, relate to collective behavior? Here we'll discuss the work by Ralph Kaufman et al. From 2021, an active inference model of collective intelligence.
1568420	1608528	47	A	1.0	26:08	94	And lastly, in this section, how can active inference be used to explore the balance between individual and collective behaviors and the bi directional influence of collectives on individuals, and, of course, vice versa? Here we'll draw upon the computational boundary of a self developmental bioelectricity drives, multicellularity and scale free cognition by Mike Levin in 2019. So let's get right into the work by Mahault and Connor and colleagues. First, I'm just going to bring this paper up. However, first you can watch more about it in Guest stream 17.1 from March 2022.
1608614	1631904	48	A	0.99971	26:48	71	Here's two collectives right here. And also Mahault will be covering this work in a lot more detail later on in the course. I just wanted to bring it up because I think it's one of the exceptional examples that can be deployed to show like, hey, just thinking about the social as an active inference system is awesome. It's an intuition pump. It brings us into the active inference ecosystem.
1631952	1666032	49	A	0.99999	27:11	81	But then what do we do when we're there? And what we do when we're there is we develop generative models that actually take us towards where we want to be. Again, framing a situation as being related to active inference. Or you could do an active inference model of that does very, very little work by itself. However, making generative models of situations, even if they're speculative generative models or qualitative or hypothetical, that can start getting towards doing work.
1666086	1682612	50	A	0.99996	27:46	53	But if someone said, well, that health condition, you could do a linear regression. Okay, but which treatment do we do? Well, it could be done with a linear regression. We could use a linear regression to figure out what method to use. Okay, but more or less hotter room or colder room.
1682666	1704828	51	A	0.69278	28:02	71	Well, just use a linear regression. So that's the conversation that we're having a lot with active inference. A lot of times people are talking about whether a given situation can or cannot be modeled with active inference. Or, just in the abstract, what does active inference say about this situation? And again, the framework itself is general to the point of doing little work, and we love it that way.
1704994	1749820	52	A	0.99964	28:24	128	It enables us to move into systems of interest and deploy generative models. So what they did in this paper was leverage the active inference framework to provide an in silicon model on the computer chip model of confirmation bias and its effect on echo chamber formation. They had a system of interest people's social engagement on so called social media, and they had even a phenomena of interest which was echo chamber formation. They built a model based on active inference where agents tend to sample information in order to justify their own view of reality, something we call self evidencing. We show that once agents have reached a certain level of certainty about their beliefs, it becomes very difficult to get them to change their views.
1750400	1778740	53	A	0.98	29:10	98	The system of self confirming beliefs is upheld and reinforced by the evolving relationship between an agent's beliefs and observations, which will, over time, will continue to provide evidence for their ingrained ideas about the world. Well, where I'm from, we drive on the right side of the road and so you drive on the right side of the road, I drive on the right side of the road. We're not going to have an issue. Everywhere I look, I see cars moving around, I see people passing on the right, on the sidewalk. It's all making sense.
1778810	1814050	54	A	0.99997	29:38	80	We're bounding surprise. We're doing active inference. Surprising minimization goals, reward never need to come into play to give an account of how those systems could arise and be stabilized. These epistemic communities are consolidated by those shared beliefs and in turn tend to produce perceptions of reality that reinforce those shared beliefs. And on the top right is just a little teaser of what a Bayesian graphical model looks like of the kind that they deployed in this paper.
1816980	1877510	55	A	1.0	30:16	148	And here we see some of the results from their parameter sweeping, exploring different combinations of parameters and looking at topics like polarization index and reattenance rate and so all kinds of statistics that can be drawn upon, connected to the generative model and also all kinds of opportunities and interfaces to relate this to empirical data as well as suggest experiments. So Mahault is going to talk more about this and it's awesome work. And then late breaking news only several days ago, five or so days ago, an amazing new pre [unk]print was put up by Connor Hines and colleagues and it was just too cool not to include here and reflects the very rapid pace of collaborative development in the active inference ecosystem. And this is their work collective behavior from surprise minimization. And they made every point I wanted to make here and now.
1878360	1911628	56	A	0.99981	31:18	65	Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature. Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized local interactions among constituent components e. G, individual fish in a school there's that word individual again. Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self propelled particles, subject to self generated motion and social forces such as short range repulsion and long range attraction or alignment. However, organisms are not particles.
1911804	1939284	57	A	0.99993	31:51	62	They are probabilistic decision makers. They're cognitive particles. We introduce an approach to modeling collective behavior based on active inference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative to minimize surprise. Again, if you want to, you can contrast that with reward learning, where the imperative is to maximize reward in active inference and the free energy principle.
1939412	1966450	58	A	0.75622	32:19	77	We're taking a path of least action not the laziest path or the most passive one, but a little bit more technically a path of least action. And we're minimizing surprise. We're bounding surprise with variational free energy and it turns out that that helps us minimize surprise and maximize model evidence. And it can include things like novelty and curiosity seeking very naturally. So this doesn't mean we're squeezing the juice out of life at all.
1967480	2024820	59	A	0.99975	32:47	119	We demonstrate that many empirically observed collective phenomena including cohesion milling and directed motion emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents. No reward, no goal, no master of the collective. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring the parameter space of the beliefbased model we reveal nontrivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty, metacognition beliefs about beliefs determine collective decision making accuracy.
2025480	2035530	60	A	1.0	33:45	33	What if when you voted or shared your perspective on what we were going to have for dinner you also conveyed an uncertainty estimate? How confident are you about that being the case?
2037980	2072336	61	A	0.99999	33:57	85	Finally, we show how agents can update their generative model over time resulting in groups that are collectively more sensitive to external fluctuations and encode information more robustly. From a distributed systems perspective you could imagine two different kinds of distributed systems or networks. One of them has a dampening like quality. So something that enters on one side dampens as it diffuses. We can also contrast that with another kind of distributed system or another kind of input or stimulus or context that amplifies.
2072528	2118956	62	A	1.0	34:32	113	And the goal or one nice property to have of systems would be like we want to dampen what we don't want to pay attention to and up signal or increase the cascading availability of what we do want to attend to. Now that's a little circular since in some ways that's the definition of attention. However, making unified models like they do here gives us integrated approaches to explore a broad range of collective phenomena here in spatial movement but also involving the cognitive states of the particles. And they make a really nice representation here to connect to other approaches. A traditional approach to classical self propelled particles is agent environment.
2119068	2151368	63	A	0.99889	35:19	79	Agents take rules and they make decisions based upon those rules that are either given or learnt. When you're this close to the bird next to you, do that and when you're this close, do this. And then social forces are these kind of as if or actual constraints that then modify the agent's perspective. And what we see in the active inference setting is that the agent and the environment are mediated by an interface. The Markov blanket.
2151464	2173190	64	A	0.99989	35:51	60	This is. The sensorium. This is on the inbound side perception and on the outbound side action. And they give some more details. It's a really exciting paper and it's just cool to see again that even in the preparatory days of a lecture like this, there's always new collective activity in the ecosystem and that's what makes it fun.
2177080	2213904	65	A	0.62698	36:17	76	Last of the declarative sections of this lecture. Colonies here, but more generally collectives, can be understood as consisting of action perception loops which subsume, entail or supervene upon individual level action perception loops, niche modifications or stigma. G can also be modeled this way. What we did in this paper was bring something new to active inference in at least two different ways. First, it was the first model of an ant system of interest.
2214022	2265036	66	A	1.0	36:54	127	Now, for some of us mere mycologists in the audience, all of our broader entomology colleagues, that may be enough. But what was also really interesting about this work and the opportunity to collaborate on it, was it was the first active inference model presented with explicit stigmaji. Not just the philosophical consideration of the traces that agents leaving in the environment might then have them change their behavior in the future, but explicitly engaging with this process of multiagent stigmurgic behavior. Active inference may be informative in the study of ant colonies at three distinct temporal scales. Nest mate behavior, which is to say emergent among tissues of a nest mate, you could keep on going collectively down and interactions with the biotic or abiotic environment.
2265148	2296284	67	A	0.99998	37:45	87	So, first level at the level of a nest mate, one of those things with six legs that looks like an insect, at the level of the colony, colony development is emergent among nest mates and their interactions with the niche. That is where many people would traditionally assign collective behavior. They say, well, one nest mate walking around is individual behavior, that's the individual ants. And then the colony is where collective behavior comes into play, right? And we're going to see that reified very soon.
2296482	2347464	68	A	0.99999	38:16	133	But lastly, we point to the evolution of populations, which is an emergent outcome amongst colonies within an ecology. In this work, we focused on the connection between the first two levels of analysis, focusing on the case of stigmergic colony foraging using a modification of previous active inference computational implementations. We didn't use the word individual and there's a reason why. Because we're saying what we mean more clearly when talking about ants, when we talk about nest mates, colonies and populations of colonies that sidesteps or transcends the discussion of what is an individual and what is a collective. Because with respect to the colony as an individual, if you want to use that word, the population is a collective with respect to the nest mate, the colony is a collective.
2347592	2376900	69	A	0.99997	39:07	78	With respect to the tissue like the brain or the mid gut, the nest mate is a collective. So we don't need to play the adjective game. We can just articulate what we're interested in about these systems of interest and complex adaptive system phenomena. And so what we did was we explored a kind of classical behavioral setting which is food being placed between the arms of a teammates and in this case, rather than a rat.
2379400	2419716	70	A	0.54212	39:39	97	I'm just pausing for a second while I believe that my internet is reconnecting and we should be back. Each ant was described by an action perception loop, an active inference action perception loop. And they were able to move within a three by three grid as well as perceive pheromone density within a three by three grid. And then they laid down pheromone, they added stigmaergic trace on the way home if they had found a seed. And so this does a few interesting things and livestream 29 is where we unpack this a lot more.
2419738	2444264	71	A	1.0	40:19	74	But I just wanted to make two more points here. The first is that in a reward centric perspective on ant behavior, the pheromone is seen as a semiotic queue and the seed or the food is seen as the reward. And so then we got to use the cues, we got to use the pheromone density to figure out where the good stuff is. That's that paradigm. We flipped that with active inference.
2444392	2495660	72	A	1.0	40:44	126	Now, the preference we don't need to say reward, but the preference, that which is sought after proximally but teleologically, that which is sought after preferred over is the pheromone. The seed becomes the semiotic cue that it's time to turn on your pheromone depositing and come home. And so that flips our approach to understanding what foraging is about from we're lost in the sauce, trying to figure out where the good thing is out there to we're surfing the 100 foot wave and we'll know it when we see it, and then we'll turn around. Very different perspective. And then one other point that I had to make for the context was that we used a modification of a previous active inference computational implementation.
2496000	2548860	73	A	0.99909	41:36	109	What was the paper that we drew from? In fact, it was the acquisition of culturally patterned attention styles under active inference with Axel and Alex et al. And what this paper did was they looked at the situation of visual foraging on a vase, a piece of pottery, where the eye was only able to perceive a three by three matrix of pixels. And then the eye scanned around looking to recognize broader patterns that were then culturally acquired. So maybe one culture or one subculture likes the checkerboard pattern and another one likes vertical lines, another one likes horizontal lines or these other kinds of repetitive structures.
2550320	2596508	74	A	0.80334	42:30	119	What's so interesting is that the eye, when it is foraging, does not leave a trace, though it can feel like it, doesn't it? But the eye forges around in order to get the bigger picture based on local information. What we did is we said, well, instead of imagining that as the gaze location of an eye. Let's imagine that as the skin in the game exoskeleton on the ground of a forager. So let's think about that movement as something that an embodied forager does with its real body and then conditional in this setting upon it touching the seed or the food, it can lay down a pheromone trail, which the eyes can't do per se.
2596674	2620150	75	A	0.68	43:16	60	And so just really interesting because it's not like this was an ant paper and now we're going to try to cram it into social sciences. It's actually like computational work in the social sciences was able to translate to Mirmacology into ants research. And so it's a very fruitful and bi directional relationship between studying ants and studying people.
2622200	2650652	76	A	0.76	43:42	78	Now we're going to move into the openness of questions in this second half of the lecture. So how do the concepts of generalized synchrony and homeostasis, which are core to active inference, relate to collective behavior? And here we can draw upon the work by Ralph Kaufman, Pranav Gupta and Jacob Taylor from 2021 called inactive inference model of collective intelligence. And this was also unpacked in Gestream Nine. And so here's a little collective over here.
2650786	2709600	77	A	1.0	44:10	130	And that was about two years ago, way back when what they did in this paper was they considered a setting with two trolley cars moving around a wheel. And so here's how they contextualize that work. Formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local scale interactions between autonomous subsystem components individuals and global scale behavior of the composite system, the collective. So they do a really great job staking out what they mean by individual and collective. In this paper, we use the active inference formulation AIF, a framework for explaining the behavior of any non equilibrium steady state system at any scale deposit, a minimal agent based model that simulates the relationship between local individual level interaction and collective intelligence.
2710340	2745204	78	A	0.99997	45:10	68	Then they had a really creative approach to disentangling how different capacities translated to different collective outcomes. And here's what they did. We explore the effects of providing baseline active inference agents. Model one with specific cognitive capabilities, model two added in a theory of mind, model three added in goal alignment, and model four added both theory of mind and goal alignment. What does that look like?
2745342	2792408	79	A	0.99999	45:45	89	Again, we're not going to go into all the technical details here, but broadly, this is what it looked like. Here was their simplest baseline active inference formulation case. And then in the subsequent experiments, they added in either one or the other or both of the cognitive capacities that they described. They studied the single DIAD case and they very cleverly expanded that into a large scale multidiad case. They utilized their own representation of the octave inference partition in order to facilitate the construction of this model.
2792574	2824656	80	A	0.99	46:32	61	And so in this case, we see the blanket with the sensory states coming in, the active states going out. Markov blanket. Here we see the environment and then internal belief states or cognitive states. So very cool work that helps us get a vocabulary around, not shut the book on, but focus on. How do different agents come to synchronize?
2824848	2867992	81	A	1.0	47:04	94	What is generalized synchrony? Well, it doesn't mean Lockstep turntaking is generalized synchrony, because these two agents, the time that they're talking, has very high mutual information on the other, even though the correlation with their speaking might be negative, agent A is speaking when B is not, and vice versa. So from a linear regression perspective, there's a negative correlation. But from a mutual information perspective, where you can't ever have below zero information, at worst it's just noise. You always have zero or positive amount of information of systems about other systems.
2868156	2907804	82	A	1.0	47:48	96	And so that opens the door to understanding generalized synchrony, which is a broader conception of how individuals and collectives are interacting. And homeostasis. Maybe we could even imagine that these are multiple cells in the pancreas and they're trying to coordinate on insulin sensitivity. Or maybe this is multiple people who are securing the defense of a community and they also need to coordinate synchronously and asynchronously. And so there's a lot of ways in which this very, very lightweight apparatus of the active inference partition helps us bring together and compose all these cool.
2907842	2925780	83	A	0.99998	48:27	53	What ifs? Well, what if it had theory of mind? What if it had goal alignment? What if agents had theory of mind and goal alignment? What if we put them in a five x seven grid and then we did this and and that's what we get to do with active inference.
2926120	2982890	84	A	0.65	48:46	134	And lastly here, how can active inference be used to explore the balance between individual and collective behavioral and the bi directional influence of collectives on individuals? And so here I draw upon the amazing and singular work of Professor Mike Levin, who wrote the computational boundary of a self developmental bioelectricity drives multicellularity and scale free cognition in 2019. This was also explored in Livestream 25 series. So, just to pull out a few of the great pieces of this article, and there's a stigmaic trail of many other papers for those who follow, professor Levin writes, I propose a definition of an individual based on its information processing structure. The scale and types of goals that a system can pursue, defines or determines the boundaries and the content of the putative agent.
2984220	3036612	85	A	1.0	49:44	108	On this view, what defines a coherent, unified self out of its constituents, components and the surrounding environment is the set of parts that operate towards reaching specific goal states. So this is a teleological or a functional or anticipatory or sentient or adaptive or informational concept on individuals, which we can add to the earlier consideration raised by Gilbert et al. Here they discuss some of the more mechanistic biological considerations like genetics, immunology, evolution, development, anatomy, and physiology. What Levin has done here, and consistent with this, is the informational theory of individuality by David Krakauer et al. Is connect this more generally to system capacity.
3036756	3087364	86	A	0.99	50:36	105	And so there is what is here represented as like a time diamond, where the scope or the scale of the system in the now is like the radius or the circumference on this diamond. And then the part of the diamond that recedes off into the past, that's retained from the past, is memory and history. And the part that advances or pretends into the future is the anticipatory or the planning capacity. This opens the door to describing diverse intelligences, including possible alien artificial intelligence or synthetic intelligences, as well as nested or compound intelligences. So here the example is the ant colony.
3087492	3132752	87	A	0.99992	51:27	92	So here we have cells, these little pinkish diamonds nested within a nest mate, which is the green diamond nested within the colony, which is the blue diamond. Now, notice that the nest mate is called an organism. I couldn't help but to connect this to Wheeler 1911, whose work is the Ant Colony as an organism. Superorganism came later. The superorganismal framing on the ant colony reifies the concept that the nest mate is the individual or the organism, because why else would you need to call the colony a superorganism?
3132816	3161920	88	A	1.0	52:12	88	I mean, I think colonies are super. I think it's great to call them whatever you want to call them, and they probably don't mind either. But the idea that a superorganism is composed of other organisms means that the nest mate is an organism. Whereas this diagram, in my perspective, would be as accurate or more to say nest mate here, because under different concepts of organismality, which is to say individuality, if we want to connect it there, the colony can be considered as the organism.
3164980	3206876	89	A	0.99	52:44	109	And of the so many other pieces of this work that are fun to bring out, the way that Levin clarifies his assumptions gives us, first off, some planks that we can jump off of for good and helps us come to terms with maybe like, what do we assume about behavior, about collective behavior? How do we want to show up when we're studying collective behavior in general and when we're studying social behavior? After all, we're in active inference for the social sciences. And so Levin writes, the ideas are explored here from the perspective of the following three core assumptions. First is a commitment to evolution.
3206988	3248316	90	A	0.99999	53:26	108	Every capacity has a natural history and emerged from simpler variants. Second, it is assumed that all metaphors are to be judged by their utility in driving scientific progress. There is not a binary categorization of scientific pictures which should be taken literally or not, which can be decided a priori upfront. Third, much of the discussion centers around goals related to teleology. A hotly debated topic here, goal directedness is taken in the nonmagical cybernetic engineering and control theory sense of a feedback system that operates to maximize some specific state of affairs, which can be modeled as a dynamical system with attractors in its state space.
3248418	3304510	91	A	1.0	54:08	115	And later work by Levin and Fields and others expanded this concept of intelligence just to phenomenal heights and flavors. So active inference helps us understand that cognitive glue maybe it's mechanistically enacted by bioelectricity in a given system or at a given scale, but active inference gives us the analytical glue to approach those systems with an open mind and an open scaffold. And so those are some of the insights and fundamentals of active inference as applied to collective behavioral systems. Now on to the last third of this lecture applications and Implications of Active Inference for the Social Sciences regarding collective behavior. This is really where it is wide, wide, wide open.
3306820	3340068	92	A	0.99834	55:06	83	What kinds of insights can active inference offer about the role of learning, adaptation, conflict, and cooperation in collective behavior? And how can we approach that from a cognitive security perspective? Here we'll draw on the work of Scott David and colleagues, active Inference in Modeling Conflict what implications does active inference have on the study of human collective behavior, particularly in social, economic, and digital contexts? Here we'll draw on the work by Poirier et al. Communication as socially extended active inference.
3340164	3364288	93	A	0.96891	55:40	48	An ecological approach to communicative behavior livestream. 48 series what considerations that are relevant for thinking about assemblages and interactions? What considerations are relevant for thinking about assemblages and interactions among different entities in cognitive ecosystems? Here we'll turn to the work of Friston et al. Et al.
3364374	3396120	94	A	0.88	56:04	72	2022, designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles and how does active inference accommodate collective behavior within and across generations? And here we'll look at a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics by Friston et al. In 2023. So when it comes to applications and implications of active inference in social sittings and settings, again, there's so much to do, there's so much to learn. So we welcome everybody who's curious.
3396200	3413276	95	A	0.99996	56:36	45	This is the time to write your live chats, submit your questions, prepare yourself to explore, and to be an active forager in this space. And if you're listening, you know that you already are. So in the work. Active inference in modeling conflict. Scott.
3413308	3445304	96	A	0.99955	56:53	83	David RJ. Corday and myself asked what kinds of insights can active inference offer about the role of learning, adaptation, conflict and cooperation in collective behavior? Now, as with all these other papers, there's always so many things that can be said. What we did is we tried to connect beyond the very classical Markov blanket and agent environment partitioning, which we've seen many, many times. We tried to connect this to the specific kind of generative models that we use in modeling.
3445432	3481968	97	A	0.99577	57:25	91	So here we led early by clarifying, this is what we're talking about with active inference, generative models. It's not like something I'm hiding in my pocket and maybe I'll show you if you say the shibolith. This is what we're talking about when we're talking about applying active inference models to social settings. It's a discrete time generative model here just a motif. We applied that kind of generative model architecture to one of the most well known models of sense making and decision making, which is the UDA loop.
3482064	3507916	98	A	0.93027	58:02	75	Observe, orient, decide, act by John Boyd Now this may seem to some like a quite sparse framework. Like, yeah, you get the observation, you figure it out, you make a decision, you take the action. It doesn't do that much work by itself either. However, UDA is used in tactical and strategic settings every single day. And so we wanted to connect OODA loop to the generative models that we use in active inference.
3507948	3536952	99	A	1.0	58:27	73	And so we highlighted on the generative model where different stages of the OODA loop occur. Perception happens in the sensory states. Cognition or the orientation happens in the perceptual inference, the downstairs of that part of the figure. And then decision making happens in the upstairs with the expected free energy calculation in this case. And finally action is selected and enacted and that results in impact and the cycle begins again.
3537086	3580180	100	A	1.0	58:57	101	Now, in active inference it's more like an unfolding flow, but to a first pass approximation it does the trick. Why does that really matter that we understand the mechanics of decision making? Well, we're talking about active inference in the social setting. That means we're talking about two sophisticated cognitive entities, maybe two businesses, maybe two individual humans, maybe a person and a business, maybe different kinds of systems that we don't even know about or we haven't even seen yet. And that generative model is the internal states that is then participating in this minimal dyadic collective behavioral encounter.
3580860	3620048	101	A	0.99883	59:40	96	We can expand that to thinking about commons resource, commons attention, commons open source ecosystems. And for this we utilized one of Scott David's favorite acronyms of which he has so so many, which is Bolts business, Operation, Legal, Technical and Social. Bolts is not an exhaustive acronym, otherwise we would need everything. But it's a heuristic that encourages us to think holistically about different systems. Let's just say that we were a business or a person and we wanted to see if a given policy was a good way to go to complete our mission.
3620224	3639784	102	A	1.0	1:00:20	54	And it looks good, except it can't be done operationally. Well then that has to be taken into account or everything works out but it's illegal. That's not the way to go. Everything works out, but the business doesn't check out. It's not going to be sustainable financially or technically it can't be done.
3639822	3670124	103	A	0.99997	1:00:39	78	Or socially it's not palatable. All of these features of sociotechnical systems, which again we just make a little mnemonic of with Bolts need to be taken into account for comprehensive and high integrity, high reliability systems design. In this setting we have entity A and entity B interacting through the Bolts niche. They each have their own blanket states sense in action. And the niche where those nest mates were laying their pheromones, the niche is bolts.
3670252	3698684	104	A	0.99	1:01:10	85	And so you could make a restricted model where it's just two entities engaged in a financial dealing, just a business only engaging on B. Or you could think of this multidomain full spectrum situation in terms of bolts. Then you would have a larger and a more complex interface between these two entities. But we also wanted to think about the case where there might be cooperation between these entities or there might be conflict. And so here we have entity A and B.
3698722	3728352	105	A	1.0	1:01:38	78	The Dyad is in the spotlight. Entity C is a non belligerent state or it's a bystander, or it's a witness, or it's a referee, or it's a friend, or it's a colleague. But entity C is also engaging only through their blanket states on bolts. And lastly, we connect it to the Abiotic niche which may not care how much you're buying or selling a gallon of oil for. The abiotic niche may have its own dynamics.
3728416	3764140	106	A	0.99999	1:02:08	92	We may use active inference to model that or we might use some other approach to model it. And so this sets a really, really general state space for us to understand conflict and cooperation and where we situated that work. Lastly, here was in relationship to other work exploring strategic and tactical decision making and so on. The lower end of this image are tactical and operational frameworks that are used in decision making. On the top are strategic or scholarly frameworks that are used for more of like geopolitical considerations.
3764300	3825408	107	A	1.0	1:02:44	137	And then from left to right we have more qualitative approaches going to more formal and quantitative approaches. And we believe that the application of active inference through this type of model, the active inference conflict model, helps us touch the qualitative natural language and graphical composable aspects and the quantitative and formal aspects as well. And similarly, through nested decision making cycles we can talk about tactical operational activities and the broader nested strategy just like we looked at the nested cones from Professor Levin's work. Next, what implications does active inference have on the study of human collective behavior, particularly in social, economic and digital contexts? Well, there's a lot to say about this, but Tisson and Pore wrote in 2021 the paper communication as socially extended active inference, an ecological approach to communicative behavior.
3825504	3882520	108	A	0.98	1:03:45	120	And this was in the Livestream 48 series. Here's Remy raising his hand so that we knew that he wanted to speak. They introduced an ecological account of communication according to which acts of communication are active inference achieved by affecting the behavior of a target organism via the modification of its field of affordances. Constraining a target organism's behavior constitutes a mechanism of socially extended active inference allowing organisms to proactively regulate their interstates through the behavior of other organisms. In this general conception of communication, the type of cooperative communication characteristic of human communicative interaction is a way of constraining interaction dynamics towards the goals of a given joint action by constructing and altering shared fields of affordances.
3883020	3934792	109	A	1.0	1:04:43	127	This account embraces a pragmatist view, according to which communication is a form of action aiming to influence the behavior of a target and stands against the traditional transmission view, according to which communication fundamentally serves to convey information. Understanding acts of communication as active inference under an ecological interpretation allows us to link communicative and ultimately linguistic behavior to the biological imperative of minimizing free energy and to emphasize the action oriented nature of communicative interaction. This is really a rich and excellent work that Remy and Pierre produced, and there are several pieces that I think add a lot of meaning and value to the ways that we think about communication. But most broadly, what is communication for? Who do we talk to and why?
3934926	3955260	110	A	0.78858	1:05:34	41	What do we like to talk about and why? Why would anyone say that? And why? How does technique, considered broadly, technology and technique, whether it's digital or social or cultural technique, mediate and influence communication? The media is the message.
3955410	3978676	111	A	1.0	1:05:55	55	The medium is the message. And think about everything in that area, too. And how can active inference, beyond just giving these incredible composable formal tools, how can we think about joint action and co modification of fields of affordances? Hey, could you pick that up from that shelf? Okay, I'll open it for you.
3978778	3991720	112	A	1.0	1:06:18	38	Now let's hand it to our friend who's going to make the food. All of these ways in which individuals shape each other's field of affordances is something that we can talk about really fluidly within active inference.
3994400	4033668	113	A	0.99761	1:06:34	78	Penultimate View what considerations are relevant for thinking about assemblages and interactions among different entities in cognitive ecosystems? So here was a large multi author paper from Karl Friston et al. And The Versus Colleagues designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles from December 2022. And the big picture as I see it here is what is the role of the social sciences after all the course that we're in now in ecosystems of diverse heterogeneous? Synthetic intelligences.
4033844	4063692	114	A	0.80292	1:07:13	66	By synthetic intelligences, I refer to assemblages with intelligence, whether it's natural or artificial. Leave that debate for another day, because in their application, we're talking about synthetic intelligence. Synthetic intelligence needs cognitive security. Cognitive security needs cognitive science. And they began this paper with the following this white paper presents active inference as an approach to research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.
4063756	4119536	115	A	0.92	1:07:43	124	AI artificial with the aim of developing ecosystems of natural and artificial intelligences. The path forward in AI is often presented as progressing from systems that are able to solve problems within one narrow domain, artificial narrow intelligence ANI to systems that are able to solve problems in a domain general manner at or beyond human levels, what are known as artificial general intelligence, AGI, and artificial superintelligence ASI. We believe that approaching ASI or for reasons outlined below, even AGI likely requires an understanding of networked or collective intelligence. Now, intelligence in action is behavior. So we're talking about collective behavior and they laid out their timeline and the stages that they see in terms of sentient, sophisticated, sympathetic and finally shared intelligences.
4119728	4179964	116	A	0.99999	1:08:39	123	But I think it's worth to dwell a moment on the one figure of this paper. Figure one belief updating on a statistical manifold. And so here we have some curve in an information geometric space, it's a parameter space of a probability distribution. And on this manifold, on this line on a plane, lower dimensional manifold projection, there's a temporal process belief at time t, T plus one, T plus two, where initially this gaussian that's very distributed becomes updated to a sharper peak distribution that's going to be resting basically at some special point on this curve. Whether you're very familiar with accelerated optimization on information geometric manifolds or not, it's really interesting to consider why they went with this image.
4180112	4221996	117	A	1.0	1:09:40	90	And for those again who are familiar or just coming to be familiar with some of the formalisms of active inference, this is what this very talented and transdisciplinary team went with when seeking to provide some of the only nontextual descriptions of their work. So I think it's really interesting and the big question is, well, what is the social reassembling the social Bruno La Tour, what is the social? What is social? Does social mean only adult humans talking with each other? Does social include non human species?
4222188	4262412	118	A	0.97229	1:10:22	92	Does social include non biological intelligences? These are all things that are not just questions of theory. So connecting flexible extensible frameworks like active inference and all that comes along with it to this bigger question about applications and implications of applied active inference in the social setting. That's what I hope we can explore in the questions at the end of this live stream and in the discussions that we have in a couple of weeks and ongoing. And lastly, how does active inference accommodate collective behavioral within and across generations?
4262556	4339080	119	A	0.99	1:11:02	146	And so here I'll draw on the recent work a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics with Karl Friston, myself and others. And we had two images in this work which otherwise had a lot of prose and formalism. On the left, we see that active inference, particular partition, external states, internal states, blanket states, here at the organismal level, one worm, and in an enested deeper system, the population, which gives rise to the starting positionality of the organisms. Think about drawing an organism from a gene pool, from a birth pool and the impact that those organisms have on the bigger picture, maybe it's a bacteria that is fermenting so it changes the PH or the ethanol concentration of the Kombucha. That is this kind of multiscale interaction that we believe provides an approach to understanding ecoevo devo, ecology, evolution and developmental interactions.
4339420	4383384	120	A	0.97	1:12:19	88	And the other visualization that we use here is of nested systems. So contrast that with the kind of time diamond that we saw from Mike Levin. Now here, imagine that we're going to cut across the. Center of this diamond and now it's going to look like a muscle fiber fibers of fibers, because we have, let's just say this outer blue line may be the colony. And then each of these smaller entities is an estimate and they're composed of cells, and cells have constituents too.
4383582	4427536	121	A	0.52	1:13:03	97	And here we utilized the apparatus of the renormalization group which draws upon physics to articulate the separation of scales. So that we can be clear when are we talking about multiscale systems which we can articulate and renormalize across vertically to use an encultured metaphor? And then within a given scale of analysis, what is the lateral or collective behavior? So how do we get those interactions amongst nest mates that are both constrained by the colony top down? Again, using a spatial and encultured metaphor top down scaffolded or enabled or constrained by the colony.
4427568	4457920	122	A	0.99981	1:13:47	67	But then what nest mates do matters and that influences the colony. And we used a few new pieces of formalism primarily developed by Coral to help express that setting. And again, we think it's going to be really useful for describing otherwise quite challenging scenarios in ecology, evolution and development. And so we come right back to that what is a self? What about nested selves?
4459460	4494456	123	A	1.0	1:14:19	76	And with that, I turn to some open questions. What can be said other than there are so many open questions to discuss? There's many things we can explore in the discussion that I'll be facilitating in a couple of weeks. And of course, beyond we have a coda interface for you to submit questions that all the course teachers will take a look at and give their best attempt on. And conversation is collective behavior.
4494568	4527510	124	A	1.0	1:14:54	74	Now, sure, keeping it inside of your head is also collective behavior, no matter how you think about it. But when we enact in the social, then we're really making it happen. So with that, I will just show my citations and the slides will be shared too. Also, there's some extra readings that various individuals along the way suggested to me. So that includes social ecologies and abductive logic enacting like a state.
4527960	4547736	125	A	1.0	1:15:27	55	These are not the titles. The titles are inactive. Dynamic Social Cognition and Active Inference. That was livestream 47 thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds. That Was Livestream 33 Active Inference applicability to different kinds of social Organizations explained through reference to industrial engineering and quality Management.
4547768	4572980	126	A	0.99989	1:15:47	57	That was live stream 27 resonating minds emergent collaboration through hierarchical active inference. Yellow Broomberg's and Eric Wrightvel's work on self organization, free energy minimization and optimal grip on a field of affordances. And the well known Thinking through Other Minds work by Vesier et al. Thinking through other minds. A variational approach to cognition and culture.
4574920	4618080	127	A	0.99695	1:16:14	104	Well, I hope this has been an interesting and relevant lecture for you. It was fun to prepare. There are so many perspectives and so much territory that there's a lot in collective behavior. But again, I'm just really looking forward to the discussion that we can have in a couple of weeks. I encourage you, whether you're listening on your timeline and at a moment that enables you to join that live conversation, I would encourage you to join or to join the live stream so you can participate through chat or whether you want to find some other way to get involved.
4619380	4627180	128	A	0.99916	1:16:59	19	It's been a great time, and with that, I will close. Thank you very much. Until next time. Bye.
