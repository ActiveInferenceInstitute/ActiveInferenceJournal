7860	8930	2	A	0.99989	Hello everyone.
9700	12928	3	A	0.99998	It is August 2, 2023.
13094	16768	4	A	0.99976	We're in the active inference for the Social Sciences course.
16934	22796	5	A	0.95267	I'm Daniel Friedman, and this is going to be a lecture on collective behavior.
22988	35572	6	A	1	Now of course, disclaimers could abound and there's so many ways to go about this topic of collective behavior that in duality, in enactment, I really hope it is multi scale and collective.
35716	42104	7	A	0.88346	I'm really looking forward to your comments and your engagement with this area, with this lecture, with this course.
42222	48670	8	A	0.99386	So if you're watching Live, you can add comments into the live chat or questions and I'll check them out at the end.
49040	59330	9	A	0.99995	Also in the YouTube live chat and in the video description, there is a link to where you can submit questions for all of the teachers of this course.
60180	62016	10	A	0.99837	That's going to be a coda form.
62198	68628	11	A	0.79	And just more generally, let's have fun enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence together.
68794	77220	12	A	1	And I hope that this lecture can be something like one attempt to make that happen.
77370	83800	13	A	0.55291	epistemically, we're going to have many fun things to talk about collective behavior.
84460	87012	14	A	0.99996	What differentiates it from simply behavior?
87076	90948	15	A	1	I mean, aren't all behaving systems assemblages?
91124	95704	16	A	0.99932	Is not the brain composed of multiple parts, brain and body, multiple people?
95822	98312	17	A	0.99996	What are we really talking about with individual behavior?
98376	101020	18	A	0.99993	Why do we need adjectives at all for behavior?
101520	105404	19	A	0.99991	What is a collective and how would we even know it except through its behavior?
105452	107920	20	A	0.73643	So there's going to be all kinds of fun topics.
110340	117628	21	A	0.92314	Avel provided me with this image and suggested that it would be a great place to head towards.
117814	120308	22	A	1	And so we can think of this as where we're going.
120394	144388	23	A	0.53	And where we're going is understanding the agent or the human in a social relationship through social action and the recipient of social constraints and observations through that interface or blanket or holographic screen, the agent or the human is engaging on this sociocultural landscape.
144564	150408	24	A	1	And so we can think about that agent of engagement with a social world and the dynamic of sociocultural constraints.
150504	155484	25	A	1	Now that's where we're going, and that's how someone else has framed where we're going.
155682	159548	26	A	0.99999	What I'll tell you here is how we're getting there, how we're getting there.
159634	161168	27	A	0.99989	It's going to be a lot of fun.
161254	165456	28	A	0.9999	There's going to be a lot of ants, and the door is going to be wide open.
165558	178820	29	A	0.99992	So everyone is an estimate on this slide and we're going to be with our regimes of attention and our stigmaergic trails just absolutely up, down, left, right, all over this sociocultural landscape.
179480	184680	30	A	0.9928	All right, so here's the plan for the collective behavior lecture.
185180	188500	31	A	0.99887	It's going to be presented as a sequence of views.
188660	199500	32	A	1	Each view or perspective is going to consist of at very least a central citation and then one or more reflections on that citation.
200640	208940	33	A	0.91	Four views on collective behavior taken as a bundle will constitute a main section of this lecture.
209100	221040	34	A	1	And there are going to be three main sections of this lecture split on one hand into three groups of four and on the other hand into two groups of six splitting into fours.
221120	238090	35	A	1	The main three sections are going to be background and Context, which is going to provide some views and insights that are from outside of active inference because surprise, surprise, what was true before active inference or outside of active inference is also true within and after.
238780	240580	36	A	0.99997	Then we're going to turn to active inference.
240660	255650	37	A	0.87179	Specifically, we're going to talk about active inference insights and fundamentals for collective behavior and applications and implications of utilizing or of conceptualizing of a social system as an active inference system.
256180	266816	38	A	0.99994	So those second two sections are each going to center around also specific recent work in the field to split it into two groups of six.
266998	286184	39	A	1	The first six views that are presented so all of background and context and then half of the insights and fundamentals are going to be in support linguistically or rhetorically of a declarative statement, whereas the latter six views are going to support or open up to a question.
286382	292170	40	A	1	And that'll lead us to the final section, the fourth section, which is some open questions.
292620	298620	41	A	1	At that time, I will look at the live chat and review any questions or thoughts that people have.
298770	307970	42	A	1	And I'll also just open the door and leave it open with asking questions, because that's something that we're going to be engaged in for so long.
308340	312400	43	A	0.99995	So let's go right into the first section, background and context.
313060	317600	44	A	0.99999	Here are the four views and the four declarative statements.
318840	319952	45	A	0.99995	Big picture.
320096	333908	46	A	0.99997	Many, if not all of the concepts, discussions, questions and views on collective behavior from before or outside of active inference also apply after or inside active inference or in the active inference ecosystem.
334084	341412	47	A	1	And so to support and to build out that point, I'm going to talk about four different works and some takeaways.
341556	345020	48	A	1	First, watching behavior is complex.
345600	348636	49	A	1	Here we'll look at Deborah Gordon's 1992 paper.
348738	350510	50	A	0.86771	Wittgenstein and Ant watching.
351280	357276	51	A	1	Second, all intelligence is Collective Intelligence, which was a presentation of the same name by J.
357298	357484	52	A	0.71	F.
357522	361570	53	A	0.08321	Klaudier earlier this year, referencing a paper of the same name.
361940	362784	54	A	1	Third.
362982	364940	55	A	0.99999	We have never been individuals.
365100	366752	56	A	1	A work by Gilbert et al.
366806	386900	57	A	0.99948	From 2012, A Symbiotic View of Life we Have Never Been Individuals, little bit of the play on we have never been modern and the metaphors and frameworks and language that we use to talk about behavior, to talk about collective behavior, what adjectives we put in front of, what nouns, that matters.
387060	397308	58	A	1	And a great work that Ali shared with me that I think makes this point super well is by Navarro and Gabriellitis from 23.
397474	400600	59	A	1	And that work is the morphology of collective intelligence.
400680	404708	60	A	0.96764	Network swarm, multitude or assemblage.
404904	411570	61	A	0.99688	So let's head straight to Professor Gordon's 1992 work on Wittgenstein and Ant Watching.
411940	434628	62	A	0.76	And so just also for context, professor Gordon was my PhD advisor and so I was able to engage with this material and perspective through asynchronous means such as this paper, but also seeing it actually play out on a sociocultural landscape in the desert in southeast Arizona.
434804	437960	63	A	0.99987	That's where the complexity really flowered.
438380	446136	64	A	0.91	And so research in animal behavior begins by identifying what animals are doing in the course of observation.
446248	450216	65	A	1	The observer comes to see animals as performing a particular activity.
450408	452188	66	A	0.99981	How does this process work?
452354	455528	67	A	0.99996	How can we be certain that behavior is identified correctly?
455704	463808	68	A	0.9851	Wittgenstein offers an approach to these questions, looking at the uses of certainty rather than attempting to find rules that guarantee it.
463974	466588	69	A	0.99912	Here, two stages in research are distinguished.
466684	471780	70	A	0.99	First, watching animals, and second, reporting the results to other scientists.
472120	477744	71	A	0.99991	Certainty about what animals are doing has different uses at each stage.
477872	518310	72	A	1	And this is really a beautiful and subtle point by distinguishing stages of the ethological encounter, the behavioral scientific encounter, whether we're talking about ants on the ground or people in the cities, separating out the observational moment and the uncertainties that are always at play there from this secondary communication about behavior at which point having really clear defined articulations of behavior becomes so important for scientific reproducibility, integrity, accessibility and so on.
519240	535400	73	A	0.99761	Personally, I find that this paper anticipates a lot of the specifications that today we would consider part of the metabasian perspective, which is to say we're making inferences as cognitive systems about other cognitive systems.
536700	541720	74	A	0.99987	She wrote, My questions about ant watching do not arise when I'm watching ants.
542060	546524	75	A	0.99997	Most of the time, I do not think much about certainty when ant watching.
546722	550540	76	A	0.99998	Replace that for the social human setting with people watching.
550690	553564	77	A	0.99999	Sometimes we're just watching people, and that's okay.
553602	554830	78	A	0.89558	That's part of the moment.
556260	559072	79	A	1	I do not think much about certainty when ant watching.
559206	560530	80	A	1	I enact it.
562500	571540	81	A	1	The questions do not come from doubts about the certainty of my seeing, but from the ways that doubts about the certainty of seeing have shaped scientific practice.
571960	579860	82	A	1	The resolution of the problem would come from changes that would allow observers to talk about what they are actually doing when watching animals.
580540	585000	83	A	0.77392	Truthful accounts of scientific animal watching don't yet exist.
585580	590330	84	A	0.99979	This truth is not yet formed because we have not yet learned to talk about it.
592220	595928	85	A	1	What a wonderful expression and delightfully.
596024	600476	86	A	1	I came to see the confused foragers as patrollers searching for new food.
600578	607632	87	A	1	I saw the other foragers as already decided about their destination, not available to be distracted by a new source of food.
607766	615810	88	A	1	And so we have this really fascinating dialectic where in the moment we're observing in this predefinitional space.
616260	622084	89	A	0.90873	Not questioning, though maybe we went to the field site to ask and answer a question, get data about a question.
622202	635268	90	A	0.99997	But in the moment, we're in the flow of observation and not asking questions, though the uncertainty may be the highest afterwards when we're communicating to our scientific colleagues.
635364	653384	91	A	0.56	I defined an outgoing forager as a forager as a nest mate with no object in the mandibles and heading off in a straight line passing a demarcated .3 meters from the colony entrance, then people, well, why 3 meters?
653432	654360	92	A	0.99999	Why not 2 meters?
654440	657280	93	A	0.99986	Or why can't it be carrying something on the way out?
657430	662320	94	A	1	Those questions arise in that precise space of communication.
662740	670036	95	A	1	And I wanted to open the lecture with this view because it puts a space between.
670218	672870	96	A	0.56	I see that person putting out a fire.
674040	675860	97	A	0.60574	They're a firefighter.
676680	681780	98	A	1	In that space between is the interpretive moment and possibility.
681940	689610	99	A	1	And reimagining the social has so much to do with this process of, let's just say, ant watching.
691500	695336	100	A	1	Second view in this background and context section.
695528	700936	101	A	0.98	And here I wanted to draw from a wonderful presentation that JF.
700968	725620	102	A	0.17805	Cloutier, a facilitator and participant at the Active Inference institute, presented as part of his robotics and embodied project, where, yes, he's building Lego robots that do symbolic active inference, but also opening up some great philosophical directions and ones that have a lot of implications for how we think about natural, artificial and synthetic intelligence.
726200	739050	103	A	0.99998	This presentation was called All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence, and it was based upon the title and drawing upon a recent 2022 citation by Fallon Days et al.
739420	754408	104	A	1	And some of these maxims or expressions that JF provided, I thought were so provocative and also brought us back to that initial question, why collective behavior?
754584	757276	105	A	0.99	I mean, what system isn't a collective?
757308	761760	106	A	0.99863	So why do we need the adjective if we're talking about behaving systems?
762180	764316	107	A	0.99951	What is individual behavior?
764428	765184	108	A	0.9997	Individual what?
765222	766204	109	A	1	Oh, just one bird.
766252	767296	110	A	1	Oh, just one person.
767398	767952	111	A	0.76682	Okay.
768086	769330	112	A	0.99997	Made up of what?
770580	778896	113	A	1	And so JF wrote some expressions, and you can see from the link and look a little more with some images and more of what he wrote.
779008	781492	114	A	0.99818	But a few of these, I thought, were just excellent.
781636	787156	115	A	0.77788	Intelligence is a process enacted by interacting parts, not a property of individuals.
787268	789450	116	A	0.99999	Again, whatever that would even mean.
790220	791800	117	A	0.99827	Inaction is death.
792400	796860	118	A	0.99945	Being by doing action without prediction is reckless.
797840	799950	119	A	0.99996	No prediction without sense making.
800560	806130	120	A	0.75026	No sense made without a self versus the world or a self in the world.
806580	809970	121	A	1	A collective is differently intelligent than its members.
810580	816770	122	A	0.99853	Maybe trivially different, maybe better in every way, maybe another direction in every way.
818840	823328	123	A	0.99977	Why do individuals participate in collectives?
823424	826740	124	A	0.99996	Why are people in groups?
830220	847308	125	A	0.99926	Because sacrificing the autonomy to the collective provides benefit, survival, or even thrival benefits that's that I to we no making of sense without the self acting in or on the world.
847394	850584	126	A	0.99984	It's not just some essence that's disembodied.
850632	852670	127	A	0.99999	This is what embodiment is all about.
853680	857440	128	A	0.99972	An autonomous agent is a self organizing collective of parts.
857860	861250	129	A	0.94902	Parts of a collective can themselves be autonomous agents.
862020	865810	130	A	0.7795	Collectives form to improve the chance of survival of their members.
866260	870580	131	A	1	And an agent in a collective benefits from the intelligence of the collective.
871080	882612	132	A	0.89663	So to me, this presentation and line of research pursued by JF and others absolutely puts a bow on the what is an individual, what is a collective?
882756	893900	133	A	0.99999	Why do we even talk about, quote, individuals or quote collectives when we recognize the multiscale nature of complex adaptive systems.
895920	902536	134	A	1	Third Perspective a Symbiotic view of Life we have never been individuals.
902568	911276	135	A	0.99993	This is a 2012 paper by Gilbert, SAP and Tower and just to read a few aspects of what they wrote in the abstract.
911388	918740	136	A	1	The notion of the biological individual is crucial to studies of genetics, immunology, evolution, develop anatomy and physiology.
919080	930650	137	A	1	Each of these biological subdisciplines has a specific conception of individuality which has historically provided conceptual context for integrating newly acquired data.
933260	949580	138	A	0.99945	Few descriptions animals cannot be considered individuals by anatomical or physiological criteria because a diversity of symbionts are both present and functional in completing metabolic pathways and serving other physiological functions.
950240	955340	139	A	0.99966	Similarly, these new studies have shown that animal development is incomplete without symbionts.
956180	967056	140	A	0.27065	Symbionts also constitute a second mode of genetic inheritance providing selectable genetic variation for natural selection which connects it to the evolutionary concept of an individual.
967238	972816	141	A	0.99994	So if we pursue the metabolic oh, it's all the metabolic networks and how they're all connected.
972848	973636	142	A	0.56114	That's the individual.
973738	974036	143	A	0.99938	All right.
974058	976480	144	A	0.99995	Well, that includes the microbiome and symbionts.
976560	980496	145	A	0.99854	Well, no, it's the physiology and the decision making and the neurophysiology.
980608	982988	146	A	0.99999	Those are also in play with the symbionts.
983104	987512	147	A	0.77525	Well, at least evolution only selects upon the germ line, right?
987566	995976	148	A	0.99997	Well, no, actually there are these multiple mechanisms of inheritance whether they're relevant in a given situation or not is situational.
996088	1000860	149	A	0.99999	But in principle they exist and they're increasingly coming to be recognized.
1001280	1010124	150	A	0.96011	Additionally for the immune system commonly described as quote, self versus non self or self identification or self other discrimination.
1010252	1014140	151	A	0.99999	After all, we talk about autografting and allografting.
1014300	1027360	152	A	0.99999	But of course there are aspects of quote, self or self under some definitions like an epitope from a protein in cartilage that an autoimmune disorder might target.
1027440	1038504	153	A	0.99998	So the immune system is mobilized against self under some definitions sometime and is not mobilized against other under some definitions sometimes.
1038702	1044904	154	A	0.99999	Like we're not constantly mounting a massive immune response to our gut microbiome.
1044952	1070420	155	A	0.98007	Our skin microbiome, recognizing the holobiont, the multicellular Eukaryote, plus its colonies of persistent symbionts as a critically important unit of anatomy, development, physiology, immunology and evolution and cognition, opens up a new investigative avenue and conceptually challenges the ways in which the biological subdisciplines have heretofore characterized living entities.
1070760	1074336	156	A	0.99991	Here we have the COVID of the famous work Leviathan.
1074448	1079812	157	A	0.94002	It's a large person constituted of other people really making the point clear.
1079866	1087240	158	A	0.99917	But if we zoomed in on, quote, an individual person wouldn't we find something like societies of cells?
1088300	1089530	159	A	0.99999	What is an individual?
1090220	1091784	160	A	0.99997	When is an individual?
1091982	1095470	161	A	0.99991	What and what's on the line?
1096880	1099420	162	A	1	I thought those are such big questions.
1099570	1112530	163	A	0.99994	Maybe could we connect it to a little bit of more of a bibliographic piece of data just to show a snapshot and to open up this discussion to you all about what's on the line with what's an individual.
1113220	1122420	164	A	1	And so what I did is I searched for some literature trends on PubMed and here is the results per 100,000 citations for collective behavior.
1122760	1135224	165	A	0.99	And so we see collective behavior first being mentioned in the 1950s, at least in this literature database, and rising up on through around 500 or 400 or 500 per hundred thousand.
1135342	1138056	166	A	0.99996	So 1000 out of 100,000 would be 1%.
1138238	1149692	167	A	0.99996	So half of a percent of all the citations on a major biolytic literature database had collective behavior in them.
1149746	1153084	168	A	0.9983	So that's a huge amount of work, and it looks like it goes down.
1153202	1159010	169	A	0.99998	But when you actually look at how many citations there are, it's been about 4000 publications per year.
1159380	1164016	170	A	0.541	It's just that the rest of the literature database may be expanding at a faster rate.
1164118	1170304	171	A	0.99986	So thousands of papers per year and an appreciable fraction of work has to do with collective behavior.
1170432	1174132	172	A	1	And so I thought, wow, that's exciting, that's great.
1174186	1176100	173	A	0.99998	Well, how are we doing compared to behavior?
1176600	1180224	174	A	1	Now, collective behavior is this lower line in red.
1180362	1189000	175	A	1	And yeah, there's a Blip, but behavior is up between 15 and 20% of citations in PubMed.
1189340	1200380	176	A	1	Now, maybe behavior is also referring to the behavior of a given material that may or may not be a superconductor or might be using different understandings of behavior.
1202000	1209280	177	A	0.75128	But what can we say and what can we know about the difference between individual and collective behavior?
1209860	1217456	178	A	1	Now, interestingly, here I searched for individual behavior as a specific term, so we see a lot lower.
1217558	1223424	179	A	0.5317	But individual behavior, I mean, can the tide have already turned?
1223552	1228480	180	A	0.99999	Can it really be the case that after 2020, this is a real meaningful decline?
1228560	1229268	181	A	1	I don't know.
1229354	1230640	182	A	0.76454	It's too early to say.
1230730	1250152	183	A	0.99999	We can't do technical analysis just like that, but very provocative and gives us some ways to look at the broader scale or collective scientific cognitive process associated with these incredibly important philosophical and biological questions about individuality.
1250216	1257584	184	A	1	Because, of course, to distinguish collective behavior from individual behavior, or why would you even need an adjective at all?
1257702	1262290	185	A	0.99832	It's going to come down to what is an individual and what's on the line so much.
1263060	1271596	186	A	0.79	And the last view here, drawing upon the work morphology of collective intelligence network, swarm, multitude, or assemblage?
1271708	1283524	187	A	0.97	And Tony Devorrow and Alejandro Lopez Gabrielis wrote, network, swarm and multitude are some of the different metaphors that have been used to understand the concept of collective intelligence.
1283652	1287320	188	A	0.90353	All of them have reflected our relationship with the Internet and its development.
1288460	1302620	189	A	0.99977	With the advent of artificial intelligence AI, we wonder about other metaphors that might offer a new understanding of collective intelligence to address today's environmental and sociotechnical challenges.
1303840	1310716	190	A	0.99985	They bring up network, swarm and multitude to advocate for the fourth option assemblage.
1310908	1331270	191	A	0.99996	Understanding collective intelligence as an assemblage allows for the inclusion of different human and technological agents and overcomes the anthropocentrism human centrism human exclusionism of other models based on human will, whether extended as in the multitude or suppressed as in the swarm connotations here.
1331820	1339956	192	A	1	In this way, ethical decision making and responsibility are distributed among different cognitive actors with the capacity to choose and interpret.
1340148	1345080	193	A	1	And to the extent that they make decisions, albeit algorithmic ones, they are also accountable.
1345240	1355788	194	A	1	And I love this, and I think it foreshadows where we're going to be going with active inference, which is different cognitive actors have the capacity to choose and interpret.
1355884	1360576	195	A	0.99983	We might connect that to sensory and internal states of an active inference agent.
1360678	1380756	196	A	0.9987	But perception, sense making, signal processing inbound information and decision making and responsibility and accountability and the accountability that we associate with human sociotechnical systems, that's the action selection, control theory, outgoing dependencies in the Markov blanket.
1380868	1408240	197	A	0.99987	So right there, coming from outside of active inference, we see the identification of the need to have flexible frameworks, including linguistic and metaphorical, that allow us to talk about heterogeneous diverse cyberphysical systems where different entities are engaged in different practices and ways of incoming sense making and outgoing decision making.
1408390	1419076	198	A	1	And it's going to turn out that active inference is an incredible and flexible expressive framework that's going to allow us to talk about those kinds of systems pointed to here.
1419258	1420496	199	A	1	And it really matters.
1420528	1429472	200	A	0.96799	They point to some of the most important aspects of issues today on to active inference, insights and fundamentals.
1429536	1435608	201	A	0.99994	Well, here, as in all the other areas, there were so many pieces of literature that could have been drawn on.
1435774	1439480	202	A	0.99989	That's why I restricted myself to just four views.
1441580	1444972	203	A	0.99999	Also, this section is going to mark the midway point.
1445026	1458360	204	A	0.99994	We're not there yet, don't worry, but the midway point of the lecture where we move from the six declarative expressions onto the questions because it's more open than not and there's more space for you to respond than you may imagine.
1458520	1461008	205	A	0.99987	But the view is going to be here.
1461174	1463808	206	A	1	And what are the literature that support that point?
1463974	1474608	207	A	0.99971	So, first, active inference in the free energy principle, which is a principle that provides a lot of theoretical grounding and physics based perspective on active inference.
1474624	1476550	208	A	0.99999	But we're not going to go too much into it today.
1476920	1488264	209	A	0.99752	Active inference and the free energy principle are scale free formalisms for cognitive systems with collectives, as with individuals, the general framing in itself does very little.
1488462	1495336	210	A	0.99997	However, with properly constructed generative models, we can get explanation, prediction, design, influence, and implementation tools.
1495448	1508460	211	A	1	And here I'm going to draw on two pieces of work epistemic Communities under Active Inference by Mahault and colleagues in 2022 and just from several days ago, the work by Connor Hines and colleagues.
1508540	1510720	212	A	0.98955	Collective behavior from surprise minimization.
1512020	1514290	213	A	0.99761	We'll unpack the point more when we get there.
1514660	1531796	214	A	1	Second, collectives can be understood as consisting of action perception loops which subsume, entail, or supervene upon individual level action perception loops, niche modification, stigma, g can also be modeled this way.
1531978	1539448	215	A	0.59201	We'll draw upon the paper Active Inference, an active inference framework for ant colony behavior by myself and colleagues in 2021.
1539454	1544200	216	A	1	And then we'll move into the questions and things will start to open up.
1544270	1546244	217	A	0.55232	So if it feels like we've been climbing uphill.
1546292	1548392	218	A	0.58752	We're two thirds of the way with the uphill climb.
1548456	1550120	219	A	0.9996	Feels like we've been going downhill.
1550280	1560588	220	A	0.99998	We're two thirds of the way with a downhill how do the concepts of generalized synchrony and homeostasis, which are so core to active inference, relate to collective behavior?
1560764	1564176	221	A	0.65695	Here we'll discuss the work by Ralph Kaufman et al.
1564198	1568000	222	A	0.99967	From 2021, an active inference model of collective intelligence.
1568420	1580572	223	A	1	And lastly, in this section, how can active inference be used to explore the balance between individual and collective behaviors and the bi directional influence of collectives on individuals, and, of course, vice versa?
1580736	1591400	224	A	0.99997	Here we'll draw upon the computational boundary of a self developmental bioelectricity drives, multicellularity and scale free cognition by Mike Levin in 2019.
1591820	1596060	225	A	0.91327	So let's get right into the work by Mahault and Connor and colleagues.
1597520	1600396	226	A	1	First, I'm just going to bring this paper up.
1600498	1608528	227	A	0.99999	However, first you can watch more about it in Guest stream 17.1 from March 2022.
1608614	1610770	228	A	0.99971	Here's two collectives right here.
1611220	1616704	229	A	1	And also Mahault will be covering this work in a lot more detail later on in the course.
1616742	1627860	230	A	1	I just wanted to bring it up because I think it's one of the exceptional examples that can be deployed to show like, hey, just thinking about the social as an active inference system is awesome.
1627930	1629344	231	A	0.99985	It's an intuition pump.
1629472	1631904	232	A	0.99996	It brings us into the active inference ecosystem.
1631952	1633704	233	A	0.99999	But then what do we do when we're there?
1633822	1642170	234	A	1	And what we do when we're there is we develop generative models that actually take us towards where we want to be.
1643600	1649016	235	A	0.7618	Again, framing a situation as being related to active inference.
1649048	1655310	236	A	0.99999	Or you could do an active inference model of that does very, very little work by itself.
1655620	1666032	237	A	1	However, making generative models of situations, even if they're speculative generative models or qualitative or hypothetical, that can start getting towards doing work.
1666086	1670320	238	A	0.99996	But if someone said, well, that health condition, you could do a linear regression.
1670820	1673028	239	A	0.99941	Okay, but which treatment do we do?
1673114	1674992	240	A	0.99998	Well, it could be done with a linear regression.
1675056	1678388	241	A	0.92133	We could use a linear regression to figure out what method to use.
1678474	1682612	242	A	0.99785	Okay, but more or less hotter room or colder room.
1682666	1684436	243	A	0.69278	Well, just use a linear regression.
1684628	1688100	244	A	0.99967	So that's the conversation that we're having a lot with active inference.
1688260	1693652	245	A	1	A lot of times people are talking about whether a given situation can or cannot be modeled with active inference.
1693716	1698044	246	A	0.99985	Or, just in the abstract, what does active inference say about this situation?
1698242	1704828	247	A	0.99	And again, the framework itself is general to the point of doing little work, and we love it that way.
1704994	1710828	248	A	0.99964	It enables us to move into systems of interest and deploy generative models.
1710924	1723200	249	A	0.99849	So what they did in this paper was leverage the active inference framework to provide an in silicon model on the computer chip model of confirmation bias and its effect on echo chamber formation.
1723360	1732280	250	A	0.99996	They had a system of interest people's social engagement on so called social media, and they had even a phenomena of interest which was echo chamber formation.
1733020	1742040	251	A	0.99997	They built a model based on active inference where agents tend to sample information in order to justify their own view of reality, something we call self evidencing.
1742380	1749820	252	A	0.99972	We show that once agents have reached a certain level of certainty about their beliefs, it becomes very difficult to get them to change their views.
1750400	1763970	253	A	0.98	The system of self confirming beliefs is upheld and reinforced by the evolving relationship between an agent's beliefs and observations, which will, over time, will continue to provide evidence for their ingrained ideas about the world.
1764340	1771520	254	A	0.99972	Well, where I'm from, we drive on the right side of the road and so you drive on the right side of the road, I drive on the right side of the road.
1771590	1772852	255	A	0.99996	We're not going to have an issue.
1772986	1777600	256	A	0.9999	Everywhere I look, I see cars moving around, I see people passing on the right, on the sidewalk.
1777680	1778740	257	A	0.9999	It's all making sense.
1778810	1780048	258	A	0.99997	We're bounding surprise.
1780144	1781344	259	A	0.99968	We're doing active inference.
1781392	1791880	260	A	0.23263	Surprising minimization goals, reward never need to come into play to give an account of how those systems could arise and be stabilized.
1792880	1803000	261	A	0.99996	These epistemic communities are consolidated by those shared beliefs and in turn tend to produce perceptions of reality that reinforce those shared beliefs.
1803160	1814050	262	A	0.99	And on the top right is just a little teaser of what a Bayesian graphical model looks like of the kind that they deployed in this paper.
1816980	1845560	263	A	1	And here we see some of the results from their parameter sweeping, exploring different combinations of parameters and looking at topics like polarization index and reattenance rate and so all kinds of statistics that can be drawn upon, connected to the generative model and also all kinds of opportunities and interfaces to relate this to empirical data as well as suggest experiments.
1845640	1848604	264	A	0.9945	So Mahault is going to talk more about this and it's awesome work.
1848722	1868656	265	A	0.95	And then late breaking news only several days ago, five or so days ago, an amazing new pre [unk]print was put up by Connor Hines and colleagues and it was just too cool not to include here and reflects the very rapid pace of collaborative development in the active inference ecosystem.
1868768	1872260	266	A	1	And this is their work collective behavior from surprise minimization.
1872760	1877510	267	A	1	And they made every point I wanted to make here and now.
1878360	1881080	268	A	0.99981	Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature.
1881660	1889496	269	A	0.99994	Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized local interactions among constituent components e.
1889518	1893630	270	A	1	G, individual fish in a school there's that word individual again.
1894560	1907040	271	A	0.95561	Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self propelled particles, subject to self generated motion and social forces such as short range repulsion and long range attraction or alignment.
1908660	1911628	272	A	1	However, organisms are not particles.
1911804	1914320	273	A	0.99993	They are probabilistic decision makers.
1914820	1916640	274	A	0.99763	They're cognitive particles.
1917400	1921616	275	A	0.99904	We introduce an approach to modeling collective behavior based on active inference.
1921808	1928980	276	A	0.7041	This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative to minimize surprise.
1929480	1939284	277	A	0.99998	Again, if you want to, you can contrast that with reward learning, where the imperative is to maximize reward in active inference and the free energy principle.
1939412	1948220	278	A	0.75622	We're taking a path of least action not the laziest path or the most passive one, but a little bit more technically a path of least action.
1949280	1950888	279	A	1	And we're minimizing surprise.
1950984	1958060	280	A	0.99998	We're bounding surprise with variational free energy and it turns out that that helps us minimize surprise and maximize model evidence.
1958140	1962204	281	A	0.73	And it can include things like novelty and curiosity seeking very naturally.
1962252	1966450	282	A	0.9999	So this doesn't mean we're squeezing the juice out of life at all.
1967480	1984330	283	A	0.99975	We demonstrate that many empirically observed collective phenomena including cohesion milling and directed motion emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents.
1985180	1990916	284	A	0.5141	No reward, no goal, no master of the collective.
1991108	2002140	285	A	0.68755	Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations.
2002480	2014304	286	A	1	By exploring the parameter space of the beliefbased model we reveal nontrivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states.
2014502	2024820	287	A	0.99995	We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty, metacognition beliefs about beliefs determine collective decision making accuracy.
2025480	2032500	288	A	1	What if when you voted or shared your perspective on what we were going to have for dinner you also conveyed an uncertainty estimate?
2032580	2035530	289	A	0.99999	How confident are you about that being the case?
2037980	2048296	290	A	0.99999	Finally, we show how agents can update their generative model over time resulting in groups that are collectively more sensitive to external fluctuations and encode information more robustly.
2048488	2055124	291	A	1	From a distributed systems perspective you could imagine two different kinds of distributed systems or networks.
2055272	2058624	292	A	1	One of them has a dampening like quality.
2058822	2064880	293	A	0.99994	So something that enters on one side dampens as it diffuses.
2065300	2072336	294	A	1	We can also contrast that with another kind of distributed system or another kind of input or stimulus or context that amplifies.
2072528	2088216	295	A	1	And the goal or one nice property to have of systems would be like we want to dampen what we don't want to pay attention to and up signal or increase the cascading availability of what we do want to attend to.
2088318	2092040	296	A	1	Now that's a little circular since in some ways that's the definition of attention.
2092400	2109100	297	A	0.99426	However, making unified models like they do here gives us integrated approaches to explore a broad range of collective phenomena here in spatial movement but also involving the cognitive states of the particles.
2109260	2113760	298	A	1	And they make a really nice representation here to connect to other approaches.
2114260	2118956	299	A	1	A traditional approach to classical self propelled particles is agent environment.
2119068	2125060	300	A	0.99889	Agents take rules and they make decisions based upon those rules that are either given or learnt.
2126280	2131208	301	A	1	When you're this close to the bird next to you, do that and when you're this close, do this.
2131374	2141044	302	A	1	And then social forces are these kind of as if or actual constraints that then modify the agent's perspective.
2141172	2149420	303	A	0.99	And what we see in the active inference setting is that the agent and the environment are mediated by an interface.
2149920	2151368	304	A	0.64	The Markov blanket.
2151464	2151884	305	A	0.99989	This is.
2151922	2153192	306	A	1	The sensorium.
2153336	2158960	307	A	0.9997	This is on the inbound side perception and on the outbound side action.
2159940	2161436	308	A	1	And they give some more details.
2161468	2173190	309	A	0.99995	It's a really exciting paper and it's just cool to see again that even in the preparatory days of a lecture like this, there's always new collective activity in the ecosystem and that's what makes it fun.
2177080	2181000	310	A	0.62698	Last of the declarative sections of this lecture.
2181420	2196568	311	A	0.9997	Colonies here, but more generally collectives, can be understood as consisting of action perception loops which subsume, entail or supervene upon individual level action perception loops, niche modifications or stigma.
2196584	2199470	312	A	0.56	G can also be modeled this way.
2200400	2207824	313	A	0.99999	What we did in this paper was bring something new to active inference in at least two different ways.
2208022	2213904	314	A	1	First, it was the first model of an ant system of interest.
2214022	2220580	315	A	1	Now, for some of us mere mycologists in the audience, all of our broader entomology colleagues, that may be enough.
2220730	2231532	316	A	0.99997	But what was also really interesting about this work and the opportunity to collaborate on it, was it was the first active inference model presented with explicit stigmaji.
2231616	2247020	317	A	1	Not just the philosophical consideration of the traces that agents leaving in the environment might then have them change their behavior in the future, but explicitly engaging with this process of multiagent stigmurgic behavior.
2248880	2253992	318	A	0.99883	Active inference may be informative in the study of ant colonies at three distinct temporal scales.
2254136	2265036	319	A	0.99898	Nest mate behavior, which is to say emergent among tissues of a nest mate, you could keep on going collectively down and interactions with the biotic or abiotic environment.
2265148	2279328	320	A	0.99998	So, first level at the level of a nest mate, one of those things with six legs that looks like an insect, at the level of the colony, colony development is emergent among nest mates and their interactions with the niche.
2279504	2283360	321	A	0.99998	That is where many people would traditionally assign collective behavior.
2283440	2289396	322	A	0.65811	They say, well, one nest mate walking around is individual behavior, that's the individual ants.
2289508	2293240	323	A	1	And then the colony is where collective behavior comes into play, right?
2293310	2296284	324	A	1	And we're going to see that reified very soon.
2296482	2303340	325	A	0.99999	But lastly, we point to the evolution of populations, which is an emergent outcome amongst colonies within an ecology.
2303760	2316400	326	A	0.99999	In this work, we focused on the connection between the first two levels of analysis, focusing on the case of stigmergic colony foraging using a modification of previous active inference computational implementations.
2317060	2322084	327	A	0.99654	We didn't use the word individual and there's a reason why.
2322282	2338964	328	A	0.99975	Because we're saying what we mean more clearly when talking about ants, when we talk about nest mates, colonies and populations of colonies that sidesteps or transcends the discussion of what is an individual and what is a collective.
2339012	2347464	329	A	0.99999	Because with respect to the colony as an individual, if you want to use that word, the population is a collective with respect to the nest mate, the colony is a collective.
2347592	2354184	330	A	0.99997	With respect to the tissue like the brain or the mid gut, the nest mate is a collective.
2354312	2357264	331	A	0.99981	So we don't need to play the adjective game.
2357382	2364400	332	A	0.99999	We can just articulate what we're interested in about these systems of interest and complex adaptive system phenomena.
2364900	2376900	333	A	1	And so what we did was we explored a kind of classical behavioral setting which is food being placed between the arms of a teammates and in this case, rather than a rat.
2379400	2388010	334	A	0.54212	I'm just pausing for a second while I believe that my internet is reconnecting and we should be back.
2389820	2397352	335	A	0.99998	Each ant was described by an action perception loop, an active inference action perception loop.
2397496	2405496	336	A	1	And they were able to move within a three by three grid as well as perceive pheromone density within a three by three grid.
2405608	2413484	337	A	1	And then they laid down pheromone, they added stigmaergic trace on the way home if they had found a seed.
2413612	2419716	338	A	1	And so this does a few interesting things and livestream 29 is where we unpack this a lot more.
2419738	2422036	339	A	1	But I just wanted to make two more points here.
2422138	2434132	340	A	0.71	The first is that in a reward centric perspective on ant behavior, the pheromone is seen as a semiotic queue and the seed or the food is seen as the reward.
2434276	2439432	341	A	1	And so then we got to use the cues, we got to use the pheromone density to figure out where the good stuff is.
2439486	2441080	342	A	0.78762	That's that paradigm.
2441820	2444264	343	A	0.99999	We flipped that with active inference.
2444392	2458000	344	A	1	Now, the preference we don't need to say reward, but the preference, that which is sought after proximally but teleologically, that which is sought after preferred over is the pheromone.
2458900	2466208	345	A	1	The seed becomes the semiotic cue that it's time to turn on your pheromone depositing and come home.
2466374	2484410	346	A	0.74	And so that flips our approach to understanding what foraging is about from we're lost in the sauce, trying to figure out where the good thing is out there to we're surfing the 100 foot wave and we'll know it when we see it, and then we'll turn around.
2485260	2486436	347	A	0.99998	Very different perspective.
2486468	2495660	348	A	1	And then one other point that I had to make for the context was that we used a modification of a previous active inference computational implementation.
2496000	2500510	349	A	0.99909	What was the paper that we drew from?
2501120	2509480	350	A	0.99978	In fact, it was the acquisition of culturally patterned attention styles under active inference with Axel and Alex et al.
2509650	2529220	351	A	0.99	And what this paper did was they looked at the situation of visual foraging on a vase, a piece of pottery, where the eye was only able to perceive a three by three matrix of pixels.
2529640	2537268	352	A	1	And then the eye scanned around looking to recognize broader patterns that were then culturally acquired.
2537444	2548860	353	A	0.99997	So maybe one culture or one subculture likes the checkerboard pattern and another one likes vertical lines, another one likes horizontal lines or these other kinds of repetitive structures.
2550320	2559680	354	A	0.80334	What's so interesting is that the eye, when it is foraging, does not leave a trace, though it can feel like it, doesn't it?
2559830	2566450	355	A	0.70152	But the eye forges around in order to get the bigger picture based on local information.
2567380	2572340	356	A	0.99999	What we did is we said, well, instead of imagining that as the gaze location of an eye.
2572680	2579056	357	A	0.68315	Let's imagine that as the skin in the game exoskeleton on the ground of a forager.
2579248	2596508	358	A	0.99993	So let's think about that movement as something that an embodied forager does with its real body and then conditional in this setting upon it touching the seed or the food, it can lay down a pheromone trail, which the eyes can't do per se.
2596674	2604056	359	A	0.68	And so just really interesting because it's not like this was an ant paper and now we're going to try to cram it into social sciences.
2604168	2613250	360	A	0.99996	It's actually like computational work in the social sciences was able to translate to Mirmacology into ants research.
2613780	2620150	361	A	1	And so it's a very fruitful and bi directional relationship between studying ants and studying people.
2622200	2627700	362	A	0.76	Now we're going to move into the openness of questions in this second half of the lecture.
2628120	2635348	363	A	0.9996	So how do the concepts of generalized synchrony and homeostasis, which are core to active inference, relate to collective behavior?
2635524	2645144	364	A	1	And here we can draw upon the work by Ralph Kaufman, Pranav Gupta and Jacob Taylor from 2021 called inactive inference model of collective intelligence.
2645192	2648236	365	A	0.87	And this was also unpacked in Gestream Nine.
2648418	2650652	366	A	1	And so here's a little collective over here.
2650786	2666640	367	A	1	And that was about two years ago, way back when what they did in this paper was they considered a setting with two trolley cars moving around a wheel.
2667800	2670276	368	A	1	And so here's how they contextualize that work.
2670458	2685172	369	A	0.69136	Formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local scale interactions between autonomous subsystem components individuals and global scale behavior of the composite system, the collective.
2685316	2691080	370	A	0.99507	So they do a really great job staking out what they mean by individual and collective.
2691740	2709600	371	A	0.99995	In this paper, we use the active inference formulation AIF, a framework for explaining the behavior of any non equilibrium steady state system at any scale deposit, a minimal agent based model that simulates the relationship between local individual level interaction and collective intelligence.
2710340	2719776	372	A	0.99997	Then they had a really creative approach to disentangling how different capacities translated to different collective outcomes.
2719808	2720950	373	A	1	And here's what they did.
2721720	2726516	374	A	0.99999	We explore the effects of providing baseline active inference agents.
2726698	2743556	375	A	0.99976	Model one with specific cognitive capabilities, model two added in a theory of mind, model three added in goal alignment, and model four added both theory of mind and goal alignment.
2743748	2745204	376	A	0.99998	What does that look like?
2745342	2750044	377	A	0.99999	Again, we're not going to go into all the technical details here, but broadly, this is what it looked like.
2750162	2754430	378	A	0.99999	Here was their simplest baseline active inference formulation case.
2754980	2764080	379	A	1	And then in the subsequent experiments, they added in either one or the other or both of the cognitive capacities that they described.
2765140	2778870	380	A	0.99989	They studied the single DIAD case and they very cleverly expanded that into a large scale multidiad case.
2780040	2792408	381	A	0.99717	They utilized their own representation of the octave inference partition in order to facilitate the construction of this model.
2792574	2797452	382	A	0.99	And so in this case, we see the blanket with the sensory states coming in, the active states going out.
2797586	2799020	383	A	0.98402	Markov blanket.
2800800	2806370	384	A	0.99989	Here we see the environment and then internal belief states or cognitive states.
2807460	2819670	385	A	0.99913	So very cool work that helps us get a vocabulary around, not shut the book on, but focus on.
2820440	2824656	386	A	0.9355	How do different agents come to synchronize?
2824848	2826624	387	A	1	What is generalized synchrony?
2826672	2845656	388	A	0.99989	Well, it doesn't mean Lockstep turntaking is generalized synchrony, because these two agents, the time that they're talking, has very high mutual information on the other, even though the correlation with their speaking might be negative, agent A is speaking when B is not, and vice versa.
2845768	2850328	389	A	0.9998	So from a linear regression perspective, there's a negative correlation.
2850504	2859840	390	A	0.99995	But from a mutual information perspective, where you can't ever have below zero information, at worst it's just noise.
2860740	2867992	391	A	0.99997	You always have zero or positive amount of information of systems about other systems.
2868156	2878240	392	A	1	And so that opens the door to understanding generalized synchrony, which is a broader conception of how individuals and collectives are interacting.
2878400	2879536	393	A	0.76	And homeostasis.
2879568	2886964	394	A	0.99998	Maybe we could even imagine that these are multiple cells in the pancreas and they're trying to coordinate on insulin sensitivity.
2887092	2895176	395	A	0.99636	Or maybe this is multiple people who are securing the defense of a community and they also need to coordinate synchronously and asynchronously.
2895288	2907804	396	A	1	And so there's a lot of ways in which this very, very lightweight apparatus of the active inference partition helps us bring together and compose all these cool.
2907842	2908316	397	A	0.99998	What ifs?
2908348	2910480	398	A	0.99716	Well, what if it had theory of mind?
2910630	2912332	399	A	1	What if it had goal alignment?
2912476	2915600	400	A	0.99999	What if agents had theory of mind and goal alignment?
2916020	2925780	401	A	0.99993	What if we put them in a five x seven grid and then we did this and and that's what we get to do with active inference.
2926120	2937700	402	A	0.65	And lastly here, how can active inference be used to explore the balance between individual and collective behavioral and the bi directional influence of collectives on individuals?
2937860	2952696	403	A	1	And so here I draw upon the amazing and singular work of Professor Mike Levin, who wrote the computational boundary of a self developmental bioelectricity drives multicellularity and scale free cognition in 2019.
2952808	2956620	404	A	0.99999	This was also explored in Livestream 25 series.
2957060	2974500	405	A	0.99968	So, just to pull out a few of the great pieces of this article, and there's a stigmaic trail of many other papers for those who follow, professor Levin writes, I propose a definition of an individual based on its information processing structure.
2975240	2982890	406	A	1	The scale and types of goals that a system can pursue, defines or determines the boundaries and the content of the putative agent.
2984220	2994510	407	A	1	On this view, what defines a coherent, unified self out of its constituents, components and the surrounding environment is the set of parts that operate towards reaching specific goal states.
2995040	3012770	408	A	0.91997	So this is a teleological or a functional or anticipatory or sentient or adaptive or informational concept on individuals, which we can add to the earlier consideration raised by Gilbert et al.
3013140	3021860	409	A	0.9994	Here they discuss some of the more mechanistic biological considerations like genetics, immunology, evolution, development, anatomy, and physiology.
3023320	3032116	410	A	0.99936	What Levin has done here, and consistent with this, is the informational theory of individuality by David Krakauer et al.
3032298	3036612	411	A	0.99837	Is connect this more generally to system capacity.
3036756	3051500	412	A	0.99	And so there is what is here represented as like a time diamond, where the scope or the scale of the system in the now is like the radius or the circumference on this diamond.
3051920	3060210	413	A	1	And then the part of the diamond that recedes off into the past, that's retained from the past, is memory and history.
3060900	3070260	414	A	0.53	And the part that advances or pretends into the future is the anticipatory or the planning capacity.
3070680	3083652	415	A	0.91709	This opens the door to describing diverse intelligences, including possible alien artificial intelligence or synthetic intelligences, as well as nested or compound intelligences.
3083796	3087364	416	A	0.99993	So here the example is the ant colony.
3087492	3104440	417	A	0.99992	So here we have cells, these little pinkish diamonds nested within a nest mate, which is the green diamond nested within the colony, which is the blue diamond.
3104600	3108160	418	A	1	Now, notice that the nest mate is called an organism.
3108900	3117052	419	A	1	I couldn't help but to connect this to Wheeler 1911, whose work is the Ant Colony as an organism.
3117196	3119108	420	A	0.59187	Superorganism came later.
3119274	3132752	421	A	1	The superorganismal framing on the ant colony reifies the concept that the nest mate is the individual or the organism, because why else would you need to call the colony a superorganism?
3132816	3134584	422	A	1	I mean, I think colonies are super.
3134702	3138504	423	A	1	I think it's great to call them whatever you want to call them, and they probably don't mind either.
3138622	3145864	424	A	0.99987	But the idea that a superorganism is composed of other organisms means that the nest mate is an organism.
3145912	3161920	425	A	0.99592	Whereas this diagram, in my perspective, would be as accurate or more to say nest mate here, because under different concepts of organismality, which is to say individuality, if we want to connect it there, the colony can be considered as the organism.
3164980	3187652	426	A	0.99	And of the so many other pieces of this work that are fun to bring out, the way that Levin clarifies his assumptions gives us, first off, some planks that we can jump off of for good and helps us come to terms with maybe like, what do we assume about behavior, about collective behavior?
3187796	3193860	427	A	0.9993	How do we want to show up when we're studying collective behavior in general and when we're studying social behavior?
3193940	3197500	428	A	0.99992	After all, we're in active inference for the social sciences.
3198160	3203900	429	A	0.97	And so Levin writes, the ideas are explored here from the perspective of the following three core assumptions.
3205040	3206876	430	A	1	First is a commitment to evolution.
3206988	3210640	431	A	0.99999	Every capacity has a natural history and emerged from simpler variants.
3211300	3217040	432	A	1	Second, it is assumed that all metaphors are to be judged by their utility in driving scientific progress.
3217480	3226820	433	A	0.99986	There is not a binary categorization of scientific pictures which should be taken literally or not, which can be decided a priori upfront.
3227640	3232368	434	A	1	Third, much of the discussion centers around goals related to teleology.
3232464	3248316	435	A	1	A hotly debated topic here, goal directedness is taken in the nonmagical cybernetic engineering and control theory sense of a feedback system that operates to maximize some specific state of affairs, which can be modeled as a dynamical system with attractors in its state space.
3248418	3256620	436	A	1	And later work by Levin and Fields and others expanded this concept of intelligence just to phenomenal heights and flavors.
3256780	3279300	437	A	0.99724	So active inference helps us understand that cognitive glue maybe it's mechanistically enacted by bioelectricity in a given system or at a given scale, but active inference gives us the analytical glue to approach those systems with an open mind and an open scaffold.
3279720	3287492	438	A	1	And so those are some of the insights and fundamentals of active inference as applied to collective behavioral systems.
3287636	3299340	439	A	1	Now on to the last third of this lecture applications and Implications of Active Inference for the Social Sciences regarding collective behavior.
3300480	3304510	440	A	0.99999	This is really where it is wide, wide, wide open.
3306820	3315068	441	A	0.99834	What kinds of insights can active inference offer about the role of learning, adaptation, conflict, and cooperation in collective behavior?
3315164	3318720	442	A	1	And how can we approach that from a cognitive security perspective?
3319080	3332680	443	A	0.99989	Here we'll draw on the work of Scott David and colleagues, active Inference in Modeling Conflict what implications does active inference have on the study of human collective behavior, particularly in social, economic, and digital contexts?
3333100	3336650	444	A	0.99999	Here we'll draw on the work by Poirier et al.
3337020	3340068	445	A	0.46907	Communication as socially extended active inference.

3360444	3363712	449	A	0.7692	Here we'll turn to the work of Friston et al.
3363766	3364288	450	A	0.91	Et al.
3364374	3375184	451	A	0.88	2022, designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles and how does active inference accommodate collective behavior within and across generations?
3375312	3381216	452	A	0.98	And here we'll look at a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics by Friston et al.
3381258	3382730	453	A	0.99999	In 2023.
3383100	3393548	454	A	0.99956	So when it comes to applications and implications of active inference in social sittings and settings, again, there's so much to do, there's so much to learn.
3393634	3396120	455	A	0.98945	So we welcome everybody who's curious.
3396200	3405952	456	A	0.99996	This is the time to write your live chats, submit your questions, prepare yourself to explore, and to be an active forager in this space.
3406006	3408530	457	A	1	And if you're listening, you know that you already are.
3409140	3410112	458	A	0.99753	So in the work.
3410166	3412636	459	A	0.94149	Active inference in modeling conflict.
3412828	3413276	460	A	0.99982	Scott.
3413308	3414476	461	A	0.99955	David RJ.
3414508	3424656	462	A	0.96604	Corday and myself asked what kinds of insights can active inference offer about the role of learning, adaptation, conflict and cooperation in collective behavior?
3424768	3428470	463	A	0.98	Now, as with all these other papers, there's always so many things that can be said.
3429400	3438360	464	A	0.99996	What we did is we tried to connect beyond the very classical Markov blanket and agent environment partitioning, which we've seen many, many times.
3438510	3445304	465	A	0.99978	We tried to connect this to the specific kind of generative models that we use in modeling.
3445432	3452504	466	A	0.99577	So here we led early by clarifying, this is what we're talking about with active inference, generative models.
3452632	3457532	467	A	0.99966	It's not like something I'm hiding in my pocket and maybe I'll show you if you say the shibolith.
3457676	3463868	468	A	0.99999	This is what we're talking about when we're talking about applying active inference models to social settings.
3463964	3467600	469	A	0.95381	It's a discrete time generative model here just a motif.
3469400	3481968	470	A	0.9964	We applied that kind of generative model architecture to one of the most well known models of sense making and decision making, which is the UDA loop.
3482064	3488340	471	A	0.93027	Observe, orient, decide, act by John Boyd Now this may seem to some like a quite sparse framework.
3488420	3492600	472	A	0.99571	Like, yeah, you get the observation, you figure it out, you make a decision, you take the action.
3493500	3496200	473	A	0.99912	It doesn't do that much work by itself either.
3496270	3500524	474	A	0.99766	However, UDA is used in tactical and strategic settings every single day.
3500642	3507916	475	A	0.99	And so we wanted to connect OODA loop to the generative models that we use in active inference.
3507948	3513724	476	A	1	And so we highlighted on the generative model where different stages of the OODA loop occur.
3513852	3516032	477	A	0.99579	Perception happens in the sensory states.
3516166	3524036	478	A	0.5017	Cognition or the orientation happens in the perceptual inference, the downstairs of that part of the figure.
3524218	3530004	479	A	1	And then decision making happens in the upstairs with the expected free energy calculation in this case.
3530122	3536952	480	A	1	And finally action is selected and enacted and that results in impact and the cycle begins again.
3537086	3543660	481	A	1	Now, in active inference it's more like an unfolding flow, but to a first pass approximation it does the trick.
3544160	3548860	482	A	0.74592	Why does that really matter that we understand the mechanics of decision making?
3549010	3553020	483	A	0.99998	Well, we're talking about active inference in the social setting.
3553440	3568710	484	A	1	That means we're talking about two sophisticated cognitive entities, maybe two businesses, maybe two individual humans, maybe a person and a business, maybe different kinds of systems that we don't even know about or we haven't even seen yet.
3569880	3580180	485	A	0.99	And that generative model is the internal states that is then participating in this minimal dyadic collective behavioral encounter.
3580860	3589400	486	A	0.99883	We can expand that to thinking about commons resource, commons attention, commons open source ecosystems.
3589740	3601070	487	A	0.99	And for this we utilized one of Scott David's favorite acronyms of which he has so so many, which is Bolts business, Operation, Legal, Technical and Social.
3601920	3606430	488	A	0.839	Bolts is not an exhaustive acronym, otherwise we would need everything.
3606800	3612508	489	A	0.99937	But it's a heuristic that encourages us to think holistically about different systems.
3612604	3620048	490	A	0.99643	Let's just say that we were a business or a person and we wanted to see if a given policy was a good way to go to complete our mission.
3620224	3625264	491	A	1	And it looks good, except it can't be done operationally.
3625392	3631120	492	A	0.99943	Well then that has to be taken into account or everything works out but it's illegal.
3631280	3633256	493	A	0.39271	That's not the way to go.
3633438	3635496	494	A	0.99986	Everything works out, but the business doesn't check out.
3635518	3639784	495	A	0.89688	It's not going to be sustainable financially or technically it can't be done.
3639822	3641720	496	A	0.99997	Or socially it's not palatable.
3642140	3654236	497	A	0.99981	All of these features of sociotechnical systems, which again we just make a little mnemonic of with Bolts need to be taken into account for comprehensive and high integrity, high reliability systems design.
3654418	3660716	498	A	0.99998	In this setting we have entity A and entity B interacting through the Bolts niche.
3660828	3663708	499	A	0.99306	They each have their own blanket states sense in action.
3663884	3670124	500	A	1	And the niche where those nest mates were laying their pheromones, the niche is bolts.
3670252	3677990	501	A	0.99	And so you could make a restricted model where it's just two entities engaged in a financial dealing, just a business only engaging on B.
3678360	3684280	502	A	0.99999	Or you could think of this multidomain full spectrum situation in terms of bolts.
3684620	3689400	503	A	0.69073	Then you would have a larger and a more complex interface between these two entities.
3689740	3696584	504	A	0.99977	But we also wanted to think about the case where there might be cooperation between these entities or there might be conflict.
3696712	3698684	505	A	0.93	And so here we have entity A and B.
3698722	3701180	506	A	1	The Dyad is in the spotlight.
3701760	3710412	507	A	0.95822	Entity C is a non belligerent state or it's a bystander, or it's a witness, or it's a referee, or it's a friend, or it's a colleague.
3710476	3717596	508	A	0.99547	But entity C is also engaging only through their blanket states on bolts.
3717788	3726148	509	A	1	And lastly, we connect it to the Abiotic niche which may not care how much you're buying or selling a gallon of oil for.
3726314	3728352	510	A	1	The abiotic niche may have its own dynamics.
3728416	3732056	511	A	0.99999	We may use active inference to model that or we might use some other approach to model it.
3732158	3742436	512	A	1	And so this sets a really, really general state space for us to understand conflict and cooperation and where we situated that work.
3742558	3752476	513	A	0.99974	Lastly, here was in relationship to other work exploring strategic and tactical decision making and so on.
3752498	3758240	514	A	1	The lower end of this image are tactical and operational frameworks that are used in decision making.
3758390	3764140	515	A	1	On the top are strategic or scholarly frameworks that are used for more of like geopolitical considerations.
3764300	3771776	516	A	1	And then from left to right we have more qualitative approaches going to more formal and quantitative approaches.
3771888	3787416	517	A	1	And we believe that the application of active inference through this type of model, the active inference conflict model, helps us touch the qualitative natural language and graphical composable aspects and the quantitative and formal aspects as well.
3787518	3802990	518	A	0.99	And similarly, through nested decision making cycles we can talk about tactical operational activities and the broader nested strategy just like we looked at the nested cones from Professor Levin's work.
3804880	3814076	519	A	0.98267	Next, what implications does active inference have on the study of human collective behavior, particularly in social, economic and digital contexts?
3814188	3825408	520	A	0.99972	Well, there's a lot to say about this, but Tisson and Pore wrote in 2021 the paper communication as socially extended active inference, an ecological approach to communicative behavior.
3825504	3828224	521	A	0.98	And this was in the Livestream 48 series.
3828352	3834330	522	A	0.86949	Here's Remy raising his hand so that we knew that he wanted to speak.
3835740	3849580	523	A	0.99999	They introduced an ecological account of communication according to which acts of communication are active inference achieved by affecting the behavior of a target organism via the modification of its field of affordances.
3850880	3864940	524	A	0.99988	Constraining a target organism's behavior constitutes a mechanism of socially extended active inference allowing organisms to proactively regulate their interstates through the behavior of other organisms.
3865100	3882520	525	A	0.90806	In this general conception of communication, the type of cooperative communication characteristic of human communicative interaction is a way of constraining interaction dynamics towards the goals of a given joint action by constructing and altering shared fields of affordances.
3883020	3897630	526	A	1	This account embraces a pragmatist view, according to which communication is a form of action aiming to influence the behavior of a target and stands against the traditional transmission view, according to which communication fundamentally serves to convey information.
3898480	3916220	527	A	0.99981	Understanding acts of communication as active inference under an ecological interpretation allows us to link communicative and ultimately linguistic behavior to the biological imperative of minimizing free energy and to emphasize the action oriented nature of communicative interaction.
3916380	3929632	528	A	0.59898	This is really a rich and excellent work that Remy and Pierre produced, and there are several pieces that I think add a lot of meaning and value to the ways that we think about communication.
3929776	3932920	529	A	0.99533	But most broadly, what is communication for?
3933070	3934792	530	A	0.60764	Who do we talk to and why?
3934926	3937130	531	A	0.78858	What do we like to talk about and why?
3937580	3939112	532	A	0.78459	Why would anyone say that?
3939166	3940090	533	A	0.55	And why?
3941260	3953688	534	A	0.99996	How does technique, considered broadly, technology and technique, whether it's digital or social or cultural technique, mediate and influence communication?
3953864	3955260	535	A	1	The media is the message.
3955410	3956944	536	A	1	The medium is the message.
3957142	3959344	537	A	1	And think about everything in that area, too.
3959462	3973872	538	A	1	And how can active inference, beyond just giving these incredible composable formal tools, how can we think about joint action and co modification of fields of affordances?
3973936	3976880	539	A	0.95775	Hey, could you pick that up from that shelf?
3977040	3978676	540	A	0.95891	Okay, I'll open it for you.
3978778	3981624	541	A	1	Now let's hand it to our friend who's going to make the food.
3981822	3991720	542	A	0.99998	All of these ways in which individuals shape each other's field of affordances is something that we can talk about really fluidly within active inference.
3994400	4005400	543	A	0.99761	Penultimate View what considerations are relevant for thinking about assemblages and interactions among different entities in cognitive ecosystems?
4005560	4011120	544	A	0.9998	So here was a large multi author paper from Karl Friston et al.
4011190	4016608	545	A	1	And The Versus Colleagues designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles from December 2022.
4016614	4031956	546	A	0.98	And the big picture as I see it here is what is the role of the social sciences after all the course that we're in now in ecosystems of diverse heterogeneous?
4032068	4033668	547	A	0.91758	Synthetic intelligences.
4033844	4040900	548	A	0.80292	By synthetic intelligences, I refer to assemblages with intelligence, whether it's natural or artificial.
4041060	4048888	549	A	0.99982	Leave that debate for another day, because in their application, we're talking about synthetic intelligence.
4048984	4051260	550	A	0.99691	Synthetic intelligence needs cognitive security.
4051410	4054460	551	A	0.82395	Cognitive security needs cognitive science.
4055120	4063692	552	A	1	And they began this paper with the following this white paper presents active inference as an approach to research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.
4063756	4070900	553	A	0.92	AI artificial with the aim of developing ecosystems of natural and artificial intelligences.
4071800	4093000	554	A	1	The path forward in AI is often presented as progressing from systems that are able to solve problems within one narrow domain, artificial narrow intelligence ANI to systems that are able to solve problems in a domain general manner at or beyond human levels, what are known as artificial general intelligence, AGI, and artificial superintelligence ASI.
4094000	4104056	555	A	0.99994	We believe that approaching ASI or for reasons outlined below, even AGI likely requires an understanding of networked or collective intelligence.
4104248	4107980	556	A	0.95	Now, intelligence in action is behavior.
4108140	4119536	557	A	0.99998	So we're talking about collective behavior and they laid out their timeline and the stages that they see in terms of sentient, sophisticated, sympathetic and finally shared intelligences.
4119728	4124710	558	A	0.99999	But I think it's worth to dwell a moment on the one figure of this paper.
4125320	4129520	559	A	0.99953	Figure one belief updating on a statistical manifold.
4129680	4137160	560	A	1	And so here we have some curve in an information geometric space, it's a parameter space of a probability distribution.
4137740	4167040	561	A	1	And on this manifold, on this line on a plane, lower dimensional manifold projection, there's a temporal process belief at time t, T plus one, T plus two, where initially this gaussian that's very distributed becomes updated to a sharper peak distribution that's going to be resting basically at some special point on this curve.
4168440	4179964	562	A	0.99997	Whether you're very familiar with accelerated optimization on information geometric manifolds or not, it's really interesting to consider why they went with this image.
4180112	4200220	563	A	1	And for those again who are familiar or just coming to be familiar with some of the formalisms of active inference, this is what this very talented and transdisciplinary team went with when seeking to provide some of the only nontextual descriptions of their work.
4200370	4211136	564	A	0.99781	So I think it's really interesting and the big question is, well, what is the social reassembling the social Bruno La Tour, what is the social?
4211238	4212290	565	A	0.99988	What is social?
4213220	4217936	566	A	0.99981	Does social mean only adult humans talking with each other?
4218118	4221996	567	A	0.99994	Does social include non human species?
4222188	4226820	568	A	0.97229	Does social include non biological intelligences?
4227160	4231400	569	A	0.99998	These are all things that are not just questions of theory.
4231740	4246516	570	A	0.97889	So connecting flexible extensible frameworks like active inference and all that comes along with it to this bigger question about applications and implications of applied active inference in the social setting.
4246628	4255020	571	A	0.98683	That's what I hope we can explore in the questions at the end of this live stream and in the discussions that we have in a couple of weeks and ongoing.
4255860	4262412	572	A	0.98	And lastly, how does active inference accommodate collective behavioral within and across generations?
4262556	4271590	573	A	0.99	And so here I'll draw on the recent work a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics with Karl Friston, myself and others.
4272280	4278660	574	A	0.98	And we had two images in this work which otherwise had a lot of prose and formalism.
4279160	4303656	575	A	1	On the left, we see that active inference, particular partition, external states, internal states, blanket states, here at the organismal level, one worm, and in an enested deeper system, the population, which gives rise to the starting positionality of the organisms.
4303768	4324880	576	A	0.99995	Think about drawing an organism from a gene pool, from a birth pool and the impact that those organisms have on the bigger picture, maybe it's a bacteria that is fermenting so it changes the PH or the ethanol concentration of the Kombucha.
4325040	4339080	577	A	0.99936	That is this kind of multiscale interaction that we believe provides an approach to understanding ecoevo devo, ecology, evolution and developmental interactions.
4339420	4344288	578	A	0.97	And the other visualization that we use here is of nested systems.
4344324	4352140	579	A	0.96865	So contrast that with the kind of time diamond that we saw from Mike Levin.
4352560	4357824	580	A	1	Now here, imagine that we're going to cut across the.
4357862	4373940	581	A	0.99956	Center of this diamond and now it's going to look like a muscle fiber fibers of fibers, because we have, let's just say this outer blue line may be the colony.
4374920	4383384	582	A	1	And then each of these smaller entities is an estimate and they're composed of cells, and cells have constituents too.
4383582	4394856	583	A	0.52	And here we utilized the apparatus of the renormalization group which draws upon physics to articulate the separation of scales.
4395048	4406220	584	A	0.99996	So that we can be clear when are we talking about multiscale systems which we can articulate and renormalize across vertically to use an encultured metaphor?
4406380	4413404	585	A	0.72	And then within a given scale of analysis, what is the lateral or collective behavior?
4413532	4420052	586	A	0.99992	So how do we get those interactions amongst nest mates that are both constrained by the colony top down?
4420186	4427536	587	A	0.9999	Again, using a spatial and encultured metaphor top down scaffolded or enabled or constrained by the colony.
4427568	4432228	588	A	0.99981	But then what nest mates do matters and that influences the colony.
4432404	4441124	589	A	0.99	And we used a few new pieces of formalism primarily developed by Coral to help express that setting.
4441172	4450920	590	A	1	And again, we think it's going to be really useful for describing otherwise quite challenging scenarios in ecology, evolution and development.
4451080	4455808	591	A	1	And so we come right back to that what is a self?
4455894	4457920	592	A	0.99999	What about nested selves?
4459460	4462610	593	A	1	And with that, I turn to some open questions.
4463780	4470710	594	A	0.99999	What can be said other than there are so many open questions to discuss?
4471480	4479540	595	A	0.65683	There's many things we can explore in the discussion that I'll be facilitating in a couple of weeks.
4479610	4490250	596	A	1	And of course, beyond we have a coda interface for you to submit questions that all the course teachers will take a look at and give their best attempt on.
4490620	4494456	597	A	0.95	And conversation is collective behavior.
4494568	4501404	598	A	1	Now, sure, keeping it inside of your head is also collective behavior, no matter how you think about it.
4501522	4508816	599	A	0.99987	But when we enact in the social, then we're really making it happen.
4508998	4515840	600	A	0.9998	So with that, I will just show my citations and the slides will be shared too.
4515910	4521412	601	A	0.99995	Also, there's some extra readings that various individuals along the way suggested to me.
4521546	4527510	602	A	0.99998	So that includes social ecologies and abductive logic enacting like a state.
4527960	4528992	603	A	1	These are not the titles.
4529056	4530576	604	A	1	The titles are inactive.
4530608	4532716	605	A	0.91994	Dynamic Social Cognition and Active Inference.
4532768	4538276	606	A	0.99994	That was livestream 47 thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds.
4538308	4547736	607	A	0.99997	That Was Livestream 33 Active Inference applicability to different kinds of social Organizations explained through reference to industrial engineering and quality Management.
4547768	4554620	608	A	0.99989	That was live stream 27 resonating minds emergent collaboration through hierarchical active inference.
4556160	4563836	609	A	0.73118	Yellow Broomberg's and Eric Wrightvel's work on self organization, free energy minimization and optimal grip on a field of affordances.
4563948	4569020	610	A	0.99	And the well known Thinking through Other Minds work by Vesier et al.
4569110	4570304	611	A	0.98755	Thinking through other minds.
4570352	4572980	612	A	0.96	A variational approach to cognition and culture.
4574920	4582090	613	A	0.99695	Well, I hope this has been an interesting and relevant lecture for you.
4583100	4584900	614	A	0.85669	It was fun to prepare.
4585060	4594516	615	A	0.99962	There are so many perspectives and so much territory that there's a lot in collective behavior.
4594628	4599880	616	A	0.99998	But again, I'm just really looking forward to the discussion that we can have in a couple of weeks.
4599950	4618080	617	A	1	I encourage you, whether you're listening on your timeline and at a moment that enables you to join that live conversation, I would encourage you to join or to join the live stream so you can participate through chat or whether you want to find some other way to get involved.
4619380	4623250	618	A	0.99916	It's been a great time, and with that, I will close.
4623620	4624544	619	A	0.99996	Thank you very much.
4624582	4625810	620	A	0.98568	Until next time.
4626820	4627180	621	A	0.54894	Bye.
