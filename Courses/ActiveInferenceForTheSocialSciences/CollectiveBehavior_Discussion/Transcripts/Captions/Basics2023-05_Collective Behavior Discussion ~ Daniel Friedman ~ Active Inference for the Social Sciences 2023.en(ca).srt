1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,532
Hello and welcome. It's August 16,

3
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:14,680
2023. We're in the collective behavior

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,876
discussion section of the active

5
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:20,488
inference for the Social sciences course

6
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:24,424
in 2023. So perhaps let us

7
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:28,216
all go around and give an

8
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:31,424
opening in introduction and or

9
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:35,024
reflection and see who

10
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:37,824
joins and what happens from there. But

11
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:40,530
just so that everybody has said hello.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,532
Hi, everyone. I'm Brun 09:00

13
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,232
P.m. In South Africa, and, yeah,

14
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:58,490
just excited to be and see what happens.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,728
Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a graduate student

16
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:11,280
in Indiana,

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,948
and I guess my field

18
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,184
of interest now is knowledge management.

19
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:22,532
And I think that figuring out how we

20
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:27,752
collectively learn and can share

21
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:29,688
information is a really interesting

22
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:31,816
topic, and I'd like to see how this

23
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:32,890
would apply.

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,086
Hi, I'm Gina, and I'm from Guatemala,

25
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,274
but I'm living in Spain, studying and

26
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,766
doing experiments related to this topic

27
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,140
and trying to learn a little bit of the

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,302
theory that's behind it so we can

29
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:56,910
advance better. I'm excited.

30
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,054
Hello. My name is Sasha. I'm calling in

31
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:05,386
from California. I'm also a graduate

32
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:09,474
student. Yeah, just really enjoyed the

33
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:12,562
spirited presentation last week.

34
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,450
I'm looking forward to a discussion.

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,086
All right, well, how about anyone

36
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:24,418
can give a first reflection

37
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,790
on collective behavior?

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,810
What was their thought or context

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,034
before, and where are they at as we kind

40
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,370
of begin? Yeah, Regina.

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,418
Okay, so I just want to make sure that I

42
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,800
understand because I took, like, two big

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,718
lessons from your lesson, right?

44
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:55,774
And the first one is that this

45
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,714
famous model of active inference that

46
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:01,902
has the agent and the environment

47
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:05,090
and the Markov blanket in the middle,

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,394
right? And just interacts with

49
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:09,774
everything. Right. So I think what I got

50
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:13,186
from what you discuss, maybe I didn't

51
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,814
have a good definition of an agent, but

52
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,694
first, that you can have that agent not

53
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,570
be just an individual, but also your

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,020
definition of an individual changes

55
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,618
depending on what you want to study in

56
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:32,314
the behavior. Right. So an agent can be

57
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,182
an ant, it can be an ecosystem,

58
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:39,054
it can be an eye looking at something,

59
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,174
or it can be as a society, for example.

60
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,654
And I think that's a big take for me

61
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,814
because it changes a lot the concept of

62
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,914
how to study things and use active

63
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,026
imprints just by changing how big the

64
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:56,274
agent can be. So I don't know if I got

65
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:59,042
that right. So first, that

66
00:03:59,096 --> 00:03:59,890
clarification.

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,970
So what is an agent?

68
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,576
Yeah, so I don't know if there's, like,

69
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,624
a formal definition of an agent in

70
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:18,844
active inference. Right. But if

71
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,070
we want to study whatever we want,

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,388
because I'm about study, because I have

73
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:26,220
to do that's, like, my goal, whatever

74
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm doing. So I want to study whatever

75
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,096
I have to choose what's going to be my

76
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:35,264
agent and the environment it has. So

77
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:38,224
choosing the agent, you can do it to

78
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,528
create a model or to make an experiment,

79
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:44,244
whatever. But the

80
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:49,156
choice you make, it will depend on what

81
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,496
you understand as an individual or as an

82
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:54,010
agent? I think so. Right.

83
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,020
Awesome. Anyone have a thought on that?

84
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,666
If I continue with something, just to

85
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,750
add something else, and this will be my

86
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,934
mind. And then I'm thinking,

87
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:19,662
is that also a big

88
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,890
problem that we have or I think I have,

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,290
is that since I am part

90
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,810
of the environment,

91
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,314
you know, the perspective of whoever is

92
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:33,586
studying whatever it is, it's also going

93
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:37,350
to be an effect in it. So maybe

94
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,446
scientists already decided, but I don't

95
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:42,370
know that we can never have an objective

96
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,698
way of studying something if you're

97
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,720
part of the environment of the agent.

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,522
So, I don't know, we already forgot it

99
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,874
or we already decided that's it we

100
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:54,874
cannot have objective observations of

101
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:57,882
behavior in general. But you always

102
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:01,274
think about the agent environment and

103
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:03,870
you studying it as something else, but

104
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,398
something else is also affecting it. So

105
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,702
I see that as a problem or maybe

106
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:10,766
something that has to be said, like we

107
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,186
are not objective because we're part of

108
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,794
what it's affecting our agents in the

109
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:19,538
behavior collectively too. So those are

110
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,540
the thoughts I have to share.

111
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,846
Regina, I'm also new to all of this. So

112
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,886
my preliminary understanding of what is

113
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:34,406
an agent is anything that has

114
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:38,462
any good reason to self evidence

115
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:42,490
and to itself or to survive

116
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,514
that doesn't want to dissipate, that

117
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,946
might delineate the boundary of what an

118
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:54,846
agent is. That then sets up the

119
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:58,320
boundaries with which it will,

120
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,238
as you describe, start interacting with

121
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:04,830
the world, with the environment. So if

122
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,594
something, as I understand it, if

123
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:08,994
something has a reason to go on being to

124
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:09,890
survive,

125
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,600
then it is an agent in the world.

126
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,398
Okay, but that agent could be anything,

127
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,534
right? Is that what you're saying?

128
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,306
Right? Like, if he wants to survive,

129
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:29,434
can be an ant surviving individually or

130
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:33,366
a cell or a a good that's

131
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:34,810
like a good definition.

132
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,582
Okay. Yeah.

133
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:45,118
Sasha. Great points.

134
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:49,374
Regina, so much to say. There something

135
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:52,174
that I have experience with as a

136
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,514
researcher in biology is deciding the

137
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:58,578
kind of the statistics or

138
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:01,438
sampling approach to use, whether we're

139
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:05,154
taking one cell from one individual

140
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:08,422
or we're taking many cells from many

141
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:10,406
individuals, and how to do the

142
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:13,554
statistics and kind of sampling approach

143
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:17,382
on that. That is an evergreen question

144
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:19,820
that we're always reevaluating to see

145
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,062
how to think about the independencies

146
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:25,210
within biological systems.

147
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,354
And then another thing that you

148
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:33,662
mentioned was about the individual being

149
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,286
part of the ecosystem. And that makes me

150
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,814
think a lot about complexity science and

151
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,950
something that is addressed there in

152
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,110
thinking about the interplay of the

153
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,650
scientists and what they're studying.

154
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,780
Yeah, thank you for those points.

155
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,676
Sasha. Can sorry, I'm not raising my

156
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:05,956
hand, I'm just unmuting it. That's okay.

157
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,396
Can you say a bit more about what you

158
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,460
mean by complexity science?

159
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,324
Maybe muted? Oh, can't speak

160
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:27,190
at the moment.

161
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,372
Yeah. Complexity science has looked

162
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:37,364
at agent based modeling as a fundamental

163
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,896
tool. John Holland signals and

164
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:43,976
boundaries, focusing on what from an

165
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:45,736
active inference side, we might say, as

166
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,308
like message passing or communication

167
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:51,176
for the messages and then boundaries

168
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:54,670
with the whole discussion around

169
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,856
the boundaries in the world. Map

170
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,040
territory, map territory fallacy.

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Map territory fallacy. Fallacy.

172
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,996
Doing iterative modeling. Sasha brought

173
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:11,488
up limited experimental resources in

174
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,696
the scientific setting, and that's kind

175
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:16,308
of analogous to the limited energy

176
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:19,120
budget or attentional budget ultimately,

177
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,004
or just decision making budget of the

178
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:28,176
kinds of active entities that make

179
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:29,752
sense to model the ones that kind of

180
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:32,040
have those characteristics.

181
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,072
This is really the question of what

182
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:38,216
makes something first principles or what

183
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,384
are the first principles? One aspect

184
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,688
of it, as brought up is the censoring

185
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,380
of the persistence. So from the outside,

186
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,604
that's kind of like an empiricist's view

187
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:52,560
of persistence, like, is it measurable?

188
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,250
But not saying that something is

189
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,616
necessarily that which is the

190
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:59,696
statistical tool, and then the sort of

191
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:03,570
like inside out implementation type.

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,820
But there's a lot more to say in that.

193
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,724
Who wants to bring in some new

194
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:16,636
angle or how do they see collective

195
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:19,016
behavior? Why do we talk about

196
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:22,456
collective behavior? Why not just

197
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,504
behavior, recognize that behavior is

198
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,730
multiscale or is social,

199
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,164
what's really being communicated with

200
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,380
the collective?

201
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,794
I believe that we chose those levels so

202
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,506
we can make it more simple for our

203
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,530
brains to understand it. Because if we

204
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,430
talk about collective behavior,

205
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,634
actually is the universe behaving and

206
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:00,580
the particles and everything, right?

207
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,574
So I don't know if that's a little bit

208
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:06,534
just based on I don't know what's the

209
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,886
word, like, just the material world and

210
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,574
how it physically moves and that's like

211
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:16,874
deterministic or whatever, right? But I

212
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:19,802
think us, we chose to have those

213
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,626
limitations so we could understand the

214
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:23,686
world, but also we should acknowledge

215
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,806
that our limited because we're part of

216
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,640
the system.

217
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,006
I'm having a little trouble on my kind

218
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:35,520
of understanding, I guess, where the

219
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,066
schism lies between kind of the

220
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:43,422
Markov blanket and the umwelt

221
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:47,246
in semiotics of the animals

222
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:48,820
sensory experience.

223
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,856
Anyone have maybe someone could Daniel,

224
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:06,444
do you know the difference between that

225
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,804
two? Can you be a little louder?

226
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,968
Thank you, though. Andrew? Anyone have a

227
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,896
thought on that? I'll bring in a

228
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,744
definition of then and then we can see.

229
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:19,970
But meanwhile, does anyone have a.

230
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,704
Sorry. Sorry, I was just muted on zoom.

231
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:28,224
Andrew, you're a little quiet, but I'm

232
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:30,560
going to bring in a definition of umvelt

233
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,696
and then meanwhile, does anyone have a

234
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:33,290
thought?

235
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,876
I hope I'm not further

236
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:53,770
diluting Andrew's question,

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,452
but I think of collective behavior in

238
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,944
kind of like, I don't know, a football

239
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:05,020
team or a soccer team and what that

240
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:09,552
provides the

241
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:13,916
group who shares

242
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:16,512
some common ethos and what that does to

243
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:20,624
the how that regulates their collective

244
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,164
or individual and collective free

245
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,508
energies during a match or

246
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:28,230
throughout the season, and how that

247
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,592
gives some

248
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:39,636
charge to some investment.

249
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:43,080
Because it's my team against yours,

250
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,876
and we have to try and win.

251
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:50,664
And so without that collective

252
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:51,500
behavior,

253
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,144
it might be far harder to achieve a

254
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:00,624
group's goals if they aren't able to

255
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:04,924
collaborate and share implicitly

256
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,172
and explicitly certain traits,

257
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,224
behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals,

258
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,596
ideologies, whatever they might be, and

259
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:16,240
how that then allows us to compete

260
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,270
in the world.

261
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,480
I see what you're saying. It's brain.

262
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,310
Yes, okay. I see what you're saying.

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,708
Especially because we're watching the

264
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:34,300
World Cup, right? Women's World Cup.

265
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,024
Yeah. So it's very relevant. But I see

266
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:43,120
that in all the things you've said,

267
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,984
it seems that for you, behavior needs to

268
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:49,764
have like a goal. And I don't know if

269
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:52,096
I agree with that. It's either survival

270
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,508
or winning. But maybe for me,

271
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,524
it's just something that happens and

272
00:15:57,642 --> 00:16:00,504
maybe the consequence is surviving, but

273
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,384
it's not the goal to survive or to win

274
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,504
the game. I mean, in the football it is,

275
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,730
right? But in general,

276
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,516
maybe there's no goal to the behavior

277
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:13,720
collectively,

278
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,150
just the thoughts. It's interesting.

279
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,964
Yeah, a lot of great comments. Well,

280
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:27,324
the paper of Connor Hines

281
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,424
at all on the collective behavior as

282
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:32,576
surprise minimization that points the

283
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:36,236
way towards using the act infontology

284
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,404
these kinds of modeling approaches for

285
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:41,204
collective behavioral situations and

286
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:42,756
really just recognizing them as a

287
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:45,616
certain type of behavioral modeling.

288
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:49,270
The simplest case might just be a single

289
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,210
closed system,

290
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,440
all part of the composition

291
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,884
that leads to the ability to describe

292
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:03,668
at very least a lot of different kinds

293
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,596
of systems, just like a linear model can

294
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:08,168
describe a lot of systems. So then it's

295
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:11,004
also really interesting a topic that

296
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,352
came up in one of the recent textbook

297
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,120
groups with what's normative about

298
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,370
active inference, because the term of

299
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,948
the process theory, even of active

300
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:27,684
inference being normative is mentioned

301
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:29,636
multiple times. And that's definitely a

302
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:32,820
topic that connects to the social

303
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,876
sciences. One can imagine the kind of

304
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:40,340
niche normativity or niche regularities

305
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,088
in a broad sense and then the

306
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:47,144
real minute particulars of how they play

307
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,680
out, which kind of hints at the kind of

308
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,620
descriptive or causal minimum

309
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,700
to start making some anything but toy

310
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,580
specific generative models.

311
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,616
So it's been an interesting theme to

312
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:11,436
see, even already in Abel's

313
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,440
and Ben's lectures and discussions

314
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,380
this question between description

315
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,396
process of describing which is what

316
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,896
I associated with Professor Gordon's

317
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,312
approach to ant watching how that

318
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:35,704
descriptive process which is what we can

319
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:38,260
say that we have for active inference,

320
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,124
just like a linear modeling ecosystem

321
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,116
could say about their linear modeling in

322
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:46,830
principle, and how to then

323
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,076
articulate the normativities of the

324
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,692
framework, if that concept,

325
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:59,472
if that separation can even exist from

326
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:04,080
the behavioral normativities

327
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,420
that include the basis of social

328
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,648
fabric in all different kinds

329
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:12,660
of communities.

330
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,246
Here's another question. So what is

331
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:03,960
the role of any technical detail

332
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,586
in the social sciences, whether more on

333
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:14,170
the statistical connecting with data or

334
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,010
more category theoretic, like just

335
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,314
formal? What's the role of formal

336
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:26,462
methods in different

337
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,750
kinds of academic or practical

338
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,790
expressions about social systems.

339
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,006
Does it matter at all how

340
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:44,720
we think about a framework at all?

341
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,126
Well, for formalizing aspects

342
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:54,546
of a social system, I would say that the

343
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:58,786
purpose is for communication between

344
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:04,390
individuals because just we

345
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,558
can't verify that. Well,

346
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:10,406
formalizing it is just setting a system

347
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:12,790
on top of what you're observing.

348
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,610
But there is no explicit

349
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,206
guarantee what you're saying encompasses

350
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,646
everything of the phenomena you're

351
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:24,700
observing. And.

352
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,994
Just. Kind of

353
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,294
going back to Taoism of the

354
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,150
name that can be named is not the true

355
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,482
eternal name. And so it's just a way

356
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:44,706
of it's a slice of

357
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:52,034
what we can observe. And maybe

358
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:53,538
you can make predictions or maybe you

359
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,900
can generate something that acts like

360
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,370
the phenomena you're observing.

361
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:09,078
It's a way to kind of it's

362
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,674
just a way to kind of approximate our

363
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,986
understanding of some phenomena. And you

364
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,714
have to slice it in a specific way, but

365
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,950
also understanding that it is a slice or

366
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,426
it is a tangent line that you're

367
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,146
approximating as opposed to encompassing

368
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:26,794
the whole system from verbalizing

369
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:27,440
it.

370
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,282
I will add maybe it's not the goal but

371
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:40,014
something that happens out of describing

372
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:43,300
any system. Like Andrew said, it's like

373
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,142
the goal to modify it or

374
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:52,114
to corrupt it in some way to gain

375
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,214
control or whatever. If you know the

376
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:56,726
model, you know how to play the game,

377
00:22:56,828 --> 00:23:00,882
kind of. So you write instructions

378
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,214
and try to see if you can outsmart

379
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:06,650
someone else. I mean, it sounds kind of

380
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,338
dark, right? But maybe it's one of the

381
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,066
goals too, or something that just

382
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:12,986
happens out of knowing the rules that

383
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,570
nobody else knows.

384
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,580
I guess when you talk about control,

385
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,610
there is a shade that can be gained

386
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,886
from that specific wording. But control

387
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:34,214
in terms of control theory or that comes

388
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:35,846
from electrical engineering and it's

389
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:39,814
really just what

390
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,786
shapes the behavior or what are the

391
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:44,826
inputs that drive the behavior. And when

392
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,966
you're talking about control, it's

393
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:49,114
really just about well, if you change

394
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:51,146
these inputs, how does that change the

395
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,280
end behavior? And so you can actually

396
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,670
from electrical engineering of control

397
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,154
in some sort of electromechanical

398
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,614
system, but then you can make analogous

399
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:08,094
statements on control into society

400
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:11,054
which doesn't necessarily mean the dark

401
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:13,346
negative control, but maybe there's some

402
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:17,320
pathological behavior in a society or

403
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:24,754
even pathological pathological

404
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,338
responses within the brain and it's

405
00:24:26,354 --> 00:24:28,886
like, well, what is driving that? And is

406
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:33,274
it possible to change

407
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:34,794
the drivers of that to have something

408
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:38,374
that is more beneficial

409
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,340
to the system?

410
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,568
Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's

411
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:54,244
saying, because it matters how

412
00:24:54,282 --> 00:25:00,424
you manipulate a

413
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:03,480
system or it matters how you affect a

414
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,744
brain. So it cannot be random. I mean,

415
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:09,288
we've come a long way, for example,

416
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,224
from lobotomy, which had disastrous

417
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:16,988
effects. And it matters to

418
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:19,884
a system how you affect it. And so to

419
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:24,268
know more formally the most effective

420
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:27,040
way to create a desired effect,

421
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,172
whatever that might be it's essential

422
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:31,856
that it's not just kind of poking and

423
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:39,556
prodding that is as

424
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:41,552
much as that is part of the scientific

425
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:45,392
method to update that method

426
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,110
in accordance with what you're learning

427
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,470
is important.

428
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,926
No, I think you're both right. It

429
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:58,358
doesn't have to be dark. But also

430
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:01,094
something else that Andrew said about

431
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,410
predicting. I think that's one of also

432
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,022
the big goals trying to predict

433
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:14,906
whether to be prepared it

434
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:17,406
couldn't be to control right, but if you

435
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:20,314
can somehow predict how people respond

436
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,966
to this or how a system will behave in

437
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:27,678
this other scenario you can change

438
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:31,666
what the input is or prepare for

439
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:33,220
whatever comes, I guess.

440
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,474
Yeah, a lot of great points.

441
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:44,742
Some of the commonly held not equally

442
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:48,202
by everyone, everyone, but some of the

443
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,258
tenets of science being to explain

444
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:55,082
predict design and control where

445
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:58,546
explanation and fiction are on

446
00:26:58,568 --> 00:27:01,406
the pathway towards systems designing

447
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:03,906
and maintenance and other words that

448
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:06,830
people can add. But that's the pragmatic

449
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,226
utility oriented view which doesn't

450
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:12,166
have to be an absolutist view but

451
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:13,762
certainly there are regimes of attention

452
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:16,582
socially now and seemingly for long long

453
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,200
times where people were wanting to

454
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,294
retain and to constrain the variance

455
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,914
distribution on what we would say

456
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:31,226
is their generative model. Some norm and

457
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,274
then other times engaging in these

458
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:36,234
functions. And that instrumentalist

459
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:38,586
usage of active inference is like we're

460
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:42,206
going to be able to model it with a

461
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,754
pretty minimum framework that's

462
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:48,650
commonly used in statistical systems

463
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,626
where some things we observe and some we

464
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:53,426
don't, and at least we know and how all

465
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:56,210
the pieces are connected. And then that

466
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,790
is an artifact in model based design as

467
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,486
people develop

468
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:07,350
that line through time socially,

469
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,134
just like probably has been always the

470
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:13,862
case for complex projects and scientific

471
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,130
collaboration.

472
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,366
There's a few other interesting pieces

473
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,874
but yeah, please. I'm just

474
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,414
wondering if now that I'm thinking out

475
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:30,446
loud, isn't that like a problem for

476
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:34,094
confirmation bias? Right? Like there's a

477
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:36,382
paper in here. Here because we create

478
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:38,066
the knowledge and we tell everyone the

479
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:40,226
knowledge this is the model, this is how

480
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:43,774
everything behaves and then we update

481
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:46,322
our knowledge about it and then we look

482
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:50,200
for everything to just confirm it.

483
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,390
Maybe there's other system that will not

484
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,922
let us be getting knowledge so slowly

485
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:01,606
because if everybody just agrees on

486
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:03,698
something we teach it to everyone and we

487
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:06,026
confirm the model and then we just try

488
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:08,186
to look for evidence for that model then

489
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:11,242
we go slowly if there's any better thing

490
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,580
or better model that comes along.

491
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,544
Yeah, a lot to say about that. Like if

492
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:22,124
we believe that trees exist or that

493
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,804
people exist and then we come to see

494
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,212
them. So there's kind of this sense

495
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:27,068
where problem confirmation bias which I

496
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:29,344
think is a great term, a great topic to

497
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:32,268
bring in with definitely also what's

498
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:35,056
called like the golden nail syndrome or

499
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:37,564
something. If all you have is the hammer

500
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:40,876
then everything is a nail and there's

501
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,496
definitely attention there because it's

502
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,716
like how much of what you can do are you

503
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:48,496
supposed to do something that you can't

504
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:52,116
do, but then at least you could do what

505
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:53,648
you needed to do to get there. So that's

506
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:54,888
actually within your scope of what you

507
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,456
can do. So it's not that there are

508
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,004
things that you can't do that you can't

509
00:29:58,052 --> 00:30:00,852
do if just from a measurement

510
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:05,236
perspective. So how

511
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,464
does it look? Or how do we recognize

512
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:11,068
across systems or how do we have

513
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:13,800
awareness in situations as limited

514
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,870
individuals who do have all of these

515
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,792
cognitive phenomena, how to make

516
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:23,904
decisions or sense making or

517
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:26,000
infrastructure or whatever it is the

518
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,600
socialness the system of interest

519
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,884
of the social sciences make that and

520
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:35,590
then dot, dot, dot normatively what?

521
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,704
I think there's some protection built

522
00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:46,440
into the problem

523
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,792
of confirmation bias because all

524
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,384
knowledge generation is happening in an

525
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:55,016
open system. And so there's always going

526
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,156
to be an agent outside of your

527
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:02,092
own mind and what it's perceiving that

528
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:05,470
can then challenge or add to

529
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,010
the super, the LK 99

530
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,448
semiconductors that has been all the

531
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:20,152
rage recently and how other scientists

532
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:24,436
have now kind of discredited it

533
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:26,756
quite convincingly. And it's because of

534
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:29,476
this open they might have had degrees of

535
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:32,016
confirmation bias that they were egging

536
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:34,104
each other on, but it's ultimately been

537
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,672
refuted, which is this built

538
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:40,264
in kind of protection because it's all

539
00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:43,320
operating in an open system.

540
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,440
Fortunately.

541
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,148
Yeah, a lot to say there. Monday Morning

542
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:55,924
Reviewer twoing how how do we again go

543
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:59,784
from any given description of a

544
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:03,416
communicative event like the kind of

545
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:06,680
specific unfolding of the LK 99

546
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,440
narrative, as yet uncompleted

547
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,164
in the minds of some, which is real

548
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:15,580
enough to be real socially?

549
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,128
So how do we go from any descriptive

550
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:23,692
anything about that total observation to

551
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:27,570
core screening then

552
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,432
how do we come to work

553
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:34,832
with that interface, with whatever that

554
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,850
is hands that to us?

555
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,206
What is the social behavior? What are

556
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:53,062
some classic or some

557
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:56,790
novel social behavioral,

558
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,838
maybe ones that seem pretty obvious due

559
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,410
to recency bias?

560
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,706
I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew

561
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:24,366
and I have also talked about is the

562
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:28,590
autopoietic nature of information

563
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,030
systems. Andrew, do you have any

564
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,182
thought on this or about where

565
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:38,340
autopoiesis comes into,

566
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,666
like, social sciences or these kinds of

567
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:42,530
models?

568
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,790
Daniel andrew just left a note that he's

569
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,294
back. He just wasn't looking at the

570
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:55,078
time. Funny stuff. Anyone else have a

571
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:56,040
thought on that?

572
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,722
Okay, just just to kind of carry forward

573
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:06,490
then. Basically the ability of social

574
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,026
systems that include written niche

575
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:12,350
modification, cumulative culture,

576
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:17,242
their increasing extent

577
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:20,538
of control as discussed earlier,

578
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:22,590
that definitely is a bit of an

579
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,166
overloaded or at. Least doubly meant

580
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:27,826
term in different settings because it

581
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,474
can just simply mean modeling it with

582
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:31,314
control theory, which is a pretty

583
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,694
limited philosophical statement relative

584
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:36,006
to any statistical method or control.

585
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,586
Like the kind that people are unhappy

586
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,406
with and the kind that's described in

587
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:44,806
Thinking Like a State. And a lot of

588
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:47,174
other works that I know Mahault and

589
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,834
Lorena and Abel are going to be

590
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:53,820
definitely going into more detail

591
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:59,802
on. So when societies can model and

592
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:04,750
introspect or self reflect formally

593
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,040
much better,

594
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,826
and that can happen through anything

595
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:20,382
from free and open source federated

596
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:24,210
protocols, there's many limited formats

597
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,954
of self meaning making, but cryptography

598
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,874
definitely allows those explorations,

599
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,526
and that doesn't necessarily mean

600
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,254
computer cryptography. That could also

601
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:36,086
be like linguistic encoding and all

602
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:39,802
these other ways of niche sub

603
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:43,610
differentiation in multiscale systems.

604
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,882
You just do not see a system that

605
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:50,170
is cookie cutter.

606
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,066
It's very rare in ecosystems.

607
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,294
There are algal blooms and things like

608
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,494
that. So when we really

609
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:03,646
think about the developmental and the

610
00:36:03,668 --> 00:36:06,050
cognitive and the selective niche,

611
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,934
which is a concept that Axel Constant

612
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:12,018
and others have differentiated in some

613
00:36:12,024 --> 00:36:14,610
of their ecological active inference,

614
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,202
like, that niche is very embodied,

615
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:22,018
extended. And cultured, et cetera, et

616
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,598
cetera. It's just like a kind of cool,

617
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:27,974
direct way to open up to that

618
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:31,340
challenge of modeling and just

619
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:38,090
bring some closures

620
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,954
with different accounts or

621
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:43,390
compatibilities with different accounts.

622
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,934
Just to give one random example. But

623
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,102
maybe it'd be interesting what what

624
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:53,306
other people think. All the expressions

625
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:57,234
that people make in social settings can

626
00:36:57,272 --> 00:36:59,074
just simply be their expressions or

627
00:36:59,112 --> 00:37:04,914
modeled as such. That is in

628
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:08,742
one way implicitly what was always

629
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:15,506
in play, but now it's

630
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:18,530
describable and legible and autonomous.

631
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,694
So how do we take this active inference,

632
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,714
collective behavior crossover and

633
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:30,554
think about what it really means in how

634
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:32,162
we're going to be thinking differently,

635
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:35,358
even just this discussion forward or

636
00:37:35,524 --> 00:37:39,150
more locally, our understandings with

637
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,950
collective behavior or with behavior?

638
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,224
Daniel, can you ask the question again?

639
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:21,992
I didn't actually catch the question.

640
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:25,768
How do we start to adapt some of these

641
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:29,756
general comments or

642
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:32,188
frames that are in some ways

643
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:34,892
disconnected from descriptions of real

644
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:39,724
systems? How do we think about that and

645
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:42,350
what it means now?

646
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,330
Sorry, go ahead. That's okay.

647
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,384
Do you mean on the document in front of

648
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:55,856
us? These disconnected things in front

649
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,340
of us, they're on the document.

650
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,196
I don't know, whatever you think or

651
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:03,430
whatever you want to say.

652
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,390
Okay,

653
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,242
yeah, I again,

654
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:20,946
I hope I'm not fully

655
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:22,258
understanding the question. I hope I'm

656
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:26,166
not steering away too much, but I had

657
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:28,182
a general sense of what I think you were

658
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:32,166
saying, and I

659
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:34,666
think it's an enormous problem with the

660
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:38,810
amount of information sharing.

661
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,860
Just let's just take the

662
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,702
generative models of social

663
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:51,646
media and all of the platforms that are

664
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:55,534
available to us, how much information we

665
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:59,140
are privy to in any given moment.

666
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,810
And I'm kind of forgetting

667
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,806
the question that you asked, but how

668
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:13,206
do you it's almost as

669
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:16,534
if there is such a high rate

670
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:19,346
of information and data flow that it's

671
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,526
really hard to know what to do with all

672
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:25,306
of it. At least as a

673
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:26,314
human being. I'm not saying for

674
00:40:26,352 --> 00:40:30,106
machines, but as

675
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,658
a psychologist. I'm certainly interested

676
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,886
in how humans are able

677
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:44,142
to tolerate and respond to the

678
00:40:44,196 --> 00:40:48,186
amount and rate of information that's

679
00:40:48,218 --> 00:40:49,200
out there.

680
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,044
This is not the first time this happens,

681
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,612
right? Like we went from talking to

682
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,776
writing information, then everyone wrote

683
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:13,860
their information and then we have books

684
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,948
and then we have libraries and that's

685
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,736
all available. And again, we have

686
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:22,824
access, if you can read right, to all

687
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:25,244
the information in the world. So we

688
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,572
adapted to, I don't know,

689
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:32,476
to get careers so we could specify in

690
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:34,476
which type of information you are going

691
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:37,744
to know more. So maybe we need some sort

692
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:40,752
of new career type, I don't know, more

693
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:43,890
specification with more information.

694
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,130
But is the rate of information

695
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,284
flow and increase? Is it not

696
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:54,708
exponential? I don't

697
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,464
know. It's a crazy amount and our brains

698
00:41:56,512 --> 00:41:59,156
cannot do anything about it. So we have

699
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:01,544
to do multidisciplinary things and work

700
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,352
together with others if we want to make

701
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:07,592
something. But yeah,

702
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:09,384
I don't know, maybe we will die of

703
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:10,570
excess of information.

704
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,372
How do people feel like active inference

705
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:48,836
brings something to the discussion

706
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:52,392
relative to how they want to

707
00:42:52,446 --> 00:43:05,384
work towards ants?

708
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:08,008
Yeah, well, isn't that the provocative

709
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:11,388
question too? But like any system,

710
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:13,296
that's the question. Everyone is going

711
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:16,192
to have their own memes and themes and

712
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:18,736
systems that they have spent time with

713
00:43:18,758 --> 00:43:20,496
and did field work with and all this

714
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:23,712
other particularity because a system

715
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,812
that doesn't have particularity is just

716
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:29,056
not going to be hosting a broad

717
00:43:29,088 --> 00:43:32,660
enough niche for phenotypic diversity.

718
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,756
It's just riding on the edge of a razor

719
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:40,328
instead of more like a fabric that

720
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:48,766
continues to unfold. I think there's

721
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:50,854
a lot of work to do with the social

722
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:52,774
sciences and active inference just from

723
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:56,342
what I was reading, trying to find

724
00:43:56,396 --> 00:44:00,790
things for this discussion

725
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,682
and just I personally wondered what is

726
00:44:04,736 --> 00:44:08,950
meaningful or interesting or useful,

727
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,802
what's epistemic and pragmatic value for

728
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:15,162
different audiences? How does it go from

729
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:18,622
kind of bringing citations that were not

730
00:44:18,676 --> 00:44:22,960
linked together in

731
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,714
some more theoretical or more generative

732
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:29,330
model oriented work in active inference

733
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,882
like epistemic foraging or

734
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:37,154
the infra ants model or any

735
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:39,186
other kind of specific model? What do

736
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,178
these different kinds of scientific

737
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:46,262
artifacts do for

738
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:46,920
who?

739
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:13,684
I guess I'm still learning very crudely

740
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:16,456
ploddling along here, Daniel, to try and

741
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,760
answer that because I've quickly

742
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,644
realized that the field is so multi

743
00:45:22,692 --> 00:45:27,164
nodal. It has so much the

744
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:31,084
free energy principle, the Bayesian

745
00:45:31,132 --> 00:45:34,220
brain, even just to psychology,

746
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,224
has so much applicability. And everyone

747
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:41,376
I meet at these discussions is coming at

748
00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:44,836
it from a different angle. And it can

749
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:48,692
be a bit confusing to hear how other

750
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,132
people are applying it,

751
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:55,224
how other people are making use

752
00:45:55,262 --> 00:45:58,760
of it in all manner of ways.

753
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,090
And so I'm still learning how to apply

754
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,560
to kind of ring fence, the free energy

755
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,190
principle and connect it to

756
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,144
psychological processes including

757
00:46:11,272 --> 00:46:13,596
collective behavior because there's a

758
00:46:13,618 --> 00:46:16,716
lot of psychopathology in group think in

759
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:20,224
collective behavior, but I'm also very

760
00:46:20,262 --> 00:46:22,448
interested in its application at the

761
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:26,450
interface of what happens between

762
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,232
a therapist and a patient. I'm often,

763
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:34,640
unlike other professions,

764
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,472
who are just by nature of the scientific

765
00:46:39,536 --> 00:46:43,364
method, are able to extract a lot

766
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:46,820
more data to work with, to analyze,

767
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,690
to,

768
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,392
you know, in a in a that's very hard

769
00:46:54,446 --> 00:46:57,084
to do. I feel very limited other than

770
00:46:57,122 --> 00:46:58,824
just making kind of theoretical leaps

771
00:46:58,872 --> 00:47:03,116
and inferences about how to apply the

772
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:05,180
free energy principle to psychology.

773
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,812
I can't have a session with my brain

774
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:14,240
hooked up to an fMRI machine to get data

775
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,728
and to see when a patient says

776
00:47:17,894 --> 00:47:21,356
boo or bar, that's a spike on the spike

777
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:24,648
trains, which represents surprisal,

778
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,516
and we can then solve for that in some

779
00:47:26,538 --> 00:47:28,916
way. I don't have access to that sort of

780
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:32,416
data flow, so it feels limited, but I'm

781
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:37,224
still learning how to apply it and

782
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:39,610
trying to collaborate with colleagues on

783
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,370
the influence group.

784
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,628
What are people wondering about

785
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,348
collective behavior, even if we're

786
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:02,560
totally, of course, not going to address

787
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,304
it, but just what are the kinds of

788
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:09,536
things that people what

789
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:12,080
makes you look up collective behavior

790
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,204
instead of just behavior or individual

791
00:48:15,322 --> 00:48:26,848
behavioral?

792
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:29,976
For me, it's about safety and need to

793
00:48:29,998 --> 00:48:30,760
belong.

794
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,370
For me,

795
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,164
I think that it depends where you come

796
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:46,172
from and the country you are,

797
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,652
but there are places that are more

798
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:50,588
collective, and there are places that

799
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,876
are more individualistic. And I think

800
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:55,776
mostly non Western countries have a lot

801
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:58,688
of collective behavior and knowledge and

802
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:01,776
spirits already. Right. That they

803
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:04,704
already knew these things that we think

804
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:07,270
are new for us. Right. How the

805
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,916
collective thing works, for example, I

806
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:12,432
don't know. You don't make a decision

807
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:14,836
for yourself. You make a decision for

808
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:16,912
the group. Like marrying. You marry

809
00:49:16,976 --> 00:49:19,736
because you want an addition. You want

810
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:22,680
to interact with someone or other group.

811
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,704
And that's something that affects the

812
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:28,004
collective, not just you. So arranged

813
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:30,216
marriage makes sense. Something like

814
00:49:30,238 --> 00:49:32,924
that. Right. So for me, making that

815
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:35,064
distinction about individual collective

816
00:49:35,112 --> 00:49:37,848
comes from understanding that, I don't

817
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:39,404
know, there are other places that are

818
00:49:39,522 --> 00:49:42,140
already ahead in what collective means

819
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,224
in terms of human beings and how to

820
00:49:44,262 --> 00:49:47,616
interact. And the Western world, we have

821
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:49,920
all this individualistic thing, which is

822
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,392
very interesting because why do we have

823
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:56,452
the same species? And then we have very

824
00:49:56,506 --> 00:49:58,164
different approaches of how to

825
00:49:58,202 --> 00:50:00,916
understand ourselves in terms of what an

826
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:03,540
individual is and why it matters.

827
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,308
Yes. There's so much loaded on different

828
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:20,512
understandings among people, including

829
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:24,468
even the essence of the social, which is

830
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,670
who are people and what is the

831
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,144
obligation and how do we view that

832
00:50:33,182 --> 00:50:36,650
relationship? That's a very

833
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,696
deep area. Again, the part that just

834
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,556
kept returning to me in the lecture and

835
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:45,212
when I was trying to think about how to

836
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:49,100
even reflect part of this very large

837
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,392
area is like, what is the adjective

838
00:50:52,456 --> 00:50:56,684
doing and what's the reference

839
00:50:56,732 --> 00:50:59,696
point by which this is being said in.

840
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:03,168
The speech act like people often will

841
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:07,988
dismiss I don't mean to straw people but

842
00:51:08,154 --> 00:51:10,724
dismiss collective behavior by saying

843
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:12,068
well, we are explaining individual

844
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:14,304
behavior. What are you explaining beyond

845
00:51:14,352 --> 00:51:17,172
the nest mates in the colony and then

846
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:20,344
the exterior, that is it.

847
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:24,168
And so that can feel like looking at

848
00:51:24,174 --> 00:51:26,120
the same thing from two different sides.

849
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,424
And there are different methods, like

850
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:31,084
some methods blur over individuals a lot

851
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:35,036
more like statistical methods that might

852
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,788
correspond to demographics and then on

853
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,292
the other hand, like more agent based

854
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,220
models.

855
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,284
But how much variability and what

856
00:51:46,322 --> 00:51:49,730
shared variability in what

857
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,564
general synchronies amongst

858
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,564
different quantum reference frames? All

859
00:51:55,622 --> 00:51:59,700
these nested at least possibilities

860
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,672
that are grounded in wanting to explore

861
00:52:04,736 --> 00:52:06,320
mathematical and scientific

862
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,136
possibilities as the literature of

863
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:12,952
linear regression is full of so many

864
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:16,730
incredible extensions and similar.

865
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,164
And then I think

866
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:24,910
what the course is even beginning to

867
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,244
try to express and what I understand in

868
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:32,268
the works of the other teachers and a

869
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,920
lot of your backgrounds and everything

870
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:38,432
like that is where

871
00:52:38,486 --> 00:52:41,600
is that moment

872
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,160
where it is not only science,

873
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,764
because science is not simply the

874
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:51,876
social. So science as an activity and

875
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:54,004
then as there's a diffusion away from

876
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:54,820
science,

877
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,200
or at least that relationship between

878
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,552
social and science is right there in the

879
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:05,096
title. Maybe that's kind of like a

880
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:09,304
science major's take but it is itself in

881
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:12,984
a way presenting

882
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:16,812
a dilemma with what science means

883
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:19,084
there and then that's the frame game

884
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,300
who's doing social science? Who's doing

885
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:26,444
not social science? And that's

886
00:53:26,492 --> 00:53:30,300
where in the culture

887
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,456
I'm sitting in, in the technical side of

888
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:35,796
that it is related to statistics and

889
00:53:35,818 --> 00:53:39,940
formality. It's the Xkcd comic

890
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,820
and the way that formalisms and details

891
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,792
are taken as under

892
00:53:48,846 --> 00:53:51,560
some regimes of attention basically

893
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,936
definitive. And yet there's like

894
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:58,116
a yearning and a counterbalancing that's

895
00:53:58,148 --> 00:53:59,850
expressed also in many ways.

896
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,784
And science maybe some people feel like

897
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:07,716
certain social scientific methods that's

898
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,812
like not far enough in this dimension

899
00:54:09,876 --> 00:54:11,108
and then the others feel like they're

900
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:14,690
too far in this direction. But it's like

901
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,444
just like that academic field, let alone

902
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:21,120
any other community of diverse agents.

903
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,464
Of course there's going to be

904
00:54:22,502 --> 00:54:26,192
distributions of perspectives

905
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:29,700
at different times and

906
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,524
rate. Of uptake by those different

907
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:32,340
perspectives.

908
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,752
Daniel, do you think these

909
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:43,304
first principles would

910
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:46,584
be able to explain why an

911
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:49,944
ant colony exists? I know that was

912
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:53,230
your kind of area of interest of study.

913
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,468
Why an ant colony exists in

914
00:54:57,474 --> 00:54:59,948
the way that it does as a operating as a

915
00:54:59,954 --> 00:55:03,890
collective and why another

916
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,024
animal is able to survive and

917
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:11,200
achieve its. Goals.

918
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,156
As an individual only relying on the

919
00:55:17,178 --> 00:55:18,804
environment and its actions and

920
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:21,380
sensations to get its needs met and to

921
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,324
no doubt minimize its free energy. But

922
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:28,064
could first principles explain why

923
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:30,296
the one has to survive as a group and

924
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:32,152
the other has to survive or is able to

925
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:35,400
survive under different conditions?

926
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,736
Yeah, that's a super interesting

927
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,830
question. It's very core to this

928
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,664
individuation and multiscale

929
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:50,156
individuation concept. Like is

930
00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:51,884
the nest mate the individual and then

931
00:55:51,922 --> 00:55:54,320
the colony? Is the social? Because then

932
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,184
for sure it's super collaborative. Or is

933
00:55:57,222 --> 00:55:59,868
the colony the organism? And nest mates

934
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:02,288
are tissues and then are they social

935
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:05,216
across colony boundaries? Not where I

936
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:07,124
was in Arizona, but they're often

937
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:08,516
friendly across different species and

938
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:09,956
they avoided conflict more often than

939
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:13,236
not. And then why does it

940
00:56:13,258 --> 00:56:15,588
even matter what's happening on this

941
00:56:15,674 --> 00:56:19,032
plot of lands in

942
00:56:19,086 --> 00:56:21,492
this area? From like a biomimicry

943
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:24,328
perspective, we might learn new

944
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,432
algorithms. It's a sandbox for learning

945
00:56:27,486 --> 00:56:29,576
new techniques and observation, all

946
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:32,156
these other richnesses. So it's to say

947
00:56:32,178 --> 00:56:34,940
though, what comes away from that

948
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:39,340
science that makes it social science.

949
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,332
And I think there's a lot of

950
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:44,288
disciplinary ways of understanding that,

951
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:47,024
which I'm definitely not expert in in

952
00:56:47,062 --> 00:56:50,640
the professional fields like counseling,

953
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,370
but probably in all the different

954
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,124
humanities and histories and all these

955
00:56:57,162 --> 00:57:01,220
other fields, all these different maps,

956
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,984
the kind of social the

957
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:11,544
epistemic organizing question and then

958
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:15,976
the social organizing question and

959
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:18,120
the way that technology is also in that

960
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,856
tangle. And yeah, someone pointed out

961
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:22,970
like, this is not a new problem,

962
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,356
but then it's like, well, what parts are

963
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:29,276
new? And then what's our model by which

964
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:31,164
we're saying that it's like new or too

965
00:57:31,202 --> 00:57:32,876
individualist or too collective? On what

966
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:35,036
scale? What if they're like, really

967
00:57:35,058 --> 00:57:36,448
collectivist at this scale, but not at

968
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:39,856
this scale or another? An example of an

969
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:44,880
ambiguous or at least like polysimus

970
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,572
phenotype of colonies is in some

971
00:57:47,626 --> 00:57:49,664
colonies there's partial reproductive

972
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:54,180
activation of non reproductive

973
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,456
nest mates. And that has often been

974
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:01,656
modeled from a position of zero is the

975
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,164
law and how are they cheating above

976
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:06,664
this? But it's also been approached from

977
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:10,768
a colony level strategic bet hedging.

978
00:58:10,964 --> 00:58:14,476
So without super deep knowledge of

979
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,116
really some of the specifics of the

980
00:58:17,138 --> 00:58:19,464
regularities that that colony algorithm

981
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:23,340
had to persist for so long and

982
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,488
to have gotten swept off the table if it

983
00:58:25,494 --> 00:58:27,948
was even that's a very integrated

984
00:58:28,044 --> 00:58:31,452
problem. So it helps you approach

985
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:33,696
collective systems and learn about them.

986
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,004
But it's like there's a lot to say about

987
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:39,696
humidity loss in foraging and humidity

988
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:42,580
loss isn't even the whole picture.

989
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,300
And human foraging is a lot more

990
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,240
sophisticated from just like a

991
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:51,668
perception, cognition, influence,

992
00:58:51,764 --> 00:58:56,216
perspective. So those

993
00:58:56,238 --> 00:58:59,000
are just some ant related thoughts, but

994
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,436
it just centers a lot of discussions

995
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:02,476
that really matter. And I think the

996
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,300
really interesting piece is not always

997
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:08,188
in the way that they're thought

998
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:09,870
to by some.

999
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,416
Yeah, and it's very hard to get

1000
00:59:14,438 --> 00:59:17,952
any kind of cross pollination or to see

1001
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:22,316
cross pollination studying

1002
00:59:22,348 --> 00:59:25,056
one agent. It's quite, at least to my

1003
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:26,276
mind, very difficult to kind of

1004
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:28,292
generalize things across different

1005
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:34,784
agents. It starts getting a bit tricky

1006
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:38,420
to infer one collective's

1007
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,456
how and why and how they survive and how

1008
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:48,676
another agent does. It's tricky. So I'm

1009
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,764
almost just going to an agent. Human

1010
00:59:50,802 --> 00:59:52,604
beings, as hard as they are to study and

1011
00:59:52,642 --> 00:59:55,276
just try and run with it as far as

1012
00:59:55,298 --> 00:59:55,870
possible.

1013
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,788
Otherwise it's just information

1014
01:00:01,874 --> 01:00:02,700
overload.

1015
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,450
Body is a complex place too,

1016
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,392
and digital technology,

1017
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:21,250
virtuality, these are such

1018
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,212
richly developed topics in the social

1019
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:26,260
sciences. I only know the tiniest amount

1020
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,190
from but I think that through

1021
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,492
participation and inclusion in

1022
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,976
collaboration and in conversations and

1023
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:38,920
everything, there's going to be a lot of

1024
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,080
interesting connections and paths

1025
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,216
and it's

1026
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:52,392
being approached seemingly multiple

1027
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:55,916
layers. The two layers that just we can

1028
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:58,092
focus most narrowly on is like within

1029
01:00:58,146 --> 01:01:01,340
the realm of science, what is science?

1030
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,210
Which is kind of like playing this other

1031
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,836
role with inertia in some people's minds

1032
01:01:07,868 --> 01:01:09,456
and in systems, what is science? Who

1033
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:10,864
gets to decide what social science is?

1034
01:01:10,902 --> 01:01:12,960
I don't know. I'm not in social science

1035
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,096
but it's system of interest to society

1036
01:01:16,128 --> 01:01:18,804
and certainly I'm a part of that. So

1037
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:23,380
it's like what is good technically,

1038
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,256
what is social scientific and

1039
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:30,100
then what is that social scientific?

1040
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,176
How is that going to interface into the

1041
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:36,132
metaphysical questions and the normative

1042
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:40,312
ethical and the decision

1043
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:42,396
making with trade offs and the real

1044
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:46,590
reflexive complex decisions that matter?

1045
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,244
Also while recognizing this increasingly

1046
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:54,768
nuanced way of thinking about different

1047
01:01:54,854 --> 01:01:56,320
social intelligences,

1048
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:11,420
what's any other random thought or

1049
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,410
curiosity about collective behavior?

1050
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,286
One point that I would have added in to

1051
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:31,646
the lecture was just that in distributed

1052
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:34,340
systems, whether as modeled or as such,

1053
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,474
all behavior is arising from

1054
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:41,074
interactions local to individuals. Even

1055
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:42,526
if it's sent through some wireless

1056
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,422
mechanism, it's like all about the local

1057
01:02:44,476 --> 01:02:47,560
interactions. And so that is

1058
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:52,294
an arising type process that gives the

1059
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:56,474
modeler like one hands off layer at

1060
01:02:56,512 --> 01:03:00,042
least, if not much more. Another nice

1061
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:04,074
feature about them, they are

1062
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:07,962
in a way waiting to be composed because

1063
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:10,960
they intrinsically contain at least two

1064
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:14,782
layers of consideration. Now whether

1065
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,560
there's kind of like a forcing function

1066
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,358
of one layer and just sort of dangling a

1067
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:21,214
bottom layer or whether there's a lot of

1068
01:03:21,252 --> 01:03:22,866
what we would call emergence or

1069
01:03:22,888 --> 01:03:26,738
discussive in that way that more

1070
01:03:26,824 --> 01:03:29,906
arising function can be modeled. But in

1071
01:03:29,928 --> 01:03:32,094
either way then you can kind of wrap

1072
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:35,154
that two layer system and then compose

1073
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:37,798
them. So that's like what enables in

1074
01:03:37,804 --> 01:03:39,750
certain situations like parallelization

1075
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:43,206
or at least that's obviously a big area.

1076
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:46,440
But that's what allows multi agent

1077
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:51,306
simulation frameworks to do well

1078
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:55,578
on certain very challenging sense making

1079
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:58,394
and action selection problems, not by

1080
01:03:58,432 --> 01:04:02,000
guarantee or default because any given

1081
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,480
slicing and dicing of any given

1082
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,726
prompting of information may not help

1083
01:04:07,748 --> 01:04:11,242
you adapt but

1084
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,940
there are paths that do and don't help,

1085
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:17,810
persist or not. And that's this kind of

1086
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,220
persistence starting place that we

1087
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,290
began with. Sasha.

1088
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,804
Yeah, I really resonate with what you

1089
01:04:29,842 --> 01:04:32,296
mentioned about the local interactions

1090
01:04:32,488 --> 01:04:36,204
that even if

1091
01:04:36,242 --> 01:04:39,120
information is transmitted over long

1092
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:44,284
distances then the agents behave

1093
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:47,104
in a way that is locally relevant and

1094
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:49,836
integrates that information. And it

1095
01:04:49,878 --> 01:04:52,036
actually makes me think a lot about the

1096
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:56,020
psychology therapy angle that

1097
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:00,310
while you try to get information about

1098
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,132
the person's sort of local environment

1099
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:08,052
and behavior or perhaps

1100
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:11,480
demographics and age, that their

1101
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:14,864
informational environment, like a wealth

1102
01:05:14,932 --> 01:05:17,324
of what kind of information they

1103
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:20,952
consume, might also be really telling

1104
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:26,488
about their psychological

1105
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:30,204
and behavior interactions

1106
01:05:30,252 --> 01:05:31,360
or pathologies.

1107
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,732
And then to bring it kind of full circle

1108
01:05:36,796 --> 01:05:40,864
back to that the researcher

1109
01:05:40,912 --> 01:05:44,470
is part of the ecosystem that they are

1110
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,020
studying.

1111
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,444
Yeah, I think it's just such

1112
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,944
a difference in perspective to see that

1113
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:59,736
as like a positive and a gift that the

1114
01:05:59,758 --> 01:06:01,656
way that you would design and run an

1115
01:06:01,678 --> 01:06:03,976
experiment today is not the way that you

1116
01:06:03,998 --> 01:06:06,124
would do it two years from now with more

1117
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:12,396
experience. And so that is a

1118
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:14,444
benefit and like a bonus in the system

1119
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:17,936
and not like a negative perspective of

1120
01:06:18,038 --> 01:06:20,960
bias that it's detracting from some

1121
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:25,280
underlying truth or reality.

1122
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,960
So, just a few thoughts.

1123
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,712
Very interesting. Anyone want to add

1124
01:06:37,766 --> 01:06:38,370
something?

1125
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,682
I think we didn't fully resolve this

1126
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,634
early question about the umvelt term

1127
01:06:49,702 --> 01:06:52,398
from ethology behavioral research

1128
01:06:52,484 --> 01:06:55,886
observation science using the

1129
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:57,886
term to describe the world as it is

1130
01:06:57,908 --> 01:07:01,006
experienced by a particular organism. I

1131
01:07:01,028 --> 01:07:02,778
think a few different pieces and there's

1132
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:05,058
a lot of discussion in discourse. This

1133
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,866
is just to give it like a super short

1134
01:07:06,968 --> 01:07:10,434
overview the world we might connect to

1135
01:07:10,472 --> 01:07:12,946
world modeling and there's a lot of

1136
01:07:12,968 --> 01:07:15,078
interesting work in all kinds of

1137
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:18,642
different pros focus on qualitative

1138
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:21,686
systems as well as some artificial or

1139
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,550
synthetic intelligence. World modeling

1140
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:28,138
as it is experienced is one of the

1141
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:31,370
sticky and deep ones because this is the

1142
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,066
area of phenomenology. And so this is

1143
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:37,494
like a kind of semi eternal discussion

1144
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:40,394
point. So whether active inference

1145
01:07:40,442 --> 01:07:42,926
delivers on world modeling is kind of

1146
01:07:42,948 --> 01:07:46,366
empirical and just plain whereas as it

1147
01:07:46,388 --> 01:07:48,158
is experienced is going to be a

1148
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,118
philosophical question and then by a

1149
01:07:51,124 --> 01:07:54,546
particular organism that specificity we

1150
01:07:54,568 --> 01:07:56,462
get by actually making the generative

1151
01:07:56,526 --> 01:07:58,974
model even if we're just speculating

1152
01:07:59,022 --> 01:08:01,922
about it. It's like talking about

1153
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:05,286
experience without an experiencer would

1154
01:08:05,308 --> 01:08:09,026
be like talking about some agent's

1155
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:12,710
behavior without reference to its niche.

1156
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,862
And then where there is like that

1157
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:19,546
complex negotiation I think the

1158
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:20,922
humanities and a lot of the social

1159
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:24,860
sciences have identified a lot of the

1160
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,474
structural top down and also the

1161
01:08:28,512 --> 01:08:32,986
personal bottom up motifs

1162
01:08:33,018 --> 01:08:37,594
of things being blurred

1163
01:08:37,642 --> 01:08:41,166
and made complex. And so

1164
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:43,266
I think part of the social and the

1165
01:08:43,288 --> 01:08:45,218
scientific as coming only from the

1166
01:08:45,224 --> 01:08:48,500
scientific side is like to

1167
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:52,786
meet in the third space and or at

1168
01:08:52,808 --> 01:08:56,114
least make it work to have a mutual

1169
01:08:56,162 --> 01:09:00,120
compromise where it's like certain

1170
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:04,054
social oriented claims based upon this

1171
01:09:04,092 --> 01:09:06,518
scientific measure that is going to be a

1172
01:09:06,524 --> 01:09:09,130
judgment call. But understanding that

1173
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,614
conversation, where is it a mutual

1174
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:13,802
compromise? In what dimensions? Not

1175
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:15,942
simply along the kind of rigor,

1176
01:09:16,006 --> 01:09:18,246
accessibility or implications axis.

1177
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:20,286
There's just very many things in play in

1178
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:23,118
these Iterated relationships in

1179
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:24,510
ecosystems,

1180
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,056
having a researcher as part of the

1181
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:43,212
ecosystem. Well, here's the forager

1182
01:09:43,276 --> 01:09:45,248
question. We see the nest mate on the

1183
01:09:45,254 --> 01:09:47,104
ground, it's a forager. But then we step

1184
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:48,444
back, it's like, okay, well, it's

1185
01:09:48,492 --> 01:09:51,856
foraging. And then that's the allocation

1186
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:54,404
of the forager. Then its foraging is

1187
01:09:54,442 --> 01:09:57,796
still part of this sense making, this

1188
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,972
generative sense making with process

1189
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:03,636
understanding even of a trace,

1190
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:05,976
which is something that Bruno Latour and

1191
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,704
others have explored with, like

1192
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:10,196
following a trace in a social setting

1193
01:10:10,228 --> 01:10:13,720
and using that to trace networks.

1194
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,084
So in our digital ecosystems, though,

1195
01:10:17,122 --> 01:10:20,252
our information ecosystems is not

1196
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:23,948
research happening. And so what

1197
01:10:23,954 --> 01:10:26,108
does that really mean? And then what are

1198
01:10:26,114 --> 01:10:29,296
those social normativities? There is

1199
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:31,356
going to be like a meeting or a handoff

1200
01:10:31,388 --> 01:10:35,090
with where that really is happening,

1201
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,608
or maybe it's a knocking on the door

1202
01:10:39,644 --> 01:10:40,660
that's ignored.

1203
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,784
Or it could be whatever metaphor

1204
01:10:46,912 --> 01:10:49,476
in that setting it actually is.

1205
01:10:49,658 --> 01:10:51,284
There's no general metaphor because

1206
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:52,472
that'd be like, oh, what's the general

1207
01:10:52,526 --> 01:10:54,984
metaphor on this experiment? Which

1208
01:10:55,022 --> 01:10:58,776
experiment? Just the general action that

1209
01:10:58,798 --> 01:11:00,250
we plan to take. Oh,

1210
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,290
hard to say.

1211
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:32,804
It okay. Well, in our last sections,

1212
01:11:32,852 --> 01:11:35,704
I guess if anybody types a question live

1213
01:11:35,742 --> 01:11:37,632
chat we'll look at, otherwise, what are

1214
01:11:37,686 --> 01:11:39,330
any other thoughts? Or like,

1215
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,472
what what can we learn

1216
01:11:48,526 --> 01:11:50,840
more about about collective behavior?

1217
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,532
Or what will it mean for our sense

1218
01:11:53,586 --> 01:11:55,036
making, decision making, if we

1219
01:11:55,058 --> 01:11:56,990
understand collective behavior better?

1220
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:01,846
What else are people excited about for

1221
01:13:01,868 --> 01:13:03,320
the rest of the course?

1222
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,514
Like, based upon the sections that we've

1223
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:16,758
done so far and

1224
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:20,662
how we can even start to approach

1225
01:13:20,726 --> 01:13:23,930
this in an acknowledged, limited,

1226
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,620
finite way?

1227
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,620
Yeah. Sasha than anyone else.

1228
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,046
I just added a question to the very

1229
01:13:36,068 --> 01:13:38,574
bottom of the notes, and it makes me

1230
01:13:38,612 --> 01:13:41,534
think about how, working on this

1231
01:13:41,572 --> 01:13:43,906
document collaboratively throughout the

1232
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:48,146
last hour, we're able to kind

1233
01:13:48,168 --> 01:13:50,722
of leave a stigmagic trace of things

1234
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:54,302
we've discussed. And what sort of traits

1235
01:13:54,366 --> 01:13:58,690
or practices should individual humans

1236
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:01,254
I guess I should specify humans. Should

1237
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:04,150
we embody in order to improve cohesion

1238
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,778
in collective behavior? It makes me

1239
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:12,918
think of certain psychology traits

1240
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:17,610
or descriptions of, like, openness or

1241
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,130
conscientiousness.

1242
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:24,670
What will make individual humans

1243
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:29,466
better participants in collective

1244
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:30,270
behavior?

1245
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:40,620
Yeah, I think to add to that,

1246
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:43,942
to just emphasize the importance,

1247
01:14:44,006 --> 01:14:47,820
again, only with human agents,

1248
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:51,614
specifically, who have the capacity to

1249
01:14:51,652 --> 01:14:55,214
think and reflect, and the only ones

1250
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:59,514
that have those really advanced

1251
01:14:59,642 --> 01:15:02,058
capabilities that we know of as yet,

1252
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:06,866
but to really kind of leverage in

1253
01:15:06,968 --> 01:15:09,010
order to make the collective better.

1254
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,034
There's a responsibility of the

1255
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:16,006
individual, despite being part of

1256
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:18,946
a collective on many different fronts,

1257
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:22,054
to be able to leverage and utilize their

1258
01:15:22,092 --> 01:15:25,654
own internal states and

1259
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,866
what they have learned, and to be able

1260
01:15:27,888 --> 01:15:31,610
to think, to retain

1261
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:35,322
the individual's mind and think about

1262
01:15:35,376 --> 01:15:38,426
the collective, I think is so important

1263
01:15:38,608 --> 01:15:43,246
if the collective is to become

1264
01:15:43,348 --> 01:15:45,982
healthier. Sasha, to your point, and to

1265
01:15:46,036 --> 01:15:47,040
improve. Its.

1266
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,304
To become more conscientious and become

1267
01:15:54,362 --> 01:15:57,464
more responsible or whatever that might

1268
01:15:57,502 --> 01:15:58,090
be.

1269
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,620
So to always try and maintain a thinking

1270
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,670
self is crucial.

1271
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:17,214
You can very easily be usurped into the

1272
01:16:17,252 --> 01:16:18,640
collective as is.

1273
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,862
If you just go on any social media

1274
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:27,854
platform, you will see individuals

1275
01:16:27,902 --> 01:16:31,298
rarely thinking for themselves

1276
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:34,786
and seemingly kind of just fueling each

1277
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:36,920
other. And that causes massive problems.

1278
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:40,646
So an individual mind strikes me as

1279
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:42,566
being just the most important thing in

1280
01:16:42,588 --> 01:16:44,600
the future going forward.

1281
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,542
It yeah. This dialectic with

1282
01:16:53,596 --> 01:16:57,094
individuation and collectivization as

1283
01:16:57,132 --> 01:17:01,322
these ongoing negotiated compromise

1284
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:03,246
that can be also viewed many ways.

1285
01:17:03,348 --> 01:17:12,792
However, they are cognitive

1286
01:17:12,856 --> 01:17:14,590
science coming into play.

1287
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:21,090
Maybe historical processes or

1288
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:27,696
philosophies were used

1289
01:17:27,798 --> 01:17:32,292
in many settings for even

1290
01:17:32,346 --> 01:17:33,860
approaching these kinds of social

1291
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:37,824
questions. And now with computer science

1292
01:17:37,872 --> 01:17:41,444
and technology, it even is a

1293
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:45,704
discussion more about the capacities of

1294
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:49,224
measurement and action. Not that those

1295
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:51,624
are new in and of themselves, but

1296
01:17:51,662 --> 01:17:53,096
thinking like a state, like the

1297
01:17:53,118 --> 01:17:55,756
development of the apparatus, the

1298
01:17:55,778 --> 01:17:58,284
development of the social systems that

1299
01:17:58,322 --> 01:18:01,544
can be run on open source hardware,

1300
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:03,550
open source software, things like that.

1301
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,572
I don't know if something's generalized

1302
01:18:10,636 --> 01:18:13,200
across all such groups,

1303
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,012
but understanding

1304
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:21,200
what environments, at least initially

1305
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,524
things are beginning at is

1306
01:18:25,562 --> 01:18:27,590
just a realist starting point.

1307
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,764
Probably no guarantee since most things,

1308
01:18:31,882 --> 01:18:35,224
all things are swept off the table in

1309
01:18:35,262 --> 01:18:36,810
their specifics anyway.

1310
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,624
And how to deal with that kind of like

1311
01:18:43,662 --> 01:18:47,084
skin on the line type

1312
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:49,900
of decision making is very interesting

1313
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:54,572
how it's pursued in the sciences because

1314
01:18:54,626 --> 01:18:57,404
often many runs are presented or that

1315
01:18:57,442 --> 01:19:00,016
kind of catastrophic failure mode of

1316
01:19:00,038 --> 01:19:01,936
models is not considered. It's just like

1317
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:06,384
part of the training, starting naive so

1318
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,576
just the way that different social

1319
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:12,052
considerations are

1320
01:19:12,106 --> 01:19:15,444
converged upon. It's not like reduced to

1321
01:19:15,482 --> 01:19:19,316
one feature of the social because the

1322
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,110
social is such an open space.

1323
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,472
As a scientist, always impressed by how

1324
01:19:26,526 --> 01:19:31,290
that writing could kind of open up the

1325
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,164
situations which are, like, mundane,

1326
01:19:34,212 --> 01:19:37,324
but also, of course, very deep and

1327
01:19:37,362 --> 01:19:40,364
meaningful. Also, though,

1328
01:19:40,562 --> 01:19:41,580
mundane.

1329
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,796
Any other thoughts or

1330
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:26,780
otherwise on collective behavior or on

1331
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:29,810
the social sciences course or anything?

1332
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,552
Otherwise people can have any last words

1333
01:20:33,606 --> 01:20:34,610
if they want.

1334
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,754
Yeah. Awesome. Thank you all for

1335
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:45,106
participating. David, want to add

1336
01:20:45,128 --> 01:20:46,210
anything? Excellent.

1337
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,102
Yeah. Well, I look forward to more

1338
01:20:58,156 --> 01:21:00,200
questions being asked on the course

1339
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:04,446
website. And everybody's engagement with

1340
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:07,006
the course is very much appreciated. So

1341
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:09,214
keep up the collective. Thanks for

1342
01:21:09,252 --> 01:21:11,566
multiscale learning, and it's a fun

1343
01:21:11,668 --> 01:21:13,886
course. Really happy that we could have

1344
01:21:13,908 --> 01:21:15,774
done the session and very happy to have

1345
01:21:15,812 --> 01:21:17,070
concluded the session.

1346
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:22,986
All right, thank you. Bye bye. Bern
