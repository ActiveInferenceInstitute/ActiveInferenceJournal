1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,639
hello and welcome it's August 16 2023

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,839
we're in the collective Behavior

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,000
discussion section of the active

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,520
inference for the social sciences course

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,439
in 2023.

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,699
so perhaps let us all go around

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,820
and give a opening

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,140
introduction and or reflection

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,079
and see who joins and what happens from

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,780
there but just so that everybody has

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,200
said hello

12
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,399
Jim hi everyone I'm Brynn and uh 9 pm in

13
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,500
South Africa and uh

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,960
yeah just excited to be here see what

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,079
happens

16
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,140
hi I'm Andrew I'm a graduate student in

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,119
Indiana and

18
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,240
um

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,439
I guess my

20
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,600
field of uh interest now is the

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,759
Knowledge Management and I think that

22
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,460
figuring out how we collectively learn

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,920
and can

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,299
um

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,340
share information my teacher is a really

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,500
interesting topic and I'd like to see

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,700
how this would apply

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,240
Regina and I'm performing with them now

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,740
that I'm living in Spain

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,040
studying and doing experiments related

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,079
to this topic and trying to learn a

32
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,420
little bit of the

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,540
um Theory that's behind it so it can you

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,920
know Advance better

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,759
I'm excited

36
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,060
hello my name is Sasha I'm calling in

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,460
from California I'm also a graduate

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,780
student

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,979
um yeah just really enjoyed the spirited

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,080
presentation last week I'm looking

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,040
forward to a discussion

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
all right well

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,780
how about anyone can

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,160
give a first reflection on Collective

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,200
Behavior or what

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,540
what was their

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,599
thought or context before and where are

48
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,079
they at as we kind of begin yeah Regina

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,440
okay so I just want to make sure that I

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,400
understand because I took like two big

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,900
lessons from your lesson right and the

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,519
first one is that

53
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,760
um you know this this famous model of

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,239
active inference that has the agent and

55
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,500
the environment and the Markov blanket

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
in the middle right and just interacts

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,660
with everything right so I think what I

58
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,540
got from what you discussed

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,980
um maybe I didn't have a good definition

60
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,879
of an agent but first that you can have

61
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,580
that agent not be just an individual

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,760
but also your definition of an

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,000
individual changes depending on what you

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,480
want to study in the behavior right so

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,580
an agent can be an aunt it can be an

66
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,400
ecosystem it can be an eye looking at

67
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,340
something or it can be a as a society

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,040
for example and I think that's a big

69
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,379
take for me because it changes a lot the

70
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,440
concept of how to study things and use

71
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,739
active imprints just by changing how big

72
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,840
the agent can be

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,940
so I don't know if like I got that right

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,879
right so first that clarification

75
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,920
so what is an agent

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,819
yeah so I don't know if there's like a

77
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,040
formal definition of an agent in active

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,540
inference right but uh if we

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,000
if we want to study whatever we want to

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
study because um I'll study because I

81
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,160
have to do that's like my goal whatever

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,360
I'm doing so I want to study whatever I

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,220
have to choose what's going to be my

84
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,680
agent and the environment it has

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,400
so choosing the agent you can do it to

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,560
create a model or to make an experiment

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
whatever but

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
um the choice you make it will depend on

89
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,479
your

90
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,940
in what you understand an individual or

91
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,639
as an agent I think so right

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,040
awesome anyone have a thought on that no

93
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,919
but if if I continued you know just to

94
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,960
add something else and this will be my

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
my

96
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,940
um and then I'm thinking is that

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,900
um

98
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,600
also a big problem that we have or I

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,940
think I have is that since I am part of

100
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,160
the environment

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,960
um you know you know the perspective of

102
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,360
whoever is studying whatever it is it's

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,120
also going to be an effect in it so

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,060
maybe maybe scientists already decided

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,280
but I don't know that we can never have

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,120
an objective way of studying something

107
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
if you're part of the environment of the

108
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
agent

109
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
so I don't know we already forgot it or

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,340
we already decided that's it we cannot

111
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,440
have objective observations of behavior

112
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,400
in general

113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,860
but you know you always think about like

114
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,160
the agent environment and you studying

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,259
it as something else but this something

116
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,380
else is also effect in it so I see that

117
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,600
as a problem or maybe something that has

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,759
to be said like we are not objective

119
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,740
because we're part of what it's

120
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,460
affecting our ages in the behavior

121
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,419
collectively too

122
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,180
so those are the the thoughts I have to

123
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,360
share

124
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,000
uh Regina I'm uh I'm also new to to all

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
of this so my preliminary understanding

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,600
of of orders and agent is uh anything

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,380
that has any good reason uh to

128
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,759
self-evidence and to itself or to

129
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,380
survive

130
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,660
um that doesn't want to dissipate that

131
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,060
might delineate the boundary of what an

132
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,660
agent is that then sits at

133
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,139
uh um

134
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,160
the boundaries with which it um will

135
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,800
as you described start interacting

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,139
with the world with the environment

137
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,539
so if something as I understand it if

138
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,120
something has a reason to go on being to

139
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,100
survive

140
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,139
um

141
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,319
um then it is an agent in the world

142
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,180
okay but but that agent could be

143
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,940
anything right like

144
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,199
is that what you're saying right like if

145
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,300
he wants to survive it can be an ant

146
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,020
surviving individually or a cell or or a

147
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,419
group okay yeah that's a good that's

148
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,258
like a good definition

149
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,818
okay

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,300
yeah Sasha

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,380
um great points Regina

152
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,419
um so much to say there

153
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,340
um something that I have experienced

154
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,759
with um as a researcher in biology is

155
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
deciding the kind of

156
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
um

157
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,940
the statistics or sampling approach to

158
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,940
use whether we're taking you know one

159
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,060
cell from one individual or we're taking

160
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,020
many cells from many individuals and how

161
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,479
to do the statistics and kind of

162
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,880
um sampling approach on that

163
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,160
um that is a you know an evergreen

164
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,900
question that we're always reevaluating

165
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,120
to see um

166
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,099
how to think about the independencies

167
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,819
within biological systems

168
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,780
um

169
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,460
and then another thing that you

170
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,719
mentioned was about the individual being

171
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,299
part of the ecosystem and that makes me

172
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,940
think a lot about complexity science and

173
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,880
something that um is addressed there in

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,219
uh thinking about the interplay of the

175
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,279
scientists and what they're studying

176
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,660
yeah thank you for those points

177
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,260
especially I can

178
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,300
sorry I'm not raising my hand I'm just

179
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,160
I'm using it

180
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,080
that's okay can you say a bit more about

181
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,540
what you mean by complexity designs is

182
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,140
baby muted

183
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,819
oh can't speak at the moment

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
yeah

185
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,459
complexity science has looked at Asian

186
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,380
asia-based modeling as a fundamental

187
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,820
tool John Holland signals and boundaries

188
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,560
focusing on what

189
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,480
from an active inference side we might

190
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,339
say it's like message passing or

191
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,160
communication for the messages and then

192
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
boundaries with

193
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
the whole discussion around

194
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,820
the boundaries in the world map

195
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,540
territory map territory fallacy map

196
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,200
territory fallacy fallacy

197
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,080
doing iterative modeling

198
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,380
Sasha brought up limited experimental

199
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,540
resources in in the scientific setting

200
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,600
and that's kind of analogous to The

201
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,060
Limited energy budget or attentional

202
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
budget ultimately or just

203
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,660
decision-making budget

204
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,640
of uh

205
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,720
the kinds of active entities that

206
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,519
make sense to model the ones that kind

207
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,680
of have those uh characteristics

208
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,240
this is really the question of what

209
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,339
makes something first principles or what

210
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,500
are the first principles

211
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,740
one aspect of it as brought up

212
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,760
is the censoring of the persistence so

213
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,560
from the outside that's kind of like an

214
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,660
empiricists view of persistence like is

215
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,040
it measurable

216
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,980
but not saying that something is

217
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,720
necessarily that which is the

218
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,760
statistical tool and then the sort of

219
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
like inside out

220
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,160
implementation type

221
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,660
but

222
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,360
there's a lot more to say in that who

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,560
wants to

224
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,300
bring in some

225
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,000
New Angle or

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,060
how do they see Collective Behavior

227
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,779
why do we talk about Collective Behavior

228
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,940
why not just Behavior recognize that

229
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,459
behavior is multi-scale or or social

230
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,860
what's really being

231
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,079
communicated with the collective

232
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,279
I mean I I believe that we chose those

233
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,440
levels so we can make it more simple for

234
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
our brains to understand it because if

235
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
we talk about Collective Behavior

236
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,779
actually is the universe behaving and

237
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,220
the particles and everything right

238
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,660
so I don't know if that's a little bit

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
just based on I don't know what's the

240
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,000
word like just in the material world and

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,760
how it physically moves and that's like

242
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,100
deterministic or whatever right

243
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,600
but

244
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
um

245
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,860
I think us we chose to have those

246
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,660
limitations so we could understand the

247
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,700
world but also we should acknowledge

248
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,920
that are limited because we're part of

249
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,339
the system

250
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,260
I'm having a little trouble on my kind

251
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,839
of understanding the

252
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,060
I guess the where the

253
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,540
Schism lies between kind of the

254
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,800
the Markov blanket and uh the um well in

255
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,639
uh semiotics of like the animals uh

256
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,720
sensory experience

257
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,480
anyone have a maybe maybe someone could

258
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,100
uh I mean Daniel Dino

259
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,459
like the difference between that too

260
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,380
um can you be a little louder thank you

261
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,360
though Andrew anyone have a thought on

262
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,040
that

263
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,320
I'll bring in a definition of whom felt

264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,600
then and then we can see but meanwhile

265
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,560
does anyone have a thought

266
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,079
sorry sorry I was just muted on Andrew

267
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,399
you're a little quiet

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,220
but um I'm gonna bring in a definition

269
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,220
of umvelt and then meanwhile does anyone

270
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,880
have a thought

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,260
I I hope I'm not uh

272
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,560
where the diluting Andrew's uh uh

273
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
question

274
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,579
um

275
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,120
but

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,940
I think a collective behavior in kind of

277
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,519
like a I don't know football team or

278
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,260
soccer team

279
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,600
um and what that provides

280
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,040
uh

281
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,200
the grip who is uh

282
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,019
share some common ethos and what that

283
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,459
does to the

284
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,760
how that regulates the their Collective

285
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,260
or individual and Collective free

286
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,060
energies

287
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,339
um during a match or throughout the

288
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,740
season and how that

289
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,680
that gives some

290
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,519
uh

291
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,500
yeah some charge to

292
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,100
uh some Investments because it's my team

293
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,440
against yours

294
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,180
and we have to

295
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,260
um try and win and so you know without

296
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,500
it without that Collective Behavior

297
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,000
um

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,839
it's it's might be far harder to achieve

299
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,720
the group's goals if they aren't able to

300
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,240
collaborate and share

301
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,899
um you know implicitly and explicitly

302
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,360
certain traits behaviors thoughts

303
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,579
feelings ideals ideologies whatever they

304
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,760
might be and how that's been

305
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,860
allows us to compete in the world

306
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,760
I I thought you think it's

307
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,240
yes okay okay I see what you're saying

308
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,320
uh especially because we're watching

309
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
over the World Cup right Women's World

310
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,699
Cup

311
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:39,120
yes it's very relevant yeah but I see

312
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,459
that in all the

313
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,699
there's things you've said it seems that

314
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,860
for your behavior needs to have like a

315
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,339
goal and I don't know if I if I agree

316
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,620
with that it's either survival or

317
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,480
winning

318
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,399
but main for me it's just something that

319
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,860
happens and maybe the consequences

320
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,180
surviving

321
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,360
but it's not the goal to survive or to

322
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,740
win the game

323
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,839
I mean in in the football it is right

324
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,459
but in general

325
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,600
um maybe there's no goal to the behavior

326
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,399
collectively

327
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,899
and just

328
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,760
just a thought

329
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,199
it's interesting

330
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,380
yeah all the great comments well the

331
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,380
paper of Connor Hines at all on the

332
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,880
collective Behavior as surprise

333
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,320
minimization

334
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,019
that points the way towards

335
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,259
using the actin fontology these kinds of

336
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,940
modeling approaches for Collective

337
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,920
behavioral situations

338
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,899
and really just recognizing them as a

339
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,019
certain type of Behavioral modeling the

340
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,800
simplest case might just be a single

341
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,860
closed system

342
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,259
all part of the

343
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,120
composition

344
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,100
that leads to

345
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,699
the ability to describe at very least

346
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,500
a lot of different kinds of systems just

347
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,059
like a linear model can describe a lot

348
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,619
of systems so then

349
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,859
it's also really interesting a topic

350
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,660
that came up in one of the recent

351
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,819
textbook groups

352
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,579
with what's normative about active

353
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,780
inference because the term of

354
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,119
uh the process Theory even of active

355
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,439
inference

356
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,140
being normative is mentioned multiple

357
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,720
times and that's definitely a topic that

358
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,620
connects to the social sciences one can

359
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,940
imagine the kind of Niche normativity or

360
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,600
niche regularities in a broad sense

361
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,960
and then the real minute particulars of

362
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,799
how they play out which kind of hints at

363
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,419
the kind of descriptive or causal

364
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,960
minimum

365
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,880
to start making some anything but toy

366
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,260
specific generative models

367
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
so it's been an interesting theme to see

368
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,380
even already in

369
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,460
avells and Ben's lectures and

370
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,860
discussions

371
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,400
this question between

372
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,020
description

373
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,720
process of describing

374
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,840
which is what I associated with

375
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,179
Professor Gordon's approach to ant

376
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,740
watching

377
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,860
how that descriptive process which is

378
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,380
what we can say that we have for active

379
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,100
inference just like a linear modeling

380
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,480
ecosystem could say about their linear

381
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,600
modeling in principle

382
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,559
um and how to then

383
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,320
articulate the normativities of the

384
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,940
framework

385
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,120
if that concept if that separation can

386
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,039
even exist

387
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,260
from the

388
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,980
uh Behavioral normativities

389
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,140
that include

390
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,320
the basis of social Fabric in

391
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,360
all different kinds of communities

392
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,640
here's another question so

393
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,679
what is the role of any technical detail

394
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,559
in in the social sciences

395
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,740
whether more on the statistical

396
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,679
connecting with data

397
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,520
or more category theoretic-like

398
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,559
just formal

399
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,520
what's the role of formal methods

400
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,980
in

401
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,000
different kinds of academic or practical

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,500
Expressions about social systems

403
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,280
doesn't matter at all

404
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,780
how we think about

405
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,380
a framework at all

406
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,580
well

407
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,980
for formalizing

408
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,299
um

409
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,240
aspects of a social system that I would

410
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,520
say that the purpose is for

411
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,440
communication

412
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,740
between individuals

413
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,299
because just

414
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,780
you know we can't verify that

415
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,200
well formalizing it is just setting a

416
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,039
system on top of what you're observing

417
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,120
um but there is no explicit

418
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,400
uh guarantee that you're saying

419
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,500
encompasses everything of the phenomena

420
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,820
you're observing

421
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,600
and

422
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,720
just

423
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,760
like you know kind of going back to

424
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,059
taoism of like the name that can be

425
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:39,240
named is not the true Eternal name and

426
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,720
so it's just a way of

427
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,419
you know it's it's a slice of what we

428
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:46,740
can observe

429
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,179
and

430
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,120
the way to um

431
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,980
you know maybe you can make predictions

432
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,500
or maybe you can generate something that

433
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,360
acts like

434
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
the the phenomena phenomena you're

435
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,740
observing but

436
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,900
um so it's just it's a way to kind of

437
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,919
it's just a way to kind of approximate

438
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,059
our understanding of some phenomena and

439
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:16,380
you have to slice it in a specific way

440
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,299
but also understanding that it is a

441
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,980
slice or you know it is a tangent line

442
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,159
that you're approximating as opposed to

443
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,880
encompassing the whole system from

444
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,000
verbalizing it

445
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,440
um I will uh maybe it's not the goal but

446
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,140
something that happens out of describing

447
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,580
any system like Andrew said it's like

448
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,600
um the goal to modify it or to

449
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,080
or to corrupt it in some way to gain

450
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,020
control or whatever we know the model

451
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,080
you know how to play the game kinda

452
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,980
so you write instructions and try to see

453
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,440
if you can

454
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,360
outsmart someone else I mean it sounds

455
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,419
kind of dark right but maybe it's one of

456
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,220
the goals to or something that just

457
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,140
happens out of knowing the rules that

458
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,280
nobody else knows

459
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,740
I mean I guess when you when you talk

460
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,340
about control there is a

461
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,820
there there is a shade that can be

462
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,179
um gained from that specific wording but

463
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,460
control in terms of you know control

464
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,559
theory or you know that that comes from

465
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,039
electrical engineering it's really just

466
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,820
what

467
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,419
um

468
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,460
what shapes the behavior or what are

469
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,840
they what are the inputs that drive the

470
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,240
the behavior and when you're talking

471
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,559
about control

472
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,480
it's really just about

473
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
um well if you change these inputs how

474
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,380
does that change the end behavior and so

475
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,940
you can actually

476
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,919
you know from electrical engineering of

477
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,820
controlling a

478
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,460
some sort of electromechanical system

479
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,559
but then you can make analogous

480
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,159
statements on like control into society

481
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,980
which doesn't necessarily mean like the

482
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,600
dark negative control but like you know

483
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,760
maybe there's some pathological behavior

484
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,240
in in a society or uh you know even

485
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,700
pathological

486
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,140
um

487
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,900
um

488
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,039
pathological responses within the brain

489
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,020
and it's like well what is what is

490
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,840
driving that and is it possible to to

491
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,940
change those those

492
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,620
change the drivers of that to have

493
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,500
something that is a more

494
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,940
beneficial to the system

495
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,880
yeah just just to add

496
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,539
um to what Andrew's saying because it

497
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,460
matters

498
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,340
sometimes how you manipulate

499
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,460
um uh you know

500
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,880
a a system or it matters how you affect

501
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,659
a brain so it cannot be random I mean uh

502
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,700
you know we've come a long way

503
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,600
for example from lobotomy uh which had

504
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,900
disastrous effects and and you you it

505
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,260
matters to a system how you affect it

506
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,820
and so to know

507
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,500
more formally

508
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,460
uh the most effective way to create a

509
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,340
desired effect whatever that might be

510
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,020
and it's essential that it's not just

511
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,539
kind of poking and prodding there's like

512
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,240
that that has

513
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,240
[Music]

514
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,159
as much as that has is part of the

515
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,360
scientific method to update that method

516
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,919
in accordance with what you're learning

517
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,080
so it is is important

518
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
um

519
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,279
no I think we're both writing it doesn't

520
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,159
have to be dark but also something else

521
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,120
that Andrew said about predicting I

522
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,960
think that's what also the the big goals

523
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,779
trying to predict whether to be prepared

524
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,640
to

525
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,159
or or

526
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,779
just to I mean it couldn't be to control

527
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,059
right but if you if you can somehow

528
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,140
predict

529
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,020
how people respond to days or how a

530
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,720
system will behave in this other

531
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,140
scenario you can you know change what

532
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,659
the input is or

533
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,940
prepare for whatever comes I guess

534
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,299
yeah

535
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,880
a lot of great points some of the

536
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,059
commonly held not not equally by

537
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,220
everyone everyone but

538
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,100
some of the attendance of science

539
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,380
being to explain predict design and

540
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,419
control

541
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,020
where explanation and prediction

542
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,659
are on the pathway towards uh systems

543
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,299
designing and and maintenance and other

544
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,700
other words that people can add but

545
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,400
that's the pragmatic utility oriented

546
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,480
View

547
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,640
which doesn't have to be an absolutist

548
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,440
view but certainly there are regimes of

549
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,200
attention socially now and seemingly for

550
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,020
long long times where people were

551
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,080
wanting to

552
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,480
retain and to constrain the variance

553
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,740
distribution

554
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,220
on what we would say is their generative

555
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,900
model some Norm

556
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,299
and then other times engaging in these

557
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,600
functions and that instrumentalist usage

558
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,820
of active inference is like we're going

559
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,620
to be able to model it

560
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,880
with

561
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,279
a pretty minimum

562
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,159
framework that's commonly used in

563
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,919
statistical systems where some things we

564
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,419
observe and some we don't

565
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,700
and at least we know and how all the

566
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,320
pieces are connected

567
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,960
and then that is an artifact in

568
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,240
model-based design

569
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,039
as people

570
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,840
um

571
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,740
develop that line through time socially

572
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,260
just like probably has been always the

573
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,120
case for a complex

574
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,620
projects and scientific collaboration

575
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,320
there's a few other interesting pieces

576
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,020
yeah please please

577
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,260
I'm just I'm just wondering if well now

578
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,720
that I'm thinking out loud

579
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,880
um isn't that like a problem

580
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,020
or confirmation bias right like there's

581
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,299
a paper of in here here because we

582
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,620
create the knowledge and we tell

583
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,659
everyone the knowledge this is the model

584
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,299
this is how everything behaves and then

585
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,600
we update our knowledge about it and

586
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,840
then we look for everything to just you

587
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,020
know confirm it and

588
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,820
and yeah

589
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,919
maybe there's another system that will

590
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,580
not let us be getting knowledge so

591
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,620
slowly because if everybody just agrees

592
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,600
on something we teach it to everyone and

593
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,940
we confirm the model and then we just

594
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,740
try to look for evidence for that model

595
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,740
then we go slowly if there's any better

596
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,260
thing or better model that comes along

597
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,080
you have a lot to say about that like

598
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,140
if we believe that trees exist or that

599
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,820
people exist and then we come to see

600
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,500
them so there's kind of this sense where

601
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,240
problem confirmation bias which I think

602
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,580
is a great term a great topic to bring

603
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,600
in

604
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,880
with definitely also what's called like

605
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,360
the Golden Nail syndrome or something if

606
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,740
all you have is the hammer then

607
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,080
everything's a nail

608
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,820
and there's definitely attention there

609
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,860
because it's like

610
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,899
how much of what you can do are you

611
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:47,279
supposed to do

612
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,679
something that you can't do

613
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,260
or but then at least you could do what

614
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,700
you needed to do to get there so that's

615
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,960
actually within your scope of what you

616
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,760
can do so it's not that there are things

617
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,460
that you can't do that you can't do

618
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,140
if just from a measurement first

619
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,880
membership

620
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,799
so like

621
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,380
how does it look or how do we recognize

622
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,179
across systems

623
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,179
or how do we have awareness in

624
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,600
situations as limited individuals

625
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,419
who do have all of these

626
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,760
cognitive phenomena

627
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,059
how to make decisions or sense making or

628
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,039
infrastructure or whatever it is the

629
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,179
social

630
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,940
Ness the the system of interest of the

631
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,779
social sciences make that and then dot

632
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,220
dot dot normatively what

633
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,779
I think it's the sun protection built

634
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,720
into into uh

635
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,000
the problem of confirmation bias because

636
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,700
all knowledge generation is happening in

637
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,860
in a in an open system

638
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,799
and so there's always going to be an

639
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,720
agent outside of your

640
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,779
your own mind and it's and what it's

641
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,200
perceiving that that can then challenge

642
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,539
or add to the

643
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,419
you know like the the the super the the

644
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,520
LK 99

645
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,419
um

646
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,179
uh

647
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,200
semiconductors that have there's been

648
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,260
all the rage recently and and how

649
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,740
um at the scientists have now kind of

650
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,679
um discredited it uh quite convincingly

651
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,200
and it's because of this open they might

652
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,659
have had degrees of confirmation bias

653
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,940
that they were egging each other on but

654
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,980
it's it's ultimately been refuted which

655
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,899
is uh

656
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,720
this built-in kind of protection because

657
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,779
it's all operating in a in a in an open

658
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,140
system fortunately

659
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,480
yeah a lot to see there uh Monday

660
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,120
morning reviewer touring

661
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,000
how how do we again go from

662
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,480
any given description of a communicative

663
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,860
event

664
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,100
like the kind of specific unfolding of

665
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,220
the LK 99 narrative

666
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,980
as yet uncompleted

667
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,200
in in the minds of sum which is real

668
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,980
enough

669
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,899
to be real socially

670
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,360
and uh so how do we go from any

671
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,000
descriptive anything about that

672
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,980
total observation

673
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,700
to core screening

674
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,279
then

675
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,960
how do we

676
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,659
come to uh work with that interface with

677
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:38,480
what whatever that is hands that to us

678
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,779
what is the social behavior

679
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,899
what are some some classic

680
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,960
or some novel

681
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
social behaviors

682
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,480
maybe ones that seem pretty obvious

683
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,020
due to recency bias

684
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,600
I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew

685
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
and I have also talked about is the auto

686
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,899
poetic nature of Information Systems

687
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,419
Andrew do you have any thought on this

688
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:38,880
or about where Auto places comes into

689
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,640
like social sciences or these kinds of

690
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,059
models

691
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,960
they're genuine Andrew just left a note

692
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,820
that he's uh okay okay

693
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,279
we just wasn't looking at the time funny

694
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,620
stuff anyone else have a thought on that

695
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,720
okay just just to kind of carry it

696
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,940
forward then basically the the ability

697
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,699
of social systems that include

698
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,460
written Niche modification cumulative

699
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,399
culture

700
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,500
they're increasing

701
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,780
extent of control

702
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,940
as discussed earlier that that

703
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,760
definitely is a bit of a overloaded or

704
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,159
at least doubly meant term in different

705
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,679
settings because it can just simply mean

706
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,139
modeling it with control theory which is

707
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,119
pretty limited philosophical statements

708
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,580
relative to any statistical method or

709
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,960
control like

710
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,960
the kind that people are unhappy with

711
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,540
and the kind that's described in

712
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,219
thinking like a state

713
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,099
and a lot of other works that I know Mao

714
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,619
and Lorena and aval are going to be

715
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,800
definitely going into more

716
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,540
uh detail

717
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,339
on so when societies can model

718
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:03,180
and introspect or or self-reflect

719
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,820
formally

720
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,780
much better

721
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,180
and that can happen through

722
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,820
anything from

723
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,960
free and open source Federated protocols

724
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,839
there's many limited formats

725
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,960
of self-meaning making but cryptography

726
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,420
definitely allows those Explorations and

727
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,800
that doesn't necessarily mean computer

728
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,720
cryptography that could also be like

729
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,640
linguistic encoding

730
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,300
and all these other ways of of niche

731
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,460
sub differentiation

732
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,099
in multi-scale systems

733
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:48,500
you just did not see a system that is

734
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,700
cookie cutter

735
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,260
it's very rare in ecosystems

736
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,420
there's algal blooms and things like

737
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,640
that

738
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,180
so when we really think about the

739
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,800
Developmental and the cognitive and the

740
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,420
selective niche

741
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,900
which is a concept that Axel constant

742
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,060
and others have differentiated in some

743
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,920
of their like ecological octave

744
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,300
inference work

745
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,200
like that Niche is very embodied

746
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,980
extended and cultured etc etc

747
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,619
it's just like a kind of cool direct way

748
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,760
to

749
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,180
open up to that challenge of modeling

750
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,319
and just

751
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,680
bring some

752
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,359
closures

753
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,980
with different accounts or

754
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,160
compatibilities with different accounts

755
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,460
so like all just to give one random

756
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,780
example but maybe it'd be interesting

757
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,420
what what other people think

758
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,839
all the Expressions that people make in

759
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,880
Social settings

760
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,220
can just simply be their expressions or

761
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,500
modeled as such

762
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,440
that is

763
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,320
in one way implicitly

764
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,099
what was always in play

765
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,000
but now

766
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,460
it's describable and legible

767
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,700
and autonomous so

768
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,619
how do we take this active inference

769
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,140
Collective Behavior

770
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,900
crossover and think about what it really

771
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,940
means

772
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,560
in how we're going to be like thinking

773
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,540
differently even just this discussion

774
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,640
forward or like more locally are our

775
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,260
understandings with Collective Behavior

776
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,640
or with behavior

777
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
um

778
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,680
Daniel can you ask the the question

779
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,099
again I I didn't actually catch the

780
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,800
um how do we the quiz start how do we

781
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
start to adapt

782
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,680
some of these General comments

783
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,160
or or frames that are in some ways

784
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,740
disconnected from descriptions of real

785
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,300
systems

786
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,060
how do we think about that

787
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,520
and and what it means

788
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,619
now

789
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,040
what is on the

790
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,500
yeah good that's okay

791
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,320
uh do you mean on the document in front

792
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,500
of us or these these these disconnected

793
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,480
things in front of us that on on the on

794
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,960
the document

795
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,280
I don't know whatever you think or

796
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,000
whatever you want to say

797
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,060
okay

798
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,960
yeah I I think there's a lot uh and I

799
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,119
again I hope I'm not

800
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,740
uh

801
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,660
you know and fully understanding the

802
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,480
question I hope I'm not steering away uh

803
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,880
too much but I gotta had a general sense

804
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,800
of what I think you were saying and

805
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,680
I think it's an enormous uh problem with

806
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,839
the amount of

807
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,839
um information sharing

808
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,960
um just in a in a with let's just take

809
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,180
uh the general uh generative models of

810
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,940
um social media and all of the platforms

811
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,060
that are available to us how much

812
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,599
information we are privy to in any given

813
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,940
uh moments

814
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,980
um

815
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,300
and

816
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,260
I'm kind of forgetting the question that

817
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,780
I that you asked um but but how do you

818
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,720
it's almost as if there is such a

819
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,780
a high rate of information and data flow

820
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,119
that it's really hard to know what to do

821
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,180
with all of it and

822
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,040
and at least as a human being I'm not

823
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,740
saying for machines but um

824
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,380
but uh as a psychologist I'm certainly

825
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,839
interested in

826
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,380
how humans are able to tolerate and

827
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,240
respond to

828
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,359
um

829
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,700
the amount and rate of information

830
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,839
that's all okay

831
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,099
this is not the first time this happens

832
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,820
right like we went from talking to

833
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,099
writing information

834
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,359
then everyone wrote their information

835
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,020
and then we have books and then we have

836
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,900
libraries and that's all available and

837
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,119
again we have access if you can read

838
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,880
right to all the information in the

839
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,960
world so

840
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,780
we adapted to

841
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,240
I don't know to get careers so we could

842
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,119
specify in

843
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,680
which type of information you are going

844
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,920
to know more so maybe we need some sort

845
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,820
of new

846
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,740
career types I don't know more

847
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,359
specifications

848
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,060
with more information

849
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,099
not uh is the rate of information

850
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,359
flowing increases and not is it not

851
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,540
exponential is it not uh

852
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,280
um I know it's it's a crazy amount that

853
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,079
our brains cannot do anything about it

854
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,540
so we have to do multi-disciplinary

855
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,760
things and work together with others if

856
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,920
we want to make something

857
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,260
but

858
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,480
yeah I don't know maybe we will die of

859
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,260
excess of information

860
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,839
how did people feel like active

861
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,820
inference bring something to the

862
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,150
discussion relative to

863
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,300
[Music]

864
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,339
how they want to work towards

865
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,140
ants yeah well isn't that the

866
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,660
provocative question too

867
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,940
but like any system that's that that's

868
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,160
the question everyone is gonna have

869
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,140
their own memes and themes and and

870
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,720
systems that they have spent time with

871
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,460
and did field work with and all this

872
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,920
other like particularity

873
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,540
because a system that doesn't have

874
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,720
particularity is just not going to be

875
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,900
hosting a broad enough Niche for for

876
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,000
phenotypic diversity

877
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,480
uh it's just riding on the edge of a

878
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,380
razor instead of more like a fabric that

879
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,300
continues to unfold I think

880
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,700
there's a lot of work to do with the

881
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,319
social sciences and active inference

882
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,260
just from what I was like reading

883
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,300
trying to find things for this

884
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,319
um discussion

885
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,319
and just I personally wondered what is

886
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,680
is Meaningful or interesting

887
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,040
or useful what's epistemic and pragmatic

888
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,200
value for difference

889
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,560
audiences How does it go from kind of

890
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,980
bringing citations that were not linked

891
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,079
together

892
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,460
in

893
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,900
some

894
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,880
more theoretical or more generative

895
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,579
model oriented work in active inference

896
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:33,960
like epistemic foraging or the infra

897
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,400
ants model

898
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,780
or

899
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,060
any other kind of specific model what

900
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,420
are these different kinds of scientific

901
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,780
artifacts do

902
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,619
for who

903
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,140
I guess I'm still learning very

904
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,060
uh

905
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,980
very

906
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,359
uh

907
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,359
kind of crude be cuddling along here

908
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,980
Daniel with to try and answer that

909
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,619
because it's I've quickly realized that

910
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,000
the field is it's so

911
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,680
it has so much

912
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,720
um the the free energy principle uh the

913
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,359
Bayesian brain

914
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:35,099
even just to psychology has so much

915
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,980
applicability and everyone's seen

916
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,040
everyone I meet at these discussions is

917
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,220
coming at it from a different angle

918
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,480
um and it can be a bit confusing to hear

919
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,740
how other people

920
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,099
uh are applying it to how other people

921
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:54,660
are

922
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,819
um making use of it

923
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:59,579
um in all manner of ways and so I'm

924
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:03,240
still learning how to apply

925
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,400
um to kind of ring fence the free energy

926
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,060
principle and connect it to uh

927
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,920
psychological processes including

928
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,500
Collective behavior and because there's

929
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,200
a lot of Psychopathology in group think

930
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,140
in in Collective Behavior but I'm also

931
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,599
very very interested in its application

932
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,720
at the interface of

933
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,900
um what happens between a a therapist

934
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,460
and a patient

935
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,540
and and I'm often unlike other

936
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,319
um professions who seem who are just by

937
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:40,619
nature of the scientific method

938
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,839
um are able to extract

939
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:46,560
a lot more data to work with to analyze

940
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,700
to um uh um

941
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,339
you know um in a

942
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,560
that's very hard to do I feel very

943
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,579
limited

944
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:57,960
um other than just making kind of

945
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,760
theoretical leaps and inferences about

946
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,500
how to apply

947
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,319
um uh the free energy principle to

948
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,579
psychology

949
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:06,240
um

950
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,619
uh it's I can't have a session with my

951
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,859
brain hooked up to an fmri machine to

952
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:17,220
get data and to see uh when a patient

953
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,859
says

954
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:21,780
that's a spike on the the spike trains

955
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,540
which represents um you know surprisal

956
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,579
and we can then solve for that in some

957
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,920
way I'm I don't have access to that sort

958
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,579
of data flow so it feels limited but I'm

959
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,640
still learning how to apply it

960
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,599
um

961
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,460
yeah and trying to collaborate with

962
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,160
colleagues on that the influence group

963
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
what are people wondering about

964
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,700
Collective Behavior

965
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,560
even if we're totally of course not

966
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,660
going to address it but just what what

967
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,279
are the kinds of things that people

968
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,339
what makes you look up Collective

969
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:12,839
Behavior

970
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,359
instead of just Behavior or individual

971
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,900
Behavior

972
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
foreign

973
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:32,480
safety and need to belong

974
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,799
for me it's um

975
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,640
I think that um

976
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,640
it depends for where you come from and

977
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,760
the country you are but there are places

978
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,339
that are more Collective and there are

979
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,140
places that are more individualistic and

980
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,319
I think mostly non-western countries

981
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:57,599
have a lot of collective Behavior or

982
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,980
knowledge and

983
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,220
periods already right that they already

984
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,520
knew these things that we think are new

985
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,300
for us right how the

986
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,040
Collective thing works for example I

987
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,780
don't know you don't make a decision for

988
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,119
yourself you make a decision for the

989
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,280
group like marrying you marry because

990
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,040
you want an audition you want to

991
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,040
interact with someone or other group and

992
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,740
that's something that affects the the

993
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,140
collective not just you so arrange

994
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,480
marriage makes sense something like that

995
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,480
right so for me making that decision

996
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,760
about individual Collective comes from

997
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,280
understanding that I don't know there

998
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,500
are other places that are already ahead

999
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,839
in what Collective means in terms of

1000
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,560
human beings and how to interact

1001
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,240
and the Western Wall we have all these

1002
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,579
individualistic thing which is very

1003
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:53,880
interesting because why do we have the

1004
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,579
same species and then we have very

1005
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,260
different approaches of how to

1006
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,020
understand ourselves in terms of what an

1007
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,180
individual is and why it matters

1008
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,339
yes there's so much loaded

1009
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,680
on different understandings among people

1010
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,800
including even the the essence of the

1011
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,700
social

1012
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,000
which is who are people and what is the

1013
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,359
the

1014
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,180
obligation and how do we view that that

1015
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,460
relationship

1016
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,500
that's a very

1017
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,380
very deep area and and again the part

1018
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,760
that just kept returning to me in the

1019
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,500
lecture and when I was trying to think

1020
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,339
about how to how to even reflect part of

1021
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,220
uh this very large area

1022
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,940
is like what is the adjective doing

1023
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,760
and what what is what's the reference

1024
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,280
point by which this is being said

1025
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,819
in the speech acts like people often

1026
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:05,640
will dismiss I don't mean to

1027
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,819
um you know straw people but dismiss

1028
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,220
Collective Behavior by saying well we

1029
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,079
are explaining individual Behavior

1030
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:14,880
what are you explaining Beyond The Nest

1031
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,500
mates in The Colony

1032
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,520
and then the exterior like that is it

1033
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,180
and so that can feel like to looking at

1034
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,700
the same thing from two different sides

1035
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,559
and there are different methods like

1036
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,079
some methods blur over individuals a lot

1037
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,220
more

1038
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,160
like statistical methods or that might

1039
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,920
correspond to demographics and then on

1040
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,480
the other hand like more agent-based

1041
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,900
models

1042
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,000
but how much

1043
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,599
variability in what shared variability

1044
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,980
and why General synchranies

1045
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,660
amongst different Quantum reference

1046
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,900
frames all these nested

1047
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,079
if these possibilities

1048
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:02,460
that

1049
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,680
are are grounded in wanting to explore

1050
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,359
mathematical and scientific

1051
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,760
possibilities

1052
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,559
as as the literature of linear

1053
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,819
regression is full of so many incredible

1054
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:17,460
extensions and and and similar

1055
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,160
and then that's

1056
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,040
I I think what the course is

1057
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,559
even beginning to

1058
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,859
to try to express and what I understand

1059
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:32,099
in the works of the other teachers like

1060
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,660
a lot of your backgrounds and and

1061
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,160
everything like that

1062
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,619
is

1063
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,980
where is that

1064
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,240
moment where it is not only science

1065
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,500
because science is not simply the social

1066
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,800
so science has an activity and then as

1067
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,420
there's a diffusion away from science

1068
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,099
and I think that or or at least that

1069
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:01,319
relationship between social and science

1070
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:04,619
is right there in the title maybe that's

1071
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,200
kind of like a science Majors take but

1072
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,740
it but it is itself in a way

1073
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,359
a um

1074
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,059
presenting a dilemma

1075
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,700
with what science means there and then

1076
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,280
that's the frame game who's doing social

1077
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,079
science who's doing not social science

1078
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,480
and that's that's where

1079
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,740
um in in the culture here I'm sitting in

1080
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,440
slash in the technical side of that it

1081
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,960
is related to statistics and formality

1082
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,920
it's the xkcd comic

1083
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,680
and the way that formalisms and and

1084
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,300
details

1085
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,240
are taken as

1086
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,099
under some

1087
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:51,660
regimes of attention basically

1088
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,880
definitive

1089
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,180
and yet there's like a yearning and a

1090
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,920
counterbalancing that's expressed also

1091
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,140
in many ways

1092
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,300
and so that's

1093
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,819
and science maybe some people feel like

1094
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:07,680
certain social scientific methods that's

1095
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,839
like not far enough in this Dimension

1096
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,220
and then the others feel like they're

1097
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,559
too far in this direction

1098
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:14,940
but it's like

1099
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,579
just like any uh like that academic

1100
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:20,220
field let alone any other community of

1101
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,140
diverse agents like of course there's

1102
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,020
going to be distributions

1103
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,240
of perspectives at different times

1104
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,480
by those different perspectives and you

1105
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,559
know

1106
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,700
yeah

1107
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,960
Daniel could do you think uh

1108
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,680
these first principles

1109
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:47,099
would be able to explain why an ant

1110
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:51,119
colony exists uh I know that was your

1111
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,940
um kind of area of interest of study uh

1112
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,660
why an ant colony exists uh in in the

1113
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,059
way that it is executive operating as a

1114
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:03,119
collective and why

1115
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,440
um another

1116
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,720
um animal is able to survive and achieve

1117
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,700
its goals

1118
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,400
uh

1119
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,400
as an individual uh only relying on the

1120
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,960
environment and its actions and

1121
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,839
Sensations to get its needs met into no

1122
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,480
doubt minimize its um free energy but

1123
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,220
could first principles

1124
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:30,059
explain why the one has to survive as a

1125
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:31,740
group and the other has to survive or is

1126
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,359
able to survive

1127
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,980
um under different conditions

1128
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,260
yeah that's a super interesting question

1129
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,200
it's it's very core to this individual

1130
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,540
individuation

1131
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,800
and multi-scale individuation concept

1132
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,839
like is the nest made the individual and

1133
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,000
then the colony is the social because

1134
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,460
then for sure it's super collaborative

1135
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,520
or is the colony of the organism and

1136
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,099
massmates are tissues and then are they

1137
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,800
social across Colony boundaries not

1138
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,260
where I was in Arizona but they're often

1139
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,579
friendly across different species and

1140
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,020
they avoided conflict more often than

1141
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,079
not so it's like what and then go why

1142
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,359
does it even matter what's happening on

1143
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,940
this plot of lands

1144
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,700
in this in this area from like a

1145
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,740
biomimicry perspective

1146
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,859
we might learn new algorithms it's a

1147
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:28,740
Sandbox for learning new techniques and

1148
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,240
observation all these other like

1149
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,359
richnesses so it's to say that like what

1150
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,540
comes away from that science

1151
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,740
that makes it social science

1152
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,420
and I think there's a lot of

1153
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,160
disciplinary ways of understanding that

1154
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,380
which which I'm definitely not expert in

1155
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,500
in the um professional Fields like like

1156
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,599
counseling

1157
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,839
um but probably in in all the different

1158
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,240
Humanities and histories and all these

1159
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,520
other fields

1160
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,880
all these different Maps

1161
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,440
the kind of social

1162
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,380
um

1163
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,040
the epistemic organizing question

1164
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,579
and then the social organizing question

1165
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:17,160
yeah and and the way like Technologies

1166
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,440
also in that tangle

1167
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,180
and yeah someone pointed out like this

1168
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,940
is not a new problem

1169
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,880
and uh but then it's like well what

1170
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,920
parts are new and then what's our model

1171
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,839
by which we're saying that it's like new

1172
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:32,520
or too individualist or too Collective

1173
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,140
on what scale

1174
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,160
what if they're like really

1175
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,660
collectivists at this scale but not at

1176
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,400
this scale

1177
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,280
or another an example of an ambiguous

1178
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,640
or at least like um

1179
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,359
polysomis

1180
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,640
phenotype of colonies is in some

1181
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,559
colonies there's partial reproductive

1182
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,599
activation of like non-reproductive

1183
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,640
Mass mates

1184
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,160
and that has often been modeled from

1185
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,980
like a position of like zero is the law

1186
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,339
and how are they cheating above this but

1187
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:07,680
it's also been approached from a colony

1188
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,540
level

1189
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,040
strategic bed hedging

1190
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,400
so without super deep knowledge of

1191
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,339
really some of the specifics of the

1192
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,440
regularities that that Colony algorithm

1193
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,940
had to persist

1194
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,079
for so long and to have gotten swept off

1195
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,460
the table if it was even it's like

1196
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,579
that's that's a very integrated problem

1197
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:32,099
so it helps you approach Collective

1198
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:33,900
systems and and learn about them but

1199
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,800
it's like

1200
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,140
there's a lot to say about humidity loss

1201
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,680
in foraging and humidity loss isn't even

1202
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,020
the whole picture

1203
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,299
and human foraging is a lot more

1204
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:46,799
sophisticated

1205
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,700
from just like a perception cognition

1206
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,240
influence perspective

1207
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,740
so

1208
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,500
those are just some ant related thoughts

1209
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,480
but it just centers a lot of discussions

1210
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,740
that really matter

1211
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,299
and I think the really interesting piece

1212
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:06,000
is not always in the way

1213
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,339
that they're thought to by some

1214
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,460
yeah and it's and it's very hard to get

1215
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,920
any kind of

1216
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,599
cross-pollination with OTC caused

1217
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:21,140
pollination

1218
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,480
studying One agent it's it's quite for

1219
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,160
at least in my mind very difficult to

1220
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,780
kind of generalize things across

1221
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,540
different agents um it starts getting a

1222
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,579
bit

1223
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:33,839
uh

1224
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,319
yeah tricky to infer

1225
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,700
one collector's uh

1226
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,740
what how and why and how they survive

1227
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,700
and how another agent does It's Tricky

1228
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,819
so I I'm almost

1229
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,140
human beings as hard as they are to

1230
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,020
study and just try and run with it as

1231
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,220
far as possible

1232
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,500
yeah

1233
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,140
otherwise it's just

1234
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,460
information overload

1235
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,180
body is a complex place too

1236
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:20,099
and digital technology virtuality

1237
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,260
these are such

1238
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,299
um richly developed topics in the social

1239
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:26,280
sciences I only know the tiniest amount

1240
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,599
from

1241
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,359
but I think that through

1242
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,599
participation and inclusion in

1243
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,059
collaboration and in conversations and

1244
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,619
everything

1245
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:39,660
there's going to be a lot of interesting

1246
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,400
connections

1247
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,940
and paths

1248
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,020
um

1249
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,980
and

1250
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:51,599
it's being approached seemingly a

1251
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,839
multiple layers like within the the two

1252
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,460
layers that just we can focus most

1253
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,740
narrowly on is like within the realm of

1254
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,760
science

1255
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,859
what is science

1256
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:04,980
which is kind of like playing this other

1257
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,660
um role with inertia

1258
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,700
in some people's minds and in systems

1259
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,200
what is science who gets to decide what

1260
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,940
social science is I don't know I'm not

1261
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,319
in social science

1262
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,260
but it's system of interest to society

1263
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,420
and certainly I'm a part of that

1264
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,319
um so it's like what is the what is good

1265
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,760
technically

1266
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,880
what is social scientific

1267
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,059
and then what is that social scientific

1268
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:32,819
how does that gonna interface into the

1269
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:35,700
the metaphysical questions and and the

1270
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,859
normative ethical

1271
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:40,859
and uh um decision making with

1272
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:43,440
trade-offs and the real reflexive

1273
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,819
complex decisions that matter

1274
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:51,200
also while recognizing this increasingly

1275
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,780
nuanced way of thinking about different

1276
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,099
social intelligences

1277
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,880
what's any other random thought or

1278
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,220
curiosity about Collective Behavior

1279
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,079
one point that I would have added into

1280
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,760
the lecture

1281
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,099
was just that in distributed systems

1282
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:34,740
whether as modeled or as such

1283
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,440
all behavior is arising from

1284
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,099
interactions local to individuals even

1285
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:42,420
if it's sent through some Wireless

1286
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,339
mechanism it's like all about the local

1287
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:45,839
interactions

1288
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,980
and so that is a a an arising type

1289
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,480
process

1290
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,819
that gives the modeler like one

1291
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:55,980
hands-off layer

1292
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,059
at least if not much more another nice

1293
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,400
feature about them

1294
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,059
um they are in a way

1295
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,339
ing to be composed because they

1296
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:11,700
intrinsically contain like at least two

1297
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,220
layers of consideration

1298
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,720
not whether there's kind of like a

1299
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,040
forcing function

1300
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,440
of one layer and just sort of dangling a

1301
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,180
bottom layer or whether there's a lot of

1302
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,920
what we would call emergence or

1303
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,700
discussive in in that way like that more

1304
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,000
a rising function can be modeled but in

1305
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,920
either way then you can kind of wrap

1306
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,200
that two-layer system

1307
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,940
and then compose them

1308
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,980
so that's like what enables in certain

1309
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,559
situations like parallelization

1310
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,420
or at least you know that's obviously a

1311
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,559
big area but that's what allows

1312
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:49,140
multi-agent simulation Frameworks

1313
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,640
to do

1314
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,660
well on certain very challenging

1315
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,700
sense making in action selection

1316
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,480
problems not by guarantee or default

1317
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,599
because any given slicing and dicing of

1318
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,280
any given

1319
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,059
um

1320
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:07,740
prompting of information may not help

1321
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,279
you adapt

1322
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,380
but there are paths that do and don't

1323
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,299
help

1324
01:04:14,299 --> 01:04:17,819
persist or not and that's this kind of

1325
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:19,380
persistence

1326
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,559
starting place that we

1327
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,000
began with Sasha

1328
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,880
um okay I really resonate with what you

1329
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,099
mentioned about the local interactions

1330
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:35,059
that um

1331
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:38,280
even if information is transmitted

1332
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,380
um over long distances

1333
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,619
um then the agents

1334
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:46,920
behave in a way that is locally relevant

1335
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,740
and integrates that information

1336
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,180
and it actually makes me think a lot

1337
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,819
about the like psychology

1338
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:57,960
um therapy angle that um while you uh

1339
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,200
try to get information about uh the

1340
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,700
person's like

1341
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,440
um sort of local environment and

1342
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,560
behavior

1343
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:05,819
[Music]

1344
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:06,720
um

1345
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,000
or like perhaps you know demographics

1346
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,799
and age that um they're informational

1347
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,900
environment like a wealth of what kind

1348
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,839
of um information they consume might

1349
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:23,400
also be really telling about their

1350
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,500
uh

1351
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,780
psychological and like

1352
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,420
Behavior Uh in interactions or

1353
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,880
pathologies

1354
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,280
um

1355
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,660
and then to bring it kind of Full Circle

1356
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,920

01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,440
they are particip studying

1359
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,559
um

1360
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:53,099
yeah I I think it's just um

1361
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,740
such a difference in perspective to see

1362
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,859
that as like a positive and a gift that

1363
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:01,559
um the way that you would design and run

1364
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:03,900
an experiment today is not the way that

1365
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,940
you would do it two years from now with

1366
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,579
more experience and so

1367
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:10,799
um that is a

1368
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,220
a a benefit and like a bonus in the

1369
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,680
system and not um like a negative

1370
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,200
perspective of of bias that it's

1371
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:24,240
detracting from some underlying uh truth

1372
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,959
or reality

1373
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,618
so just a few thoughts

1374
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,200
oh very interesting anyone wanna

1375
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,980
add something

1376
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,740
I think we didn't fully resolve this

1377
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:49,200
early question about the umbelt

1378
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,900
um term from ethology behavioral

1379
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,960
research observation science

1380
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,720
using the term to describe the world as

1381
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,099
it's experienced by a particular

1382
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,720
organism

1383
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,640
I think a few different pieces and

1384
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,200
there's a lot of discussion and

1385
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,940
discourse so just this is just even like

1386
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,780
a super short overview the world we

1387
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,059
might connect to World modeling

1388
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,160
and there's a lot of interesting work in

1389
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,280
all kinds of different like pros focus

1390
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,760
on qualitative systems as well as some

1391
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,859
artificial or synthetic intelligence

1392
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:26,460
World modeling as it experienced as it

1393
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,920
is experienced is one of the sticky and

1394
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,980
deep ones because this is the area of

1395
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,500
phenomenology and so this is like

1396
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,859
a kind of semi-eternal discussion point

1397
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:40,440
so whether whether active inference

1398
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,020
delivers on world modeling is kind of

1399
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,420
empirical and just plain

1400
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,059
whereas as it is experienced is going to

1401
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:50,520
be a philosophical question

1402
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,980
and then by a particular organism that

1403
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,799
specificity we get by actually making

1404
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:57,599
the generative model

1405
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,900
even if we're just speculating about it

1406
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,520
it's like talking about experience

1407
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,039
without an experiencer

1408
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,099
would be like talk talking about um

1409
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:10,619
some agent's Behavior without reference

1410
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:14,339
to its niche

1411
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,020
and then where there is like that

1412
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,960
complex negotiation

1413
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,759
I think the humanities and a lot of the

1414
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,279
social sciences have identified

1415
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,620
a lot of the

1416
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,560
structural like top-down and also the

1417
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,819
personal

1418
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,060
bottom up

1419
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:36,920
motifs of of things being

1420
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,560
blurred and made complex

1421
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,259
and so I think part of the social and

1422
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:45,420
the scientific as coming only from the

1423
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,100
scientific side

1424
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,319
um is like to to

1425
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:53,100
meet in the third space and or at least

1426
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,698
make it work to have a mutual compromise

1427
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:59,219
where it's like

1428
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,339
certain social science social oriented

1429
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,560
claims based upon this scientific

1430
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,839
measure that is going to be a judgment

1431
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:07,738
call

1432
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:09,779
but understanding that conversation

1433
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,179
where is it a mutual compromise in like

1434
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:15,120
what dimensions not simply along the

1435
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,339
kind of like rigor accessibility or

1436
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:18,960
implications access there's just very

1437
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,620
many things in play in these iterated

1438
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,219
relationships in ecosystems

1439
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,080
foreign

1440
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:39,179
having a researcher as part of the

1441
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:40,439
ecosystem

1442
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:42,719
well what is it here's here's the

1443
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,120
forager question you see the nest made

1444
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,920
on the ground it's a forger but then we

1445
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,420
step back it's like okay well it's

1446
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,040
foraging

1447
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,259
and then that's the allocation of the

1448
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,440
forager then its foraging is still

1449
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,900
part of this sense making this

1450
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,400
generative sense making with like

1451
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,920
process understanding

1452
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,860
even of a Trace which is something that

1453
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,900
Bruno LaTour and others have have

1454
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,600
explored with like following a trace in

1455
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,060
a social setting and using that to to

1456
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,640
trace Networks

1457
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,219
so in our digital ecosystems though our

1458
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:19,679
information ecosystems

1459
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,860
is not research happening

1460
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,020
and so what what does that really mean

1461
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,360
and then what are those social

1462
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,860
normativities

1463
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,900
there's going to be like a meeting or a

1464
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,199
handoff with with where that really is

1465
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:36,980
happening

1466
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,600
or maybe it's a knocking on the door

1467
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,380
that's ignores

1468
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:44,520
or

1469
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,640
it could be whatever metaphor in that

1470
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,739
setting it actually is

1471
01:10:49,739 --> 01:10:51,540
there's no General metaphor because I'd

1472
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,980
be like oh what's the general metaphor

1473
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,699
on this experiment which experiment

1474
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:59,280
just the general action that we plan to

1475
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,820
take oh

1476
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,880
hard to say

1477
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,060
okay well in our last like connections I

1478
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,080
guess

1479
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,000
if anybody types a question live chat

1480
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,040
we'll look at it otherwise what are any

1481
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,060
other thoughts or like

1482
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,540
what what

1483
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:50,159
can we learn more about about Collective

1484
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,300
Behavior

1485
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,640
or what will it mean for our sense

1486
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,260
making decision making if we understand

1487
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,640
Collective Behavior better

1488
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,980
what else are people excited about for

1489
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,000
the rest of the course

1490
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,659
like based upon the sections that we've

1491
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:15,320
done so far

1492
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:18,840
and and how how we can

1493
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,020
even even start to approach this in in

1494
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,199
an acknowledged Limited

1495
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,219
finite way

1496
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,120
yeah Sasha then than anyone else

1497
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,480
just added a question to the very bottom

1498
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,679
of the notes

1499
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,260
um and it makes me think about

1500
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,080
um how working on this document

1501
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,540
collaboratively throughout the last hour

1502
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,719
um we're able to uh kind of leave a

1503
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,120
stigmergic trace of things we've

1504
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,659
discussed and what sort of traits or

1505
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:56,900
practices should

1506
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,760
individual humans I guess I should

1507
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,400
specify humans should we embody in order

1508
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,860
to improve cohesion

1509
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,080
um in Collective Behavior

1510
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,980
it makes me think of certain psychology

1511
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,020
um

1512
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,420
traits or uh descriptions of like

1513
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,040
openness

1514
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,640
um or conscientiousness

1515
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,040
um what will make

1516
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,500
individual humans

1517
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,219
um

1518
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,800
better participants in

1519
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,940
Collective Behavior

1520
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,860
yeah I I think to to add to that

1521
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,940
um

1522
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,219
to just emphasize the importance again

1523
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:45,780
only with

1524
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,900
um human agents

1525
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,360
um specifically if you have the capacity

1526
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,080
to think and reflect and

1527
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,140
the only ones that have that those uh

1528
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:01,080
really Advanced capabilities that we

1529
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,480
know of as yet but to really kind of

1530
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,100
Leverage

1531
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,239
um

1532
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,699
in order to make the collective better

1533
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:12,120
it is a responsibility on of the

1534
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,620
individual

1535
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,420
despite being

1536
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,520
part of a collective and on in many

1537
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,260
different on many different fronts to be

1538
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,000
able to leverage and utilize their own

1539
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,659
internal

1540
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:27,360
States and what they have learned and to

1541
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,100
be able to think

1542
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,540
in a

1543
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:33,179
to retain the individual the

1544
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,760
individual's mind and think about the

1545
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,780
collective

1546
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,540
I think is so important it's the

1547
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:42,000
collective is to

1548
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,719
um

1549
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,300
become healthier essentially to your

1550
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,800
point and to improve its

1551
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,739
yeah to become more

1552
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,380
conscientious to become more

1553
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,719
responsible or whatever that might be

1554
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:08,480
so to always try and maintain a thinking

1555
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,800
um

1556
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,980
self is crucial

1557
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,440
unless you can very easily be usurped

1558
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,280
into the collective as it's

1559
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,280
if you just go on any social media media

1560
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,420
platform you will see

1561
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,600
individuals rarely thinking

1562
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,179
from themselves and seemingly kind of

1563
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:35,580
just fueling each other and that that

1564
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,620
causes massive problems

1565
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,739
so an individual mind is strikes me as

1566
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:42,840
being just the most important thing in

1567
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,280
the future going forward

1568
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,760
foreign

1569
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,179
with individuation and collectivization

1570
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:58,860
as these like ongoing

1571
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:02,340
negotiated compromises that can be also

1572
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,900
viewed many ways however however they

1573
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,400
are

1574
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,580
um

1575
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,219
cognitive science coming into play

1576
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,219
maybe uh historical processes

1577
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,540
or

1578
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,960
philosophies

1579
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,500
were

1580
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,000
um

1581
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,739
used in many settings for

1582
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,780
even approaching these kinds of social

1583
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,760
questions

1584
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,100
and now with computer science and

1585
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,020
technology

1586
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,140
it even like is a discussion more about

1587
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,300
the capacities

1588
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,420
of measurement and action

1589
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,460
not that those are new in and of

1590
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,380
themselves like but thinking like a

1591
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,880
state like the development of the

1592
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,380
apparatus

1593
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,540
the development of the social social

1594
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,900
systems that can be run on on Open

1595
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,460
Source Hardware open source software

1596
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,239
things like that

1597
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:08,159
so

1598
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,679
I I don't know if something's

1599
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,100
generalized across all such groups

1600
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,580
but

1601
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,860
understanding what environments

1602
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,840
at least initially things aren't

1603
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,620
beginning at

1604
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,159
is just a realist starting point

1605
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:31,560
probably no guarantee since most things

1606
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,860
slash all things are swept off the table

1607
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:38,580
in their specifics anyway

1608
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,300
so

1609
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,679
and how to deal with that kind of like

1610
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,560
skin on the line

1611
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,560
type of decision making is very

1612
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,659
interesting how it's pursued in the in

1613
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:54,179
the Sciences

1614
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:56,159
because often like many runs are

1615
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,500
presented or that kind of like like

1616
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,719
catastrophic failure mode of models is

1617
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,400
is not considered just like part of the

1618
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,920
training starting naive

1619
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,060
um

1620
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,699
so just the way the different social

1621
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:11,280
considerations

1622
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,580
are RR converged upon it's never it's

1623
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,920
not like reduced to one

1624
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,620
feature of the social because the social

1625
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,880
is such an open space

1626
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,520
as a scientist always impressed by how

1627
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,300
that writing could kind of open up

1628
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,280
the um

1629
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,500
situations which are like mundane but

1630
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,540
also of course Very

1631
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:39,000
deep and meaningful

1632
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,140
also though mundane

1633
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:22,140
any other thoughts

1634
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,380
or otherwise uh on on Collective

1635
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,199
Behavior or on the social sciences

1636
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,300
course or anything

1637
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,540
otherwise people can have any lost words

1638
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:36,260
if they want

1639
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,840
yeah awesome thank you all for

1640
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,980
participating

1641
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,360
David want to add anything

1642
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,140
yeah well I look forward to uh more

1643
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,260
questions being asked on the course

1644
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:03,600
website and everybody's um

1645
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,520
engagement with the course is very much

01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,719
appreciated so keep up the collective my

1647
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:11,580
scale learning and it's it's a fun

1648
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,980
course really happy that we could have

1649
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,780
done this session and very happy to have

1650
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,620
concluded the session

1651
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,679
all right thank you bye bye everyone

1652
