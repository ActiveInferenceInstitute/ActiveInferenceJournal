5460	6010	1	A	0.59	You.
8300	9160	2	A	0.99995	Hello and welcome.
9230	11832	3	A	0.99142	It's August 16, 2023.
11966	22170	4	A	0.92846	We're in the collective behavior discussion section of the active inference for the Social sciences course in 2023.
22540	37456	5	A	0.99998	So perhaps let us all go around and give an opening in introduction and or reflection and see who joins and what happens from there.
37558	40530	6	A	0.99959	But just so that everybody has said hello.
48840	49412	7	B	0.99847	Hi, everyone.
49466	53092	8	B	0.99884	I'm Brun 09:00 P.m.
53146	58490	9	B	0.99984	In South Africa, and, yeah, just excited to be and see what happens.
66580	67708	10	C	0.90319	Hi, I'm Andrew.
67804	79184	11	C	0.82415	I'm a graduate student in Indiana, and I guess my field of interest now is knowledge management.
79232	92890	12	C	1.0	And I think that figuring out how we collectively learn and can share information is a really interesting topic, and I'd like to see how this would apply.
97850	115646	13	D	0.40449	Hi, I'm Gina, and I'm from Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain, studying and doing experiments related to this topic and trying to learn a little bit of the theory that's behind it so we can advance better.
115828	116910	14	D	0.65805	I'm excited.
120610	121166	15	E	0.99955	Hello.
121268	122266	16	E	1.0	My name is Sasha.
122298	124282	17	E	0.92185	I'm calling in from California.
124346	126000	18	E	0.96493	I'm also a graduate student.
127190	132562	19	E	0.81614	Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited presentation last week.
132616	134450	20	E	0.54959	I'm looking forward to a discussion.
136310	146790	21	A	0.91	All right, well, how about anyone can give a first reflection on collective behavior?
148170	156154	22	A	0.9334	What was their thought or context before, and where are they at as we kind of begin?
156272	157370	23	A	0.99583	Yeah, Regina.
160830	170718	24	D	0.64	Okay, so I just want to make sure that I understand because I took, like, two big lessons from your lesson, right?
170804	185586	25	D	0.98	And the first one is that this famous model of active inference that has the agent and the environment and the Markov blanket in the middle, right?
185688	187826	26	D	1.0	And just interacts with everything.
187928	188386	27	D	0.972	Right.
188488	209318	28	D	0.99852	So I think what I got from what you discuss, maybe I didn't have a good definition of an agent, but first, that you can have that agent not be just an individual, but also your definition of an individual changes depending on what you want to study in the behavior.
209414	209818	29	D	0.99969	Right.
209904	222174	30	D	0.87032	So an agent can be an ant, it can be an ecosystem, it can be an eye looking at something, or it can be as a society, for example.
222292	234420	31	D	1.0	And I think that's a big take for me because it changes a lot the concept of how to study things and use active imprints just by changing how big the agent can be.
234790	237220	32	D	0.99939	So I don't know if I got that right.
237830	239890	33	D	0.68793	So first, that clarification.
243340	244970	34	A	0.65852	So what is an agent?
249820	254616	35	D	0.94569	Yeah, so I don't know if there's, like, a formal definition of an agent in active inference.
254728	255100	36	D	0.98896	Right.
255170	267148	37	D	0.82633	But if we want to study whatever we want, because I'm about study, because I have to do that's, like, my goal, whatever I'm doing.
267314	274496	38	D	0.99991	So I want to study whatever I have to choose what's going to be my agent and the environment it has.
274678	281270	39	D	0.99999	So choosing the agent, you can do it to create a model or to make an experiment, whatever.
281800	292088	40	D	0.99933	But the choice you make, it will depend on what you understand as an individual or as an agent?
292254	293288	41	D	0.73	I think so.
293374	294010	42	D	0.98057	Right.
305070	305482	43	A	0.99979	Awesome.
305536	307020	44	A	0.99982	Anyone have a thought on that?
308750	313440	45	D	0.99986	If I continue with something, just to add something else, and this will be my mind.
314530	335220	46	D	0.98	And then I'm thinking, is that also a big problem that we have or I think I have, is that since I am part of the environment, you know, the perspective of whoever is studying whatever it is, it's also going to be an effect in it.
335530	347720	47	D	0.99657	So maybe scientists already decided, but I don't know that we can never have an objective way of studying something if you're part of the environment of the agent.
348250	356234	48	D	0.99994	So, I don't know, we already forgot it or we already decided that's it we cannot have objective observations of behavior in general.
356432	365742	49	D	0.94641	But you always think about the agent environment and you studying it as something else, but something else is also affecting it.
365796	378226	50	D	0.91106	So I see that as a problem or maybe something that has to be said, like we are not objective because we're part of what it's affecting our agents in the behavior collectively too.
378408	381540	51	D	0.98865	So those are the thoughts I have to share.
384230	387174	52	B	0.99881	Regina, I'm also new to all of this.
387212	408634	53	B	0.99864	So my preliminary understanding of what is an agent is anything that has any good reason to self evidence and to itself or to survive that doesn't want to dissipate, that might delineate the boundary of what an agent is.
408672	423946	54	B	1.0	That then sets up the boundaries with which it will, as you describe, start interacting with the world, with the environment.
424138	436600	55	B	0.87853	So if something, as I understand it, if something has a reason to go on being to survive, then it is an agent in the world.
439130	442120	56	D	1.0	Okay, but that agent could be anything, right?
443450	444534	57	D	1.0	Is that what you're saying?
444572	444726	58	D	0.9999	Right?
444748	454810	59	D	0.81159	Like, if he wants to survive, can be an ant surviving individually or a cell or a a good that's like a good definition.
458190	458940	60	D	0.16	Okay.
461170	461582	61	A	0.94679	Yeah.
461636	462590	62	A	0.98806	Sasha.
464370	465118	63	E	0.99996	Great points.
465204	467134	64	E	0.99862	Regina, so much to say.
467172	494454	65	E	0.74456	There something that I have experience with as a researcher in biology is deciding the kind of the statistics or sampling approach to use, whether we're taking one cell from one individual or we're taking many cells from many individuals, and how to do the statistics and kind of sampling approach on that.
494652	505210	66	E	0.56822	That is an evergreen question that we're always reevaluating to see how to think about the independencies within biological systems.
507870	515338	67	E	1.0	And then another thing that you mentioned was about the individual being part of the ecosystem.
515434	527650	68	E	1.0	And that makes me think a lot about complexity science and something that is addressed there in thinking about the interplay of the scientists and what they're studying.
529750	531780	69	E	0.77024	Yeah, thank you for those points.
539540	540156	70	B	0.91276	Sasha.
540188	544390	71	B	0.50137	Can sorry, I'm not raising my hand, I'm just unmuting it.
545080	545956	72	B	0.7523	That's okay.
546058	549460	73	B	0.99988	Can you say a bit more about what you mean by complexity science?
562340	563600	74	A	0.59423	Maybe muted?
565240	567190	75	A	0.93	Oh, can't speak at the moment.
570280	571030	76	A	0.98799	Yeah.
571720	578010	77	A	0.99947	Complexity science has looked at agent based modeling as a fundamental tool.
578380	596508	78	A	0.94838	John Holland signals and boundaries, focusing on what from an active inference side, we might say, as like message passing or communication for the messages and then boundaries with the whole discussion around the boundaries in the world.
596594	600040	79	A	0.96476	Map territory, map territory fallacy.
600200	601796	80	A	0.88542	Map territory fallacy.
601848	602800	81	A	0.99055	Fallacy.
604260	606240	82	A	0.99967	Doing iterative modeling.
607060	632040	83	A	0.49057	Sasha brought up limited experimental resources in the scientific setting, and that's kind of analogous to the limited energy budget or attentional budget ultimately, or just decision making budget of the kinds of active entities that make sense to model the ones that kind of have those characteristics.
633980	639640	84	A	0.99995	This is really the question of what makes something first principles or what are the first principles?
640560	647240	85	A	0.97	One aspect of it, as brought up is the censoring of the persistence.
647400	652560	86	A	0.93906	So from the outside, that's kind of like an empiricist's view of persistence, like, is it measurable?
652980	663570	87	A	0.99999	But not saying that something is necessarily that which is the statistical tool, and then the sort of like inside out implementation type.
665160	668820	88	A	0.69872	But there's a lot more to say in that.
668890	677480	89	A	0.77946	Who wants to bring in some new angle or how do they see collective behavior?
677980	680280	90	A	0.74071	Why do we talk about collective behavior?
681740	694380	91	A	0.99995	Why not just behavior, recognize that behavior is multiscale or is social, what's really being communicated with the collective?
704530	711042	92	D	0.76	I believe that we chose those levels so we can make it more simple for our brains to understand it.
711176	720580	93	D	1.0	Because if we talk about collective behavior, actually is the universe behaving and the particles and everything, right?
721190	733740	94	D	0.99963	So I don't know if that's a little bit just based on I don't know what's the word, like, just the material world and how it physically moves and that's like deterministic or whatever, right?
734110	746640	95	D	0.99983	But I think us, we chose to have those limitations so we could understand the world, but also we should acknowledge that our limited because we're part of the system.
748770	768820	96	C	0.93942	I'm having a little trouble on my kind of understanding, I guess, where the schism lies between kind of the Markov blanket and the umwelt in semiotics of the animals sensory experience.
777760	787070	97	C	0.942	Anyone have maybe someone could Daniel, do you know the difference between that two?
788260	789804	98	A	0.99887	Can you be a little louder?
789852	790752	99	A	0.99972	Thank you, though.
790886	791372	100	A	0.99861	Andrew?
791436	792930	101	A	0.99984	Anyone have a thought on that?
794020	797744	102	A	0.99422	I'll bring in a definition of then and then we can see.
797782	799970	103	A	0.96467	But meanwhile, does anyone have a.
802100	802476	104	D	0.79	Sorry.
802518	804704	105	A	0.99	Sorry, I was just muted on zoom.
804752	813290	106	A	0.9965	Andrew, you're a little quiet, but I'm going to bring in a definition of umvelt and then meanwhile, does anyone have a thought?
825820	879636	107	B	0.98	I hope I'm not further diluting Andrew's question, but I think of collective behavior in kind of like, I don't know, a football team or a soccer team and what that provides the group who shares some common ethos and what that does to the how that regulates their collective or individual and collective free energies during a match or throughout the season, and how that gives some charge to some investment.
879748	886876	108	B	1.0	Because it's my team against yours, and we have to try and win.
887058	917270	109	B	1.0	And so without that collective behavior, it might be far harder to achieve a group's goals if they aren't able to collaborate and share implicitly and explicitly certain traits, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals, ideologies, whatever they might be, and how that then allows us to compete in the world.
922220	923768	110	D	1.0	I see what you're saying.
923934	925480	111	D	0.99602	It's brain.
926160	927756	112	B	1.0	Yes, okay.
927858	929310	113	D	1.0	I see what you're saying.
930000	932748	114	D	0.9993	Especially because we're watching the World Cup, right?
932834	934300	115	D	0.9919	Women's World Cup.
935460	935872	116	D	0.41038	Yeah.
935926	937440	117	D	0.97406	So it's very relevant.
938020	947384	118	D	0.79209	But I see that in all the things you've said, it seems that for you, behavior needs to have like a goal.
947532	950596	119	D	0.98	And I don't know if I agree with that.
950618	953460	120	D	0.99046	It's either survival or winning.
954440	964504	121	D	0.52236	But maybe for me, it's just something that happens and maybe the consequence is surviving, but it's not the goal to survive or to win the game.
964702	966888	122	D	0.72	I mean, in the football it is, right?
966974	977340	123	D	0.99998	But in general, maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively, just the thoughts.
978160	979150	124	B	0.66933	It's interesting.
981760	983640	125	A	0.99468	Yeah, a lot of great comments.
983720	1005616	126	A	0.44009	Well, the paper of Connor Hines at all on the collective behavior as surprise minimization that points the way towards using the act infontology these kinds of modeling approaches for collective behavioral situations and really just recognizing them as a certain type of behavioral modeling.
1005728	1026616	127	A	1.0	The simplest case might just be a single closed system, all part of the composition that leads to the ability to describe at very least a lot of different kinds of systems, just like a linear model can describe a lot of systems.
1026648	1048372	128	A	0.99972	So then it's also really interesting a topic that came up in one of the recent textbook groups with what's normative about active inference, because the term of the process theory, even of active inference being normative is mentioned multiple times.
1048426	1053696	129	A	1.0	And that's definitely a topic that connects to the social sciences.
1053888	1081580	130	A	0.77	One can imagine the kind of niche normativity or niche regularities in a broad sense and then the real minute particulars of how they play out, which kind of hints at the kind of descriptive or causal minimum to start making some anything but toy specific generative models.
1085140	1152660	131	A	0.99296	So it's been an interesting theme to see, even already in Abel's and Ben's lectures and discussions this question between description process of describing which is what I associated with Professor Gordon's approach to ant watching how that descriptive process which is what we can say that we have for active inference, just like a linear modeling ecosystem could say about their linear modeling in principle, and how to then articulate the normativities of the framework, if that concept, if that separation can even exist from the behavioral normativities that include the basis of social fabric in all different kinds of communities.
1196170	1197510	132	A	0.67924	Here's another question.
1197580	1218970	133	A	0.99459	So what is the role of any technical detail in the social sciences, whether more on the statistical connecting with data or more category theoretic, like just formal?
1219630	1231790	134	A	0.9998	What's the role of formal methods in different kinds of academic or practical expressions about social systems.
1236850	1244720	135	A	0.98207	Does it matter at all how we think about a framework at all?
1246370	1266200	136	C	0.99998	Well, for formalizing aspects of a social system, I would say that the purpose is for communication between individuals because just we can't verify that.
1267050	1272790	137	C	0.99908	Well, formalizing it is just setting a system on top of what you're observing.
1274190	1283450	138	C	0.96837	But there is no explicit guarantee what you're saying encompasses everything of the phenomena you're observing.
1283950	1284700	139	C	0.99	And.
1288590	1289340	140	B	0.99	Just.
1291550	1298366	141	C	0.99963	Kind of going back to Taoism of the name that can be named is not the true eternal name.
1298548	1306290	142	C	0.62	And so it's just a way of it's a slice of what we can observe.
1306870	1320370	143	C	1.0	And maybe you can make predictions or maybe you can generate something that acts like the phenomena you're observing.
1322790	1333766	144	C	0.99783	It's a way to kind of it's just a way to kind of approximate our understanding of some phenomena.
1333878	1347440	145	C	1.0	And you have to slice it in a specific way, but also understanding that it is a slice or it is a tangent line that you're approximating as opposed to encompassing the whole system from verbalizing it.
1354790	1360786	146	D	0.54	I will add maybe it's not the goal but something that happens out of describing any system.
1360888	1373478	147	D	0.99995	Like Andrew said, it's like the goal to modify it or to corrupt it in some way to gain control or whatever.
1373564	1377894	148	D	0.78557	If you know the model, you know how to play the game, kind of.
1378092	1385178	149	D	0.88169	So you write instructions and try to see if you can outsmart someone else.
1385344	1387626	150	D	1.0	I mean, it sounds kind of dark, right?
1387728	1394570	151	D	1.0	But maybe it's one of the goals too, or something that just happens out of knowing the rules that nobody else knows.
1398550	1409490	152	C	1.0	I guess when you talk about control, there is a shade that can be gained from that specific wording.
1409650	1423798	153	C	0.99998	But control in terms of control theory or that comes from electrical engineering and it's really just what shapes the behavior or what are the inputs that drive the behavior.
1423974	1431842	154	C	1.0	And when you're talking about control, it's really just about well, if you change these inputs, how does that change the end behavior?
1431926	1468486	155	C	0.87	And so you can actually from electrical engineering of control in some sort of electromechanical system, but then you can make analogous statements on control into society which doesn't necessarily mean the dark negative control, but maybe there's some pathological behavior in a society or even pathological pathological responses within the brain and it's like, well, what is driving that?
1468508	1479340	156	C	0.89	And is it possible to change the drivers of that to have something that is more beneficial to the system?
1485800	1504340	157	B	0.83703	Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's saying, because it matters how you manipulate a system or it matters how you affect a brain.
1504500	1505844	158	B	0.98859	So it cannot be random.
1505892	1513848	159	B	0.97	I mean, we've come a long way, for example, from lobotomy, which had disastrous effects.
1513944	1519244	160	B	0.75	And it matters to a system how you affect it.
1519282	1548470	161	B	1.0	And so to know more formally the most effective way to create a desired effect, whatever that might be it's essential that it's not just kind of poking and prodding that is as much as that is part of the scientific method to update that method in accordance with what you're learning is important.
1554010	1555734	162	D	0.53064	No, I think you're both right.
1555772	1557058	163	D	0.8915	It doesn't have to be dark.
1557154	1562370	164	D	0.97615	But also something else that Andrew said about predicting.
1562530	1593220	165	D	0.76	I think that's one of also the big goals trying to predict whether to be prepared it couldn't be to control right, but if you can somehow predict how people respond to this or how a system will behave in this other scenario you can change what the input is or prepare for whatever comes, I guess.
1597710	1600474	166	A	0.65114	Yeah, a lot of great points.
1600592	1625106	167	A	0.99989	Some of the commonly held not equally by everyone, everyone, but some of the tenets of science being to explain predict design and control where explanation and fiction are on the pathway towards systems designing and maintenance and other words that people can add.
1625288	1649626	168	A	0.99997	But that's the pragmatic utility oriented view which doesn't have to be an absolutist view but certainly there are regimes of attention socially now and seemingly for long long times where people were wanting to retain and to constrain the variance distribution on what we would say is their generative model.
1649728	1654114	169	A	0.99816	Some norm and then other times engaging in these functions.
1654262	1675086	170	A	1.0	And that instrumentalist usage of active inference is like we're going to be able to model it with a pretty minimum framework that's commonly used in statistical systems where some things we observe and some we don't, and at least we know and how all the pieces are connected.
1675278	1695130	171	A	1.0	And then that is an artifact in model based design as people develop that line through time socially, just like probably has been always the case for complex projects and scientific collaboration.
1697630	1700300	172	A	0.99811	There's a few other interesting pieces but yeah, please.
1702430	1712042	173	D	0.96194	I'm just wondering if now that I'm thinking out loud, isn't that like a problem for confirmation bias?
1712186	1712686	174	D	0.99954	Right?
1712788	1715454	175	D	0.96407	Like there's a paper in here.
1715492	1730200	176	D	0.76576	Here because we create the knowledge and we tell everyone the knowledge this is the model, this is how everything behaves and then we update our knowledge about it and then we look for everything to just confirm it.
1733930	1753580	177	D	0.99998	Maybe there's other system that will not let us be getting knowledge so slowly because if everybody just agrees on something we teach it to everyone and we confirm the model and then we just try to look for evidence for that model then we go slowly if there's any better thing or better model that comes along.
1756380	1758040	178	A	0.97192	Yeah, a lot to say about that.
1758110	1764044	179	A	0.97322	Like if we believe that trees exist or that people exist and then we come to see them.
1764082	1775696	180	A	0.99994	So there's kind of this sense where problem confirmation bias which I think is a great term, a great topic to bring in with definitely also what's called like the golden nail syndrome or something.
1775878	1793284	181	A	0.99999	If all you have is the hammer then everything is a nail and there's definitely attention there because it's like how much of what you can do are you supposed to do something that you can't do, but then at least you could do what you needed to do to get there.
1793322	1795256	182	A	0.99998	So that's actually within your scope of what you can do.
1795278	1801880	183	A	0.99997	So it's not that there are things that you can't do that you can't do if just from a measurement perspective.
1802860	1806108	184	A	0.71038	So how does it look?
1806194	1835590	185	A	1.0	Or how do we recognize across systems or how do we have awareness in situations as limited individuals who do have all of these cognitive phenomena, how to make decisions or sense making or infrastructure or whatever it is the socialness the system of interest of the social sciences make that and then dot, dot, dot normatively what?
1839480	1852570	186	B	1.0	I think there's some protection built into the problem of confirmation bias because all knowledge generation is happening in an open system.
1853180	1885712	187	B	1.0	And so there's always going to be an agent outside of your own mind and what it's perceiving that can then challenge or add to the super, the LK 99 semiconductors that has been all the rage recently and how other scientists have now kind of discredited it quite convincingly.
1885776	1903320	188	B	1.0	And it's because of this open they might have had degrees of confirmation bias that they were egging each other on, but it's ultimately been refuted, which is this built in kind of protection because it's all operating in an open system.
1903470	1904440	189	B	0.99068	Fortunately.
1908200	1910724	190	A	0.64182	Yeah, a lot to say there.
1910922	1935580	191	A	0.99988	Monday Morning Reviewer twoing how how do we again go from any given description of a communicative event like the kind of specific unfolding of the LK 99 narrative, as yet uncompleted in the minds of some, which is real enough to be real socially?
1937040	1956850	192	A	0.92268	So how do we go from any descriptive anything about that total observation to core screening then how do we come to work with that interface, with whatever that is hands that to us?
1965930	1967990	193	A	0.99584	What is the social behavior?
1968730	1984410	194	A	0.99972	What are some classic or some novel social behavioral, maybe ones that seem pretty obvious due to recency bias?
1999170	2009710	195	A	0.98136	I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the autopoietic nature of information systems.
2010850	2022530	196	A	0.99015	Andrew, do you have any thought on this or about where autopoiesis comes into, like, social sciences or these kinds of models?
2024250	2031078	197	B	0.95923	Daniel andrew just left a note that he's back.
2031164	2032822	198	A	0.83003	He just wasn't looking at the time.
2032956	2034054	199	A	0.99869	Funny stuff.
2034252	2036040	200	A	0.99933	Anyone else have a thought on that?
2040970	2044282	201	A	0.74	Okay, just just to kind of carry forward then.
2044416	2063778	202	A	0.99999	Basically the ability of social systems that include written niche modification, cumulative culture, their increasing extent of control as discussed earlier, that definitely is a bit of an overloaded or at.
2063784	2076006	203	A	1.0	Least doubly meant term in different settings because it can just simply mean modeling it with control theory, which is a pretty limited philosophical statement relative to any statistical method or control.
2076108	2083926	204	A	0.85127	Like the kind that people are unhappy with and the kind that's described in Thinking Like a State.
2084108	2095178	205	A	0.58	And a lot of other works that I know Mahault and Lorena and Abel are going to be definitely going into more detail on.
2095264	2132674	206	A	0.60992	So when societies can model and introspect or self reflect formally much better, and that can happen through anything from free and open source federated protocols, there's many limited formats of self meaning making, but cryptography definitely allows those explorations, and that doesn't necessarily mean computer cryptography.
2132722	2143610	207	A	0.99999	That could also be like linguistic encoding and all these other ways of niche sub differentiation in multiscale systems.
2144110	2150170	208	A	1.0	You just do not see a system that is cookie cutter.
2150750	2155066	209	A	0.99948	It's very rare in ecosystems.
2155258	2157920	210	A	0.99698	There are algal blooms and things like that.
2159570	2180258	211	A	0.99723	So when we really think about the developmental and the cognitive and the selective niche, which is a concept that Axel Constant and others have differentiated in some of their ecological active inference, like, that niche is very embodied, extended.
2180434	2182770	212	A	0.56	And cultured, et cetera, et cetera.
2182930	2203390	213	A	0.5392	It's just like a kind of cool, direct way to open up to that challenge of modeling and just bring some closures with different accounts or compatibilities with different accounts.
2206130	2207662	214	A	0.9	Just to give one random example.
2207716	2210160	215	A	0.99996	But maybe it'd be interesting what what other people think.
2211490	2220420	216	A	0.77	All the expressions that people make in social settings can just simply be their expressions or modeled as such.
2221590	2238530	217	A	0.99994	That is in one way implicitly what was always in play, but now it's describable and legible and autonomous.
2238610	2261950	218	A	0.97437	So how do we take this active inference, collective behavior crossover and think about what it really means in how we're going to be thinking differently, even just this discussion forward or more locally, our understandings with collective behavior or with behavior?
2294040	2297224	219	B	0.55881	Daniel, can you ask the question again?
2297342	2301992	220	B	1.0	I didn't actually catch the question.
2302126	2315820	221	A	0.64681	How do we start to adapt some of these general comments or frames that are in some ways disconnected from descriptions of real systems?
2316240	2322350	222	A	0.99999	How do we think about that and what it means now?
2327280	2328284	223	A	0.83	Sorry, go ahead.
2328402	2329330	224	A	0.9659	That's okay.
2330500	2333010	225	B	0.99994	Do you mean on the document in front of us?
2334420	2338340	226	B	0.99998	These disconnected things in front of us, they're on the document.
2340200	2343430	227	A	1.0	I don't know, whatever you think or whatever you want to say.
2345640	2361814	228	B	1.0	Okay, yeah, I again, I hope I'm not fully understanding the question.
2361852	2378810	229	B	1.0	I hope I'm not steering away too much, but I had a general sense of what I think you were saying, and I think it's an enormous problem with the amount of information sharing.
2380430	2399140	230	B	0.98	Just let's just take the generative models of social media and all of the platforms that are available to us, how much information we are privy to in any given moment.
2401990	2422940	231	B	1.0	And I'm kind of forgetting the question that you asked, but how do you it's almost as if there is such a high rate of information and data flow that it's really hard to know what to do with all of it.
2424590	2425674	232	B	1.0	At least as a human being.
2425712	2430806	233	B	0.99963	I'm not saying for machines, but as a psychologist.
2430838	2449200	234	B	0.99993	I'm certainly interested in how humans are able to tolerate and respond to the amount and rate of information that's out there.
2462760	2465540	235	D	0.99924	This is not the first time this happens, right?
2465610	2477770	236	D	0.98617	Like we went from talking to writing information, then everyone wrote their information and then we have books and then we have libraries and that's all available.
2478300	2483992	237	D	1.0	And again, we have access, if you can read right, to all the information in the world.
2484046	2496184	238	D	0.99922	So we adapted to, I don't know, to get careers so we could specify in which type of information you are going to know more.
2496322	2503890	239	D	0.81076	So maybe we need some sort of new career type, I don't know, more specification with more information.
2504580	2510616	240	B	0.99896	But is the rate of information flow and increase?
2510748	2512260	241	B	0.98	Is it not exponential?
2514280	2514932	242	D	0.71	I don't know.
2514986	2518212	243	D	0.99013	It's a crazy amount and our brains cannot do anything about it.
2518346	2524010	244	D	0.99525	So we have to do multidisciplinary things and work together with others if we want to make something.
2525100	2530570	245	D	0.99925	But yeah, I don't know, maybe we will die of excess of information.
2564220	2585384	246	A	0.99963	How do people feel like active inference brings something to the discussion relative to how they want to work towards ants?
2585432	2589484	247	A	0.9995	Yeah, well, isn't that the provocative question too?
2589682	2592380	248	A	0.99989	But like any system, that's the question.
2592450	2612660	249	A	0.9997	Everyone is going to have their own memes and themes and systems that they have spent time with and did field work with and all this other particularity because a system that doesn't have particularity is just not going to be hosting a broad enough niche for phenotypic diversity.
2613640	2621748	250	A	0.97874	It's just riding on the edge of a razor instead of more like a fabric that continues to unfold.
2621844	2654102	251	A	1.0	I think there's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference just from what I was reading, trying to find things for this discussion and just I personally wondered what is meaningful or interesting or useful, what's epistemic and pragmatic value for different audiences?
2654166	2678786	252	A	0.99091	How does it go from kind of bringing citations that were not linked together in some more theoretical or more generative model oriented work in active inference like epistemic foraging or the infra ants model or any other kind of specific model?
2678888	2686920	253	A	0.99996	What do these different kinds of scientific artifacts do for who?
2703960	2723376	254	B	0.96	I guess I'm still learning very crudely ploddling along here, Daniel, to try and answer that because I've quickly realized that the field is so multi nodal.
2723508	2736240	255	B	0.96829	It has so much the free energy principle, the Bayesian brain, even just to psychology, has so much applicability.
2736660	2743380	256	B	1.0	And everyone I meet at these discussions is coming at it from a different angle.
2744280	2758760	257	B	1.0	And it can be a bit confusing to hear how other people are applying it, how other people are making use of it in all manner of ways.
2758830	2788880	258	B	1.0	And so I'm still learning how to apply to kind of ring fence, the free energy principle and connect it to psychological processes including collective behavior because there's a lot of psychopathology in group think in collective behavior, but I'm also very interested in its application at the interface of what happens between a therapist and a patient.
2790180	2814824	259	B	0.6089	I'm often, unlike other professions, who are just by nature of the scientific method, are able to extract a lot more data to work with, to analyze, to, you know, in a in a that's very hard to do.
2814862	2825180	260	B	1.0	I feel very limited other than just making kind of theoretical leaps and inferences about how to apply the free energy principle to psychology.
2827760	2847060	261	B	1.0	I can't have a session with my brain hooked up to an fMRI machine to get data and to see when a patient says boo or bar, that's a spike on the spike trains, which represents surprisal, and we can then solve for that in some way.
2847210	2861370	262	B	1.0	I don't have access to that sort of data flow, so it feels limited, but I'm still learning how to apply it and trying to collaborate with colleagues on the influence group.
2875520	2906848	263	A	0.99998	What are people wondering about collective behavior, even if we're totally, of course, not going to address it, but just what are the kinds of things that people what makes you look up collective behavior instead of just behavior or individual behavioral?
2907024	2910760	264	B	0.58	For me, it's about safety and need to belong.
2916380	2931784	265	D	1.0	For me, I think that it depends where you come from and the country you are, but there are places that are more collective, and there are places that are more individualistic.
2931832	2940064	266	D	1.0	And I think mostly non Western countries have a lot of collective behavior and knowledge and spirits already.
2940182	2940656	267	D	0.82779	Right.
2940758	2945840	268	D	0.99012	That they already knew these things that we think are new for us.
2945910	2946288	269	D	0.96355	Right.
2946374	2951284	270	D	0.99982	How the collective thing works, for example, I don't know.
2951322	2953348	271	D	0.68	You don't make a decision for yourself.
2953514	2955380	272	D	0.78	You make a decision for the group.
2955450	2956256	273	D	0.99999	Like marrying.
2956288	2959156	274	D	1.0	You marry because you want an addition.
2959268	2962680	275	D	1.0	You want to interact with someone or other group.
2962750	2967160	276	D	1.0	And that's something that affects the collective, not just you.
2967230	2969400	277	D	0.99997	So arranged marriage makes sense.
2969550	2970520	278	D	1.0	Something like that.
2970590	2970920	279	D	0.99927	Right.
2970990	2985040	280	D	0.99927	So for me, making that distinction about individual collective comes from understanding that, I don't know, there are other places that are already ahead in what collective means in terms of human beings and how to interact.
2985700	2995228	281	D	0.93	And the Western world, we have all this individualistic thing, which is very interesting because why do we have the same species?
2995324	3003540	282	D	1.0	And then we have very different approaches of how to understand ourselves in terms of what an individual is and why it matters.
3014580	3015136	283	A	0.95	Yes.
3015238	3033770	284	A	0.99669	There's so much loaded on different understandings among people, including even the essence of the social, which is who are people and what is the obligation and how do we view that relationship?
3035500	3038970	285	A	0.99983	That's a very deep area.
3039500	3059696	286	A	0.53308	Again, the part that just kept returning to me in the lecture and when I was trying to think about how to even reflect part of this very large area is like, what is the adjective doing and what's the reference point by which this is being said in.
3059718	3072880	287	A	1.0	The speech act like people often will dismiss I don't mean to straw people but dismiss collective behavior by saying well, we are explaining individual behavior.
3073040	3080344	288	A	0.99991	What are you explaining beyond the nest mates in the colony and then the exterior, that is it.
3080542	3086120	289	A	1.0	And so that can feel like looking at the same thing from two different sides.
3086700	3100220	290	A	1.0	And there are different methods, like some methods blur over individuals a lot more like statistical methods that might correspond to demographics and then on the other hand, like more agent based models.
3103040	3115180	291	A	0.99997	But how much variability and what shared variability in what general synchronies amongst different quantum reference frames?
3115260	3136730	292	A	0.54	All these nested at least possibilities that are grounded in wanting to explore mathematical and scientific possibilities as the literature of linear regression is full of so many incredible extensions and similar.
3137500	3168390	293	A	1.0	And then I think what the course is even beginning to try to express and what I understand in the works of the other teachers and a lot of your backgrounds and everything like that is where is that moment where it is not only science, because science is not simply the social.
3169400	3183400	294	A	0.99996	So science as an activity and then as there's a diffusion away from science, or at least that relationship between social and science is right there in the title.
3183900	3201256	295	A	1.0	Maybe that's kind of like a science major's take but it is itself in a way presenting a dilemma with what science means there and then that's the frame game who's doing social science?
3201448	3204080	296	A	0.93258	Who's doing not social science?
3205380	3216660	297	A	0.99	And that's where in the culture I'm sitting in, in the technical side of that it is related to statistics and formality.
3217000	3232520	298	A	0.99974	It's the Xkcd comic and the way that formalisms and details are taken as under some regimes of attention basically definitive.
3233900	3239850	299	A	1.0	And yet there's like a yearning and a counterbalancing that's expressed also in many ways.
3243580	3252600	300	A	0.96	And science maybe some people feel like certain social scientific methods that's like not far enough in this dimension and then the others feel like they're too far in this direction.
3253540	3261120	301	A	0.97318	But it's like just like that academic field, let alone any other community of diverse agents.
3261270	3270164	302	A	0.54	Of course there's going to be distributions of perspectives at different times and rate.
3270202	3272340	303	B	0.99	Of uptake by those different perspectives.
3275960	3288600	304	B	0.82759	Daniel, do you think these first principles would be able to explain why an ant colony exists?
3288940	3293230	305	B	1.0	I know that was your kind of area of interest of study.
3293600	3310432	306	B	0.99982	Why an ant colony exists in the way that it does as a operating as a collective and why another animal is able to survive and achieve its.
3310486	3311200	307	C	0.99935	Goals.
3313780	3323956	308	B	0.99999	As an individual only relying on the environment and its actions and sensations to get its needs met and to no doubt minimize its free energy.
3324058	3335400	309	B	0.99999	But could first principles explain why the one has to survive as a group and the other has to survive or is able to survive under different conditions?
3337420	3340452	310	A	0.99983	Yeah, that's a super interesting question.
3340606	3348936	311	A	0.98784	It's very core to this individuation and multiscale individuation concept.
3349128	3352536	312	A	0.99701	Like is the nest mate the individual and then the colony?
3352568	3353432	313	A	1.0	Is the social?
3353586	3356080	314	A	0.86828	Because then for sure it's super collaborative.
3356500	3358796	315	A	1.0	Or is the colony the organism?
3358988	3364140	316	A	0.99	And nest mates are tissues and then are they social across colony boundaries?
3364300	3370550	317	A	0.99975	Not where I was in Arizona, but they're often friendly across different species and they avoided conflict more often than not.
3371480	3379832	318	A	0.92	And then why does it even matter what's happening on this plot of lands in this area?
3379966	3385124	319	A	0.99998	From like a biomimicry perspective, we might learn new algorithms.
3385172	3390816	320	A	0.98774	It's a sandbox for learning new techniques and observation, all these other richnesses.
3390868	3399340	321	A	0.97657	So it's to say though, what comes away from that science that makes it social science.
3400720	3439080	322	A	1.0	And I think there's a lot of disciplinary ways of understanding that, which I'm definitely not expert in in the professional fields like counseling, but probably in all the different humanities and histories and all these other fields, all these different maps, the kind of social the epistemic organizing question and then the social organizing question and the way that technology is also in that tangle.
3439420	3447756	323	A	0.98	And yeah, someone pointed out like, this is not a new problem, but then it's like, well, what parts are new?
3447858	3452504	324	A	1.0	And then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or too individualist or too collective?
3452552	3453660	325	A	1.0	On what scale?
3454080	3459072	326	A	0.99998	What if they're like, really collectivist at this scale, but not at this scale or another?
3459126	3476260	327	A	0.99	An example of an ambiguous or at least like polysimus phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation of non reproductive nest mates.
3476680	3484808	328	A	1.0	And that has often been modeled from a position of zero is the law and how are they cheating above this?
3484974	3490768	329	A	0.99999	But it's also been approached from a colony level strategic bet hedging.
3490964	3508690	330	A	0.9209	So without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics of the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept off the table if it was even that's a very integrated problem.
3509540	3513696	331	A	0.60017	So it helps you approach collective systems and learn about them.
3513718	3522580	332	A	0.99997	But it's like there's a lot to say about humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture.
3523000	3532680	333	A	1.0	And human foraging is a lot more sophisticated from just like a perception, cognition, influence, perspective.
3534300	3541516	334	A	0.99914	So those are just some ant related thoughts, but it just centers a lot of discussions that really matter.
3541698	3549870	335	A	1.0	And I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're thought to by some.
3551280	3563104	336	B	0.68947	Yeah, and it's very hard to get any kind of cross pollination or to see cross pollination studying one agent.
3563222	3568950	337	B	0.9211	It's quite, at least to my mind, very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents.
3569400	3585384	338	B	0.9996	It starts getting a bit tricky to infer one collective's how and why and how they survive and how another agent does.
3585422	3586920	339	B	0.94686	It's tricky.
3587660	3590260	340	B	0.99961	So I'm almost just going to an agent.
3590430	3595870	341	B	0.99754	Human beings, as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible.
3598560	3602700	342	B	0.99989	Otherwise it's just information overload.
3612180	3624672	343	A	0.75761	Body is a complex place too, and digital technology, virtuality, these are such richly developed topics in the social sciences.
3624736	3653340	344	A	1.0	I only know the tiniest amount from but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations and everything, there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths and it's being approached seemingly multiple layers.
3654320	3661340	345	A	0.99	The two layers that just we can focus most narrowly on is like within the realm of science, what is science?
3661840	3669276	346	A	1.0	Which is kind of like playing this other role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems, what is science?
3669308	3670864	347	A	0.99999	Who gets to decide what social science is?
3670902	3671440	348	A	1.0	I don't know.
3671510	3677670	349	A	0.99986	I'm not in social science but it's system of interest to society and certainly I'm a part of that.
3678440	3690100	350	A	0.99979	So it's like what is good technically, what is social scientific and then what is that social scientific?
3690180	3706590	351	A	0.99996	How is that going to interface into the metaphysical questions and the normative ethical and the decision making with trade offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter?
3707920	3734410	352	A	0.99997	Also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences, what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior?
3745250	3760750	353	A	1.0	One point that I would have added in to the lecture was just that in distributed systems, whether as modeled or as such, all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals.
3760830	3765430	354	A	0.7391	Even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism, it's like all about the local interactions.
3765850	3778762	355	A	1.0	And so that is an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands off layer at least, if not much more.
3778816	3793470	356	A	1.0	Another nice feature about them, they are in a way waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain at least two layers of consideration.
3794130	3808846	357	A	1.0	Now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in that way that more arising function can be modeled.
3808958	3815798	358	A	0.99985	But in either way then you can kind of wrap that two layer system and then compose them.
3815964	3823206	359	A	0.99998	So that's like what enables in certain situations like parallelization or at least that's obviously a big area.
3823388	3856418	360	A	0.99999	But that's what allows multi agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging sense making and action selection problems, not by guarantee or default because any given slicing and dicing of any given prompting of information may not help you adapt but there are paths that do and don't help, persist or not.
3856584	3863362	361	A	1.0	And that's this kind of persistence starting place that we began with.
3863416	3864290	362	A	0.99345	Sasha.
3867920	3888530	363	E	0.55411	Yeah, I really resonate with what you mentioned about the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information.
3889220	3931360	364	E	1.0	And it actually makes me think a lot about the psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information about the person's sort of local environment and behavior or perhaps demographics and age, that their informational environment, like a wealth of what kind of information they consume, might also be really telling about their psychological and behavior interactions or pathologies.
3934820	3946020	365	E	1.0	And then to bring it kind of full circle back to that the researcher is part of the ecosystem that they are studying.
3949880	3966750	366	E	0.53394	Yeah, I think it's just such a difference in perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that the way that you would design and run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience.
3967120	3985280	367	E	1.0	And so that is a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not like a negative perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying truth or reality.
3987140	3988960	368	E	0.9497	So, just a few thoughts.
3993700	3994544	369	A	0.95009	Very interesting.
3994662	3998370	370	A	0.99985	Anyone want to add something?
4004830	4019950	371	A	1.0	I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelt term from ethology behavioral research observation science using the term to describe the world as it is experienced by a particular organism.
4020690	4024734	372	A	1.0	I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of discussion in discourse.
4024862	4043090	373	A	0.93311	This is just to give it like a super short overview the world we might connect to world modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different pros focus on qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence.
4043250	4052566	374	A	0.99997	World modeling as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones because this is the area of phenomenology.
4052598	4058138	375	A	0.99	And so this is like a kind of semi eternal discussion point.
4058304	4079860	376	A	0.99947	So whether active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain whereas as it is experienced is going to be a philosophical question and then by a particular organism that specificity we get by actually making the generative model even if we're just speculating about it.
4080630	4092710	377	A	0.56299	It's like talking about experience without an experiencer would be like talking about some agent's behavior without reference to its niche.
4094250	4119310	378	A	0.57	And then where there is like that complex negotiation I think the humanities and a lot of the social sciences have identified a lot of the structural top down and also the personal bottom up motifs of things being blurred and made complex.
4120610	4147538	379	A	1.0	And so I think part of the social and the scientific as coming only from the scientific side is like to meet in the third space and or at least make it work to have a mutual compromise where it's like certain social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure that is going to be a judgment call.
4147724	4151494	380	A	0.99774	But understanding that conversation, where is it a mutual compromise?
4151622	4153206	381	A	0.99904	In what dimensions?
4153398	4158246	382	A	0.99999	Not simply along the kind of rigor, accessibility or implications axis.
4158278	4180000	383	A	0.99977	There's just very many things in play in these Iterated relationships in ecosystems, having a researcher as part of the ecosystem.
4180500	4183696	384	A	0.99958	Well, here's the forager question.
4183798	4186332	385	A	0.74317	We see the nest mate on the ground, it's a forager.
4186396	4189360	386	A	0.99976	But then we step back, it's like, okay, well, it's foraging.
4190040	4192928	387	A	0.88	And then that's the allocation of the forager.
4193024	4213720	388	A	0.9467	Then its foraging is still part of this sense making, this generative sense making with process understanding even of a trace, which is something that Bruno Latour and others have explored with, like following a trace in a social setting and using that to trace networks.
4214640	4221550	389	A	0.99593	So in our digital ecosystems, though, our information ecosystems is not research happening.
4222800	4225084	390	A	1.0	And so what does that really mean?
4225202	4228480	391	A	1.0	And then what are those social normativities?
4228820	4240660	392	A	0.99998	There is going to be like a meeting or a handoff with where that really is happening, or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored.
4242760	4249476	393	A	1.0	Or it could be whatever metaphor in that setting it actually is.
4249658	4254692	394	A	0.94361	There's no general metaphor because that'd be like, oh, what's the general metaphor on this experiment?
4254756	4255800	395	A	0.99986	Which experiment?
4256700	4259560	396	A	1.0	Just the general action that we plan to take.
4259630	4263290	397	A	1.0	Oh, hard to say.
4288940	4289944	398	B	0.69366	It okay.
4289982	4298556	399	A	0.99866	Well, in our last sections, I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look at, otherwise, what are any other thoughts?
4298588	4310840	400	A	1.0	Or like, what what can we learn more about about collective behavior?
4311280	4316990	401	A	0.85	Or what will it mean for our sense making, decision making, if we understand collective behavior better?
4379830	4383320	402	A	0.99836	What else are people excited about for the rest of the course?
4390570	4406620	403	A	0.96985	Like, based upon the sections that we've done so far and how we can even start to approach this in an acknowledged, limited, finite way?
4408270	4408682	404	A	0.97678	Yeah.
4408736	4410620	405	A	0.99526	Sasha than anyone else.
4413730	4431774	406	E	1.0	I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes, and it makes me think about how, working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour, we're able to kind of leave a stigmagic trace of things we've discussed.
4431902	4440802	407	E	1.0	And what sort of traits or practices should individual humans I guess I should specify humans.
4440946	4446710	408	E	0.5759	Should we embody in order to improve cohesion in collective behavior?
4447050	4459130	409	E	0.99989	It makes me think of certain psychology traits or descriptions of, like, openness or conscientiousness.
4460690	4470270	410	E	0.99994	What will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior?
4476490	4509010	411	B	0.99322	Yeah, I think to add to that, to just emphasize the importance, again, only with human agents, specifically, who have the capacity to think and reflect, and the only ones that have those really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet, but to really kind of leverage in order to make the collective better.
4509160	4544170	412	B	0.82875	There's a responsibility of the individual, despite being part of a collective on many different fronts, to be able to leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned, and to be able to think, to retain the individual's mind and think about the collective, I think is so important if the collective is to become healthier.
4544330	4546394	413	B	0.54821	Sasha, to your point, and to improve.
4546442	4547040	414	C	0.66083	Its.
4551080	4558090	415	B	0.92	To become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be.
4563710	4572670	416	B	0.74338	So to always try and maintain a thinking self is crucial.
4574530	4578640	417	B	0.98	You can very easily be usurped into the collective as is.
4580210	4594946	418	B	0.99999	If you just go on any social media platform, you will see individuals rarely thinking for themselves and seemingly kind of just fueling each other.
4594968	4596920	419	B	1.0	And that causes massive problems.
4597610	4604600	420	B	0.88115	So an individual mind strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward.
4610250	4612118	421	A	0.4082	It yeah.
4612204	4623246	422	A	0.99974	This dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these ongoing negotiated compromise that can be also viewed many ways.
4623348	4634590	423	A	0.99937	However, they are cognitive science coming into play.
4636720	4654550	424	A	0.99999	Maybe historical processes or philosophies were used in many settings for even approaching these kinds of social questions.
4655720	4667400	425	A	0.88	And now with computer science and technology, it even is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action.
4668460	4683550	426	A	1.0	Not that those are new in and of themselves, but thinking like a state, like the development of the apparatus, the development of the social systems that can be run on open source hardware, open source software, things like that.
4688340	4707590	427	A	1.0	I don't know if something's generalized across all such groups, but understanding what environments, at least initially things are beginning at is just a realist starting point.
4709160	4716810	428	A	0.99999	Probably no guarantee since most things, all things are swept off the table in their specifics anyway.
4721580	4741516	429	A	1.0	And how to deal with that kind of like skin on the line type of decision making is very interesting how it's pursued in the sciences because often many runs are presented or that kind of catastrophic failure mode of models is not considered.
4741548	4753540	430	A	0.81795	It's just like part of the training, starting naive so just the way that different social considerations are converged upon.
4754200	4761110	431	A	0.99956	It's not like reduced to one feature of the social because the social is such an open space.
4763820	4778220	432	A	0.98342	As a scientist, always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up the situations which are, like, mundane, but also, of course, very deep and meaningful.
4779120	4781580	433	A	0.99853	Also, though, mundane.
4819360	4829810	434	A	0.99993	Any other thoughts or otherwise on collective behavior or on the social sciences course or anything?
4830340	4834610	435	A	0.66856	Otherwise people can have any last words if they want.
4841030	4841442	436	A	0.99029	Yeah.
4841496	4841858	437	A	0.99996	Awesome.
4841944	4843726	438	A	0.99993	Thank you all for participating.
4843918	4845410	439	A	0.99971	David, want to add anything?
4845480	4846210	440	B	0.52426	Excellent.
4855690	4856102	441	A	0.99714	Yeah.
4856156	4861182	442	A	0.99957	Well, I look forward to more questions being asked on the course website.
4861316	4866186	443	A	1.0	And everybody's engagement with the course is very much appreciated.
4866298	4868634	444	A	0.93752	So keep up the collective.
4868762	4872030	445	A	0.69132	Thanks for multiscale learning, and it's a fun course.
4872100	4877070	446	A	0.99985	Really happy that we could have done the session and very happy to have concluded the session.
4880050	4881710	447	A	0.95	All right, thank you.
4881780	4882426	448	B	0.99858	Bye bye.
4882458	4883290	449	B	0.3457	Bern ciao.
