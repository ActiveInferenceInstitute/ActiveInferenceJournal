5460	6010	A	0.546256959438324	You.
8300	9160	A	0.872096598148346	Hello and welcome.
9230	11832	A	0.8831276893615723	It's August 16, 2023.
11966	22170	A	0.9000584483146667	We're in the collective behavior discussion section of the active inference for the Social sciences course in 2023.
22540	37456	A	0.8465918898582458	So perhaps let us all go around and give an opening in introduction and or reflection and see who joins and what happens from there.
37558	40530	A	0.5243538618087769	But just so that everybody has said hello.
48840	49412	B	0.5403040051460266	Hi, everyone.
49466	53092	B	0.8864105343818665	I'm Brun 09:00 P.m.
53146	58490	B	0.9731149673461914	In South Africa, and, yeah, just excited to be and see what happens.
66580	67708	C	0.7334303259849548	Hi, I'm Andrew.
67804	79184	C	0.8523013591766357	I'm a graduate student in Indiana, and I guess my field of interest now is knowledge management.
79232	92890	C	0.9467377662658691	And I think that figuring out how we collectively learn and can share information is a really interesting topic, and I'd like to see how this would apply.
97850	115646	D	0.6924690008163452	Hi, I'm Gina, and I'm from Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain, studying and doing experiments related to this topic and trying to learn a little bit of the theory that's behind it so we can advance better.
115828	116910	D	0.9854174256324768	I'm excited.
120610	121166	E	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
121268	122266	E	0.8222151398658752	My name is Sasha.
122298	124282	E	0.8783743977546692	I'm calling in from California.
124346	126000	E	0.8681784868240356	I'm also a graduate student.
127190	132562	E	0.9811331629753113	Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited presentation last week.
132616	134450	E	0.9418640732765198	I'm looking forward to a discussion.
136310	146790	A	0.8567530512809753	All right, well, how about anyone can give a first reflection on collective behavior?
148170	156154	A	0.914059042930603	What was their thought or context before, and where are they at as we kind of begin?
156272	157370	A	0.7547249794006348	Yeah, Regina.
160830	170718	D	0.7137041091918945	Okay, so I just want to make sure that I understand because I took, like, two big lessons from your lesson, right?
170804	185586	D	0.8301147818565369	And the first one is that this famous model of active inference that has the agent and the environment and the Markov blanket in the middle, right?
185688	187826	D	0.7714589238166809	And just interacts with everything.
187928	188386	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
188488	209318	D	0.7366173267364502	So I think what I got from what you discuss, maybe I didn't have a good definition of an agent, but first, that you can have that agent not be just an individual, but also your definition of an individual changes depending on what you want to study in the behavior.
209414	209818	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
209904	222174	D	0.8247288465499878	So an agent can be an ant, it can be an ecosystem, it can be an eye looking at something, or it can be as a society, for example.
222292	234420	D	0.6446401476860046	And I think that's a big take for me because it changes a lot the concept of how to study things and use active imprints just by changing how big the agent can be.
234790	237220	D	0.6002848148345947	So I don't know if I got that right.
237830	239890	D	0.7789794206619263	So first, that clarification.
243340	244970	A	0.7771714925765991	So what is an agent?
249820	254616	D	0.6318361759185791	Yeah, so I don't know if there's, like, a formal definition of an agent in active inference.
254728	255100	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
255170	267148	D	0.6893796920776367	But if we want to study whatever we want, because I'm about study, because I have to do that's, like, my goal, whatever I'm doing.
267314	274496	D	0.8049614429473877	So I want to study whatever I have to choose what's going to be my agent and the environment it has.
274678	281270	D	0.8760631680488586	So choosing the agent, you can do it to create a model or to make an experiment, whatever.
281800	292088	D	0.8701025247573853	But the choice you make, it will depend on what you understand as an individual or as an agent?
292254	293288	D	0.5470303893089294	I think so.
293374	294010	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
305070	305482	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
305536	307020	A	0.8210042119026184	Anyone have a thought on that?
308750	313440	D	0.8413481712341309	If I continue with something, just to add something else, and this will be my mind.
314530	335220	D	0.5984042882919312	And then I'm thinking, is that also a big problem that we have or I think I have, is that since I am part of the environment, you know, the perspective of whoever is studying whatever it is, it's also going to be an effect in it.
335530	347720	D	0.5113365054130554	So maybe scientists already decided, but I don't know that we can never have an objective way of studying something if you're part of the environment of the agent.
348250	356234	D	0.492196261882782	So, I don't know, we already forgot it or we already decided that's it we cannot have objective observations of behavior in general.
356432	365742	D	0.6991559863090515	But you always think about the agent environment and you studying it as something else, but something else is also affecting it.
365796	378226	D	0.7546038627624512	So I see that as a problem or maybe something that has to be said, like we are not objective because we're part of what it's affecting our agents in the behavior collectively too.
378408	381540	D	0.8680810928344727	So those are the thoughts I have to share.
384230	387174	B	0.6935847401618958	Regina, I'm also new to all of this.
387212	408634	B	0.8345179557800293	So my preliminary understanding of what is an agent is anything that has any good reason to self evidence and to itself or to survive that doesn't want to dissipate, that might delineate the boundary of what an agent is.
408672	423946	B	0.8978041410446167	That then sets up the boundaries with which it will, as you describe, start interacting with the world, with the environment.
424138	436600	B	0.8423932790756226	So if something, as I understand it, if something has a reason to go on being to survive, then it is an agent in the world.
439130	442120	D	0.8031401634216309	Okay, but that agent could be anything, right?
443450	444534	D	0.7803755402565002	Is that what you're saying?
444572	444726	D	0.7360090017318726	Right?
444748	454810	D	0.6259359121322632	Like, if he wants to survive, can be an ant surviving individually or a cell or a a good that's like a good definition.
458190	458940	D	0.584351658821106	Okay.
461170	461582	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
461636	462590	A	0.7013376355171204	Sasha.
464370	465118	E	0.8961713314056396	Great points.
465204	467134	E	0.7798610329627991	Regina, so much to say.
467172	494454	E	0.8485327959060669	There something that I have experience with as a researcher in biology is deciding the kind of the statistics or sampling approach to use, whether we're taking one cell from one individual or we're taking many cells from many individuals, and how to do the statistics and kind of sampling approach on that.
494652	505210	E	0.8609643578529358	That is an evergreen question that we're always reevaluating to see how to think about the independencies within biological systems.
507870	515338	E	0.8828464150428772	And then another thing that you mentioned was about the individual being part of the ecosystem.
515434	527650	E	0.7520422339439392	And that makes me think a lot about complexity science and something that is addressed there in thinking about the interplay of the scientists and what they're studying.
529750	531780	E	0.9277932047843933	Yeah, thank you for those points.
539540	540156	B	0.7013376355171204	Sasha.
540188	544390	B	0.559265673160553	Can sorry, I'm not raising my hand, I'm just unmuting it.
545080	545956	B	0.7335982322692871	That's okay.
546058	549460	B	0.8920724987983704	Can you say a bit more about what you mean by complexity science?
562340	563600	A	0.7365944981575012	Maybe muted?
565240	567190	A	0.6801614761352539	Oh, can't speak at the moment.
570280	571030	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
571720	578010	A	0.7913513779640198	Complexity science has looked at agent based modeling as a fundamental tool.
578380	596508	A	0.9118418097496033	John Holland signals and boundaries, focusing on what from an active inference side, we might say, as like message passing or communication for the messages and then boundaries with the whole discussion around the boundaries in the world.
596594	600040	A	0.5515349507331848	Map territory, map territory fallacy.
600200	601796	A	0.5972657203674316	Map territory fallacy.
601848	602800	A	0.5416264533996582	Fallacy.
604260	606240	A	0.7956063747406006	Doing iterative modeling.
607060	632040	A	0.8495104312896729	Sasha brought up limited experimental resources in the scientific setting, and that's kind of analogous to the limited energy budget or attentional budget ultimately, or just decision making budget of the kinds of active entities that make sense to model the ones that kind of have those characteristics.
633980	639640	A	0.808839738368988	This is really the question of what makes something first principles or what are the first principles?
640560	647240	A	0.5895004868507385	One aspect of it, as brought up is the censoring of the persistence.
647400	652560	A	0.8943207859992981	So from the outside, that's kind of like an empiricist's view of persistence, like, is it measurable?
652980	663570	A	0.8243324160575867	But not saying that something is necessarily that which is the statistical tool, and then the sort of like inside out implementation type.
665160	668820	A	0.8507187366485596	But there's a lot more to say in that.
668890	677480	A	0.9096028804779053	Who wants to bring in some new angle or how do they see collective behavior?
677980	680280	A	0.4951860308647156	Why do we talk about collective behavior?
681740	694380	A	0.7949746251106262	Why not just behavior, recognize that behavior is multiscale or is social, what's really being communicated with the collective?
704530	711042	D	0.648951530456543	I believe that we chose those levels so we can make it more simple for our brains to understand it.
711176	720580	D	0.873630702495575	Because if we talk about collective behavior, actually is the universe behaving and the particles and everything, right?
721190	733740	D	0.6941680312156677	So I don't know if that's a little bit just based on I don't know what's the word, like, just the material world and how it physically moves and that's like deterministic or whatever, right?
734110	746640	D	0.7753669619560242	But I think us, we chose to have those limitations so we could understand the world, but also we should acknowledge that our limited because we're part of the system.
748770	768820	C	0.6982240676879883	I'm having a little trouble on my kind of understanding, I guess, where the schism lies between kind of the Markov blanket and the umwelt in semiotics of the animals sensory experience.
777760	787070	C	0.8820600509643555	Anyone have maybe someone could Daniel, do you know the difference between that two?
788260	789804	A	0.7428231239318848	Can you be a little louder?
789852	790752	A	0.7900339365005493	Thank you, though.
790886	791372	A	0.6890372037887573	Andrew?
791436	792930	A	0.8210042119026184	Anyone have a thought on that?
794020	797744	A	0.8706034421920776	I'll bring in a definition of then and then we can see.
797782	799970	A	0.6003342270851135	But meanwhile, does anyone have a.
802100	802476	D	0.5092127919197083	Sorry.
802518	804704	A	0.6233943104743958	Sorry, I was just muted on zoom.
804752	813290	A	0.8073576092720032	Andrew, you're a little quiet, but I'm going to bring in a definition of umvelt and then meanwhile, does anyone have a thought?
825820	879636	B	0.867576539516449	I hope I'm not further diluting Andrew's question, but I think of collective behavior in kind of like, I don't know, a football team or a soccer team and what that provides the group who shares some common ethos and what that does to the how that regulates their collective or individual and collective free energies during a match or throughout the season, and how that gives some charge to some investment.
879748	886876	B	0.5926609039306641	Because it's my team against yours, and we have to try and win.
887058	917270	B	0.5805187225341797	And so without that collective behavior, it might be far harder to achieve a group's goals if they aren't able to collaborate and share implicitly and explicitly certain traits, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals, ideologies, whatever they might be, and how that then allows us to compete in the world.
922220	923768	D	0.6978175044059753	I see what you're saying.
923934	925480	D	0.6802724003791809	It's brain.
926160	927756	B	0.7477743625640869	Yes, okay.
927858	929310	D	0.6978175044059753	I see what you're saying.
930000	932748	D	0.6714068055152893	Especially because we're watching the World Cup, right?
932834	934300	D	0.8327361345291138	Women's World Cup.
935460	935872	D	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
935926	937440	D	0.7260989546775818	So it's very relevant.
938020	947384	D	0.7064692974090576	But I see that in all the things you've said, it seems that for you, behavior needs to have like a goal.
947532	950596	D	0.5887197852134705	And I don't know if I agree with that.
950618	953460	D	0.6774371266365051	It's either survival or winning.
954440	964504	D	0.5685645937919617	But maybe for me, it's just something that happens and maybe the consequence is surviving, but it's not the goal to survive or to win the game.
964702	966888	D	0.7778977155685425	I mean, in the football it is, right?
966974	977340	D	0.6373223066329956	But in general, maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively, just the thoughts.
978160	979150	B	0.854081392288208	It's interesting.
981760	983640	A	0.9187551140785217	Yeah, a lot of great comments.
983720	1005616	A	0.6889199614524841	Well, the paper of Connor Hines at all on the collective behavior as surprise minimization that points the way towards using the act infontology these kinds of modeling approaches for collective behavioral situations and really just recognizing them as a certain type of behavioral modeling.
1005728	1026616	A	0.7043192386627197	The simplest case might just be a single closed system, all part of the composition that leads to the ability to describe at very least a lot of different kinds of systems, just like a linear model can describe a lot of systems.
1026648	1048372	A	0.8964430093765259	So then it's also really interesting a topic that came up in one of the recent textbook groups with what's normative about active inference, because the term of the process theory, even of active inference being normative is mentioned multiple times.
1048426	1053696	A	0.735572338104248	And that's definitely a topic that connects to the social sciences.
1053888	1081580	A	0.8238723278045654	One can imagine the kind of niche normativity or niche regularities in a broad sense and then the real minute particulars of how they play out, which kind of hints at the kind of descriptive or causal minimum to start making some anything but toy specific generative models.
1085140	1152660	A	0.6150730848312378	So it's been an interesting theme to see, even already in Abel's and Ben's lectures and discussions this question between description process of describing which is what I associated with Professor Gordon's approach to ant watching how that descriptive process which is what we can say that we have for active inference, just like a linear modeling ecosystem could say about their linear modeling in principle, and how to then articulate the normativities of the framework, if that concept, if that separation can even exist from the behavioral normativities that include the basis of social fabric in all different kinds of communities.
1196170	1197510	A	0.7604458928108215	Here's another question.
1197580	1218970	A	0.9040666222572327	So what is the role of any technical detail in the social sciences, whether more on the statistical connecting with data or more category theoretic, like just formal?
1219630	1231790	A	0.8982558846473694	What's the role of formal methods in different kinds of academic or practical expressions about social systems.
1236850	1244720	A	0.735246479511261	Does it matter at all how we think about a framework at all?
1246370	1266200	C	0.7016727924346924	Well, for formalizing aspects of a social system, I would say that the purpose is for communication between individuals because just we can't verify that.
1267050	1272790	C	0.7690271139144897	Well, formalizing it is just setting a system on top of what you're observing.
1274190	1283450	C	0.7896977066993713	But there is no explicit guarantee what you're saying encompasses everything of the phenomena you're observing.
1283950	1284700	C	0.6189413666725159	And.
1288590	1289340	B	0.47801169753074646	Just.
1291550	1298366	C	0.5409326553344727	Kind of going back to Taoism of the name that can be named is not the true eternal name.
1298548	1306290	C	0.8232808709144592	And so it's just a way of it's a slice of what we can observe.
1306870	1320370	C	0.8500618934631348	And maybe you can make predictions or maybe you can generate something that acts like the phenomena you're observing.
1322790	1333766	C	0.8640269041061401	It's a way to kind of it's just a way to kind of approximate our understanding of some phenomena.
1333878	1347440	C	0.8316864967346191	And you have to slice it in a specific way, but also understanding that it is a slice or it is a tangent line that you're approximating as opposed to encompassing the whole system from verbalizing it.
1354790	1360786	D	0.7467003464698792	I will add maybe it's not the goal but something that happens out of describing any system.
1360888	1373478	D	0.547995924949646	Like Andrew said, it's like the goal to modify it or to corrupt it in some way to gain control or whatever.
1373564	1377894	D	0.7591843008995056	If you know the model, you know how to play the game, kind of.
1378092	1385178	D	0.6580143570899963	So you write instructions and try to see if you can outsmart someone else.
1385344	1387626	D	0.5910224914550781	I mean, it sounds kind of dark, right?
1387728	1394570	D	0.7176724672317505	But maybe it's one of the goals too, or something that just happens out of knowing the rules that nobody else knows.
1398550	1409490	C	0.5934248566627502	I guess when you talk about control, there is a shade that can be gained from that specific wording.
1409650	1423798	C	0.8672704100608826	But control in terms of control theory or that comes from electrical engineering and it's really just what shapes the behavior or what are the inputs that drive the behavior.
1423974	1431842	C	0.7711694240570068	And when you're talking about control, it's really just about well, if you change these inputs, how does that change the end behavior?
1431926	1468486	C	0.532682478427887	And so you can actually from electrical engineering of control in some sort of electromechanical system, but then you can make analogous statements on control into society which doesn't necessarily mean the dark negative control, but maybe there's some pathological behavior in a society or even pathological pathological responses within the brain and it's like, well, what is driving that?
1468508	1479340	C	0.7258609533309937	And is it possible to change the drivers of that to have something that is more beneficial to the system?
1485800	1504340	B	0.7103880643844604	Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's saying, because it matters how you manipulate a system or it matters how you affect a brain.
1504500	1505844	B	0.6509492993354797	So it cannot be random.
1505892	1513848	B	0.514762282371521	I mean, we've come a long way, for example, from lobotomy, which had disastrous effects.
1513944	1519244	B	0.743668258190155	And it matters to a system how you affect it.
1519282	1548470	B	0.7597435116767883	And so to know more formally the most effective way to create a desired effect, whatever that might be it's essential that it's not just kind of poking and prodding that is as much as that is part of the scientific method to update that method in accordance with what you're learning is important.
1554010	1555734	D	0.5223822593688965	No, I think you're both right.
1555772	1557058	D	0.7693793773651123	It doesn't have to be dark.
1557154	1562370	D	0.8925309181213379	But also something else that Andrew said about predicting.
1562530	1593220	D	0.769809901714325	I think that's one of also the big goals trying to predict whether to be prepared it couldn't be to control right, but if you can somehow predict how people respond to this or how a system will behave in this other scenario you can change what the input is or prepare for whatever comes, I guess.
1597710	1600474	A	0.9212274551391602	Yeah, a lot of great points.
1600592	1625106	A	0.8684279918670654	Some of the commonly held not equally by everyone, everyone, but some of the tenets of science being to explain predict design and control where explanation and fiction are on the pathway towards systems designing and maintenance and other words that people can add.
1625288	1649626	A	0.8212413191795349	But that's the pragmatic utility oriented view which doesn't have to be an absolutist view but certainly there are regimes of attention socially now and seemingly for long long times where people were wanting to retain and to constrain the variance distribution on what we would say is their generative model.
1649728	1654114	A	0.8681565523147583	Some norm and then other times engaging in these functions.
1654262	1675086	A	0.7524818778038025	And that instrumentalist usage of active inference is like we're going to be able to model it with a pretty minimum framework that's commonly used in statistical systems where some things we observe and some we don't, and at least we know and how all the pieces are connected.
1675278	1695130	A	0.7584340572357178	And then that is an artifact in model based design as people develop that line through time socially, just like probably has been always the case for complex projects and scientific collaboration.
1697630	1700300	A	0.8141871094703674	There's a few other interesting pieces but yeah, please.
1702430	1712042	D	0.5256255269050598	I'm just wondering if now that I'm thinking out loud, isn't that like a problem for confirmation bias?
1712186	1712686	D	0.7360090017318726	Right?
1712788	1715454	D	0.7352538108825684	Like there's a paper in here.
1715492	1730200	D	0.8401820063591003	Here because we create the knowledge and we tell everyone the knowledge this is the model, this is how everything behaves and then we update our knowledge about it and then we look for everything to just confirm it.
1733930	1753580	D	0.7160269618034363	Maybe there's other system that will not let us be getting knowledge so slowly because if everybody just agrees on something we teach it to everyone and we confirm the model and then we just try to look for evidence for that model then we go slowly if there's any better thing or better model that comes along.
1756380	1758040	A	0.7275400161743164	Yeah, a lot to say about that.
1758110	1764044	A	0.8399934768676758	Like if we believe that trees exist or that people exist and then we come to see them.
1764082	1775696	A	0.5021363496780396	So there's kind of this sense where problem confirmation bias which I think is a great term, a great topic to bring in with definitely also what's called like the golden nail syndrome or something.
1775878	1793284	A	0.5823268294334412	If all you have is the hammer then everything is a nail and there's definitely attention there because it's like how much of what you can do are you supposed to do something that you can't do, but then at least you could do what you needed to do to get there.
1793322	1795256	A	0.6754880547523499	So that's actually within your scope of what you can do.
1795278	1801880	A	0.5942021012306213	So it's not that there are things that you can't do that you can't do if just from a measurement perspective.
1802860	1806108	A	0.7871006727218628	So how does it look?
1806194	1835590	A	0.83133465051651	Or how do we recognize across systems or how do we have awareness in situations as limited individuals who do have all of these cognitive phenomena, how to make decisions or sense making or infrastructure or whatever it is the socialness the system of interest of the social sciences make that and then dot, dot, dot normatively what?
1839480	1852570	B	0.7054654359817505	I think there's some protection built into the problem of confirmation bias because all knowledge generation is happening in an open system.
1853180	1885712	B	0.579841673374176	And so there's always going to be an agent outside of your own mind and what it's perceiving that can then challenge or add to the super, the LK 99 semiconductors that has been all the rage recently and how other scientists have now kind of discredited it quite convincingly.
1885776	1903320	B	0.6073532104492188	And it's because of this open they might have had degrees of confirmation bias that they were egging each other on, but it's ultimately been refuted, which is this built in kind of protection because it's all operating in an open system.
1903470	1904440	B	0.4958513081073761	Fortunately.
1908200	1910724	A	0.7389879822731018	Yeah, a lot to say there.
1910922	1935580	A	0.7239477038383484	Monday Morning Reviewer twoing how how do we again go from any given description of a communicative event like the kind of specific unfolding of the LK 99 narrative, as yet uncompleted in the minds of some, which is real enough to be real socially?
1937040	1956850	A	0.8825762271881104	So how do we go from any descriptive anything about that total observation to core screening then how do we come to work with that interface, with whatever that is hands that to us?
1965930	1967990	A	0.8162158727645874	What is the social behavior?
1968730	1984410	A	0.6685597896575928	What are some classic or some novel social behavioral, maybe ones that seem pretty obvious due to recency bias?
1999170	2009710	A	0.8752071857452393	I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the autopoietic nature of information systems.
2010850	2022530	A	0.8663821816444397	Andrew, do you have any thought on this or about where autopoiesis comes into, like, social sciences or these kinds of models?
2024250	2031078	B	0.6230459809303284	Daniel andrew just left a note that he's back.
2031164	2032822	A	0.5502358675003052	He just wasn't looking at the time.
2032956	2034054	A	0.7597541213035583	Funny stuff.
2034252	2036040	A	0.8356776237487793	Anyone else have a thought on that?
2040970	2044282	A	0.7647262215614319	Okay, just just to kind of carry forward then.
2044416	2063778	A	0.7164682745933533	Basically the ability of social systems that include written niche modification, cumulative culture, their increasing extent of control as discussed earlier, that definitely is a bit of an overloaded or at.
2063784	2076006	A	0.6950930953025818	Least doubly meant term in different settings because it can just simply mean modeling it with control theory, which is a pretty limited philosophical statement relative to any statistical method or control.
2076108	2083926	A	0.8072977066040039	Like the kind that people are unhappy with and the kind that's described in Thinking Like a State.
2084108	2095178	A	0.5585669279098511	And a lot of other works that I know Mahault and Lorena and Abel are going to be definitely going into more detail on.
2095264	2132674	A	0.515692949295044	So when societies can model and introspect or self reflect formally much better, and that can happen through anything from free and open source federated protocols, there's many limited formats of self meaning making, but cryptography definitely allows those explorations, and that doesn't necessarily mean computer cryptography.
2132722	2143610	A	0.8703820109367371	That could also be like linguistic encoding and all these other ways of niche sub differentiation in multiscale systems.
2144110	2150170	A	0.7380775213241577	You just do not see a system that is cookie cutter.
2150750	2155066	A	0.7665516138076782	It's very rare in ecosystems.
2155258	2157920	A	0.861876904964447	There are algal blooms and things like that.
2159570	2180258	A	0.8270321488380432	So when we really think about the developmental and the cognitive and the selective niche, which is a concept that Axel Constant and others have differentiated in some of their ecological active inference, like, that niche is very embodied, extended.
2180434	2182770	A	0.7736149430274963	And cultured, et cetera, et cetera.
2182930	2203390	A	0.8385892510414124	It's just like a kind of cool, direct way to open up to that challenge of modeling and just bring some closures with different accounts or compatibilities with different accounts.
2206130	2207662	A	0.7612197399139404	Just to give one random example.
2207716	2210160	A	0.6575344800949097	But maybe it'd be interesting what what other people think.
2211490	2220420	A	0.8740238547325134	All the expressions that people make in social settings can just simply be their expressions or modeled as such.
2221590	2238530	A	0.6905151009559631	That is in one way implicitly what was always in play, but now it's describable and legible and autonomous.
2238610	2261950	A	0.9015401005744934	So how do we take this active inference, collective behavior crossover and think about what it really means in how we're going to be thinking differently, even just this discussion forward or more locally, our understandings with collective behavior or with behavior?
2294040	2297224	B	0.8516092300415039	Daniel, can you ask the question again?
2297342	2301992	B	0.4948813319206238	I didn't actually catch the question.
2302126	2315820	A	0.7093465924263	How do we start to adapt some of these general comments or frames that are in some ways disconnected from descriptions of real systems?
2316240	2322350	A	0.8433606624603271	How do we think about that and what it means now?
2327280	2328284	A	0.5147984027862549	Sorry, go ahead.
2328402	2329330	A	0.7335982322692871	That's okay.
2330500	2333010	B	0.8134600520133972	Do you mean on the document in front of us?
2334420	2338340	B	0.7378343343734741	These disconnected things in front of us, they're on the document.
2340200	2343430	A	0.6874196529388428	I don't know, whatever you think or whatever you want to say.
2345640	2361814	B	0.8409139513969421	Okay, yeah, I again, I hope I'm not fully understanding the question.
2361852	2378810	B	0.6429422497749329	I hope I'm not steering away too much, but I had a general sense of what I think you were saying, and I think it's an enormous problem with the amount of information sharing.
2380430	2399140	B	0.7345482110977173	Just let's just take the generative models of social media and all of the platforms that are available to us, how much information we are privy to in any given moment.
2401990	2422940	B	0.572433352470398	And I'm kind of forgetting the question that you asked, but how do you it's almost as if there is such a high rate of information and data flow that it's really hard to know what to do with all of it.
2424590	2425674	B	0.691457211971283	At least as a human being.
2425712	2430806	B	0.8062615394592285	I'm not saying for machines, but as a psychologist.
2430838	2449200	B	0.5970401167869568	I'm certainly interested in how humans are able to tolerate and respond to the amount and rate of information that's out there.
2462760	2465540	D	0.6436606049537659	This is not the first time this happens, right?
2465610	2477770	D	0.8066484332084656	Like we went from talking to writing information, then everyone wrote their information and then we have books and then we have libraries and that's all available.
2478300	2483992	D	0.6107109785079956	And again, we have access, if you can read right, to all the information in the world.
2484046	2496184	D	0.8376992344856262	So we adapted to, I don't know, to get careers so we could specify in which type of information you are going to know more.
2496322	2503890	D	0.8350784182548523	So maybe we need some sort of new career type, I don't know, more specification with more information.
2504580	2510616	B	0.8771619200706482	But is the rate of information flow and increase?
2510748	2512260	B	0.7868266701698303	Is it not exponential?
2514280	2514932	D	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
2514986	2518212	D	0.694839596748352	It's a crazy amount and our brains cannot do anything about it.
2518346	2524010	D	0.5225334167480469	So we have to do multidisciplinary things and work together with others if we want to make something.
2525100	2530570	D	0.7739041447639465	But yeah, I don't know, maybe we will die of excess of information.
2564220	2585384	A	0.8113304376602173	How do people feel like active inference brings something to the discussion relative to how they want to work towards ants?
2585432	2589484	A	0.6844353675842285	Yeah, well, isn't that the provocative question too?
2589682	2592380	A	0.6686605215072632	But like any system, that's the question.
2592450	2612660	A	0.6702194809913635	Everyone is going to have their own memes and themes and systems that they have spent time with and did field work with and all this other particularity because a system that doesn't have particularity is just not going to be hosting a broad enough niche for phenotypic diversity.
2613640	2621748	A	0.6189022660255432	It's just riding on the edge of a razor instead of more like a fabric that continues to unfold.
2621844	2654102	A	0.7698990702629089	I think there's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference just from what I was reading, trying to find things for this discussion and just I personally wondered what is meaningful or interesting or useful, what's epistemic and pragmatic value for different audiences?
2654166	2678786	A	0.8241481781005859	How does it go from kind of bringing citations that were not linked together in some more theoretical or more generative model oriented work in active inference like epistemic foraging or the infra ants model or any other kind of specific model?
2678888	2686920	A	0.8750150203704834	What do these different kinds of scientific artifacts do for who?
2703960	2723376	B	0.6423304080963135	I guess I'm still learning very crudely ploddling along here, Daniel, to try and answer that because I've quickly realized that the field is so multi nodal.
2723508	2736240	B	0.6771734952926636	It has so much the free energy principle, the Bayesian brain, even just to psychology, has so much applicability.
2736660	2743380	B	0.795487105846405	And everyone I meet at these discussions is coming at it from a different angle.
2744280	2758760	B	0.6520048379898071	And it can be a bit confusing to hear how other people are applying it, how other people are making use of it in all manner of ways.
2758830	2788880	B	0.5426331162452698	And so I'm still learning how to apply to kind of ring fence, the free energy principle and connect it to psychological processes including collective behavior because there's a lot of psychopathology in group think in collective behavior, but I'm also very interested in its application at the interface of what happens between a therapist and a patient.
2790180	2814824	B	0.5406234860420227	I'm often, unlike other professions, who are just by nature of the scientific method, are able to extract a lot more data to work with, to analyze, to, you know, in a in a that's very hard to do.
2814862	2825180	B	0.5813071727752686	I feel very limited other than just making kind of theoretical leaps and inferences about how to apply the free energy principle to psychology.
2827760	2847060	B	0.5174633860588074	I can't have a session with my brain hooked up to an fMRI machine to get data and to see when a patient says boo or bar, that's a spike on the spike trains, which represents surprisal, and we can then solve for that in some way.
2847210	2861370	B	0.5720797777175903	I don't have access to that sort of data flow, so it feels limited, but I'm still learning how to apply it and trying to collaborate with colleagues on the influence group.
2875520	2906848	A	0.6361753344535828	What are people wondering about collective behavior, even if we're totally, of course, not going to address it, but just what are the kinds of things that people what makes you look up collective behavior instead of just behavior or individual behavioral?
2907024	2910760	B	0.6736418604850769	For me, it's about safety and need to belong.
2916380	2931784	D	0.7831878662109375	For me, I think that it depends where you come from and the country you are, but there are places that are more collective, and there are places that are more individualistic.
2931832	2940064	D	0.8027655482292175	And I think mostly non Western countries have a lot of collective behavior and knowledge and spirits already.
2940182	2940656	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2940758	2945840	D	0.7807513475418091	That they already knew these things that we think are new for us.
2945910	2946288	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2946374	2951284	D	0.5805186033248901	How the collective thing works, for example, I don't know.
2951322	2953348	D	0.49298858642578125	You don't make a decision for yourself.
2953514	2955380	D	0.8117061257362366	You make a decision for the group.
2955450	2956256	D	0.7015199065208435	Like marrying.
2956288	2959156	D	0.7469362020492554	You marry because you want an addition.
2959268	2962680	D	0.7740270495414734	You want to interact with someone or other group.
2962750	2967160	D	0.5178764462471008	And that's something that affects the collective, not just you.
2967230	2969400	D	0.6775692105293274	So arranged marriage makes sense.
2969550	2970520	D	0.7895917892456055	Something like that.
2970590	2970920	D	0.5664746165275574	Right.
2970990	2985040	D	0.7646685242652893	So for me, making that distinction about individual collective comes from understanding that, I don't know, there are other places that are already ahead in what collective means in terms of human beings and how to interact.
2985700	2995228	D	0.564358115196228	And the Western world, we have all this individualistic thing, which is very interesting because why do we have the same species?
2995324	3003540	D	0.8450888395309448	And then we have very different approaches of how to understand ourselves in terms of what an individual is and why it matters.
3014580	3015136	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3015238	3033770	A	0.7860819697380066	There's so much loaded on different understandings among people, including even the essence of the social, which is who are people and what is the obligation and how do we view that relationship?
3035500	3038970	A	0.7220717072486877	That's a very deep area.
3039500	3059696	A	0.7172375321388245	Again, the part that just kept returning to me in the lecture and when I was trying to think about how to even reflect part of this very large area is like, what is the adjective doing and what's the reference point by which this is being said in.
3059718	3072880	A	0.5033799409866333	The speech act like people often will dismiss I don't mean to straw people but dismiss collective behavior by saying well, we are explaining individual behavior.
3073040	3080344	A	0.8070464134216309	What are you explaining beyond the nest mates in the colony and then the exterior, that is it.
3080542	3086120	A	0.7239668369293213	And so that can feel like looking at the same thing from two different sides.
3086700	3100220	A	0.873712420463562	And there are different methods, like some methods blur over individuals a lot more like statistical methods that might correspond to demographics and then on the other hand, like more agent based models.
3103040	3115180	A	0.8666142225265503	But how much variability and what shared variability in what general synchronies amongst different quantum reference frames?
3115260	3136730	A	0.8706203103065491	All these nested at least possibilities that are grounded in wanting to explore mathematical and scientific possibilities as the literature of linear regression is full of so many incredible extensions and similar.
3137500	3168390	A	0.7536090612411499	And then I think what the course is even beginning to try to express and what I understand in the works of the other teachers and a lot of your backgrounds and everything like that is where is that moment where it is not only science, because science is not simply the social.
3169400	3183400	A	0.8017436265945435	So science as an activity and then as there's a diffusion away from science, or at least that relationship between social and science is right there in the title.
3183900	3201256	A	0.6870566010475159	Maybe that's kind of like a science major's take but it is itself in a way presenting a dilemma with what science means there and then that's the frame game who's doing social science?
3201448	3204080	A	0.5401474237442017	Who's doing not social science?
3205380	3216660	A	0.8582823276519775	And that's where in the culture I'm sitting in, in the technical side of that it is related to statistics and formality.
3217000	3232520	A	0.8753698468208313	It's the Xkcd comic and the way that formalisms and details are taken as under some regimes of attention basically definitive.
3233900	3239850	A	0.8530622124671936	And yet there's like a yearning and a counterbalancing that's expressed also in many ways.
3243580	3252600	A	0.5516091585159302	And science maybe some people feel like certain social scientific methods that's like not far enough in this dimension and then the others feel like they're too far in this direction.
3253540	3261120	A	0.6088376045227051	But it's like just like that academic field, let alone any other community of diverse agents.
3261270	3270164	A	0.8521012663841248	Of course there's going to be distributions of perspectives at different times and rate.
3270202	3272340	B	0.8139761686325073	Of uptake by those different perspectives.
3275960	3288600	B	0.8181278109550476	Daniel, do you think these first principles would be able to explain why an ant colony exists?
3288940	3293230	B	0.8271231055259705	I know that was your kind of area of interest of study.
3293600	3310432	B	0.8067150712013245	Why an ant colony exists in the way that it does as a operating as a collective and why another animal is able to survive and achieve its.
3310486	3311200	C	0.540903627872467	Goals.
3313780	3323956	B	0.7992212772369385	As an individual only relying on the environment and its actions and sensations to get its needs met and to no doubt minimize its free energy.
3324058	3335400	B	0.838621973991394	But could first principles explain why the one has to survive as a group and the other has to survive or is able to survive under different conditions?
3337420	3340452	A	0.9293456077575684	Yeah, that's a super interesting question.
3340606	3348936	A	0.840324878692627	It's very core to this individuation and multiscale individuation concept.
3349128	3352536	A	0.8407294750213623	Like is the nest mate the individual and then the colony?
3352568	3353432	A	0.8103308081626892	Is the social?
3353586	3356080	A	0.7048758864402771	Because then for sure it's super collaborative.
3356500	3358796	A	0.7928690314292908	Or is the colony the organism?
3358988	3364140	A	0.8686880469322205	And nest mates are tissues and then are they social across colony boundaries?
3364300	3370550	A	0.6093049049377441	Not where I was in Arizona, but they're often friendly across different species and they avoided conflict more often than not.
3371480	3379832	A	0.6798955202102661	And then why does it even matter what's happening on this plot of lands in this area?
3379966	3385124	A	0.6522793769836426	From like a biomimicry perspective, we might learn new algorithms.
3385172	3390816	A	0.5135575532913208	It's a sandbox for learning new techniques and observation, all these other richnesses.
3390868	3399340	A	0.8182616233825684	So it's to say though, what comes away from that science that makes it social science.
3400720	3439080	A	0.6617907285690308	And I think there's a lot of disciplinary ways of understanding that, which I'm definitely not expert in in the professional fields like counseling, but probably in all the different humanities and histories and all these other fields, all these different maps, the kind of social the epistemic organizing question and then the social organizing question and the way that technology is also in that tangle.
3439420	3447756	A	0.6305984258651733	And yeah, someone pointed out like, this is not a new problem, but then it's like, well, what parts are new?
3447858	3452504	A	0.8226105570793152	And then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or too individualist or too collective?
3452552	3453660	A	0.7498393654823303	On what scale?
3454080	3459072	A	0.7571773529052734	What if they're like, really collectivist at this scale, but not at this scale or another?
3459126	3476260	A	0.542485773563385	An example of an ambiguous or at least like polysimus phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation of non reproductive nest mates.
3476680	3484808	A	0.5647818446159363	And that has often been modeled from a position of zero is the law and how are they cheating above this?
3484974	3490768	A	0.8973464369773865	But it's also been approached from a colony level strategic bet hedging.
3490964	3508690	A	0.5206402540206909	So without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics of the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept off the table if it was even that's a very integrated problem.
3509540	3513696	A	0.5867328643798828	So it helps you approach collective systems and learn about them.
3513718	3522580	A	0.5342926979064941	But it's like there's a lot to say about humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture.
3523000	3532680	A	0.546302318572998	And human foraging is a lot more sophisticated from just like a perception, cognition, influence, perspective.
3534300	3541516	A	0.7103480100631714	So those are just some ant related thoughts, but it just centers a lot of discussions that really matter.
3541698	3549870	A	0.7050142288208008	And I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're thought to by some.
3551280	3563104	B	0.6019868850708008	Yeah, and it's very hard to get any kind of cross pollination or to see cross pollination studying one agent.
3563222	3568950	B	0.5563653111457825	It's quite, at least to my mind, very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents.
3569400	3585384	B	0.5401619672775269	It starts getting a bit tricky to infer one collective's how and why and how they survive and how another agent does.
3585422	3586920	B	0.5536863803863525	It's tricky.
3587660	3590260	B	0.8490241169929504	So I'm almost just going to an agent.
3590430	3595870	B	0.5809221267700195	Human beings, as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible.
3598560	3602700	B	0.7289196252822876	Otherwise it's just information overload.
3612180	3624672	A	0.6721240878105164	Body is a complex place too, and digital technology, virtuality, these are such richly developed topics in the social sciences.
3624736	3653340	A	0.9341893196105957	I only know the tiniest amount from but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations and everything, there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths and it's being approached seemingly multiple layers.
3654320	3661340	A	0.8248574137687683	The two layers that just we can focus most narrowly on is like within the realm of science, what is science?
3661840	3669276	A	0.7115236520767212	Which is kind of like playing this other role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems, what is science?
3669308	3670864	A	0.564787745475769	Who gets to decide what social science is?
3670902	3671440	A	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3671510	3677670	A	0.679235577583313	I'm not in social science but it's system of interest to society and certainly I'm a part of that.
3678440	3690100	A	0.768293559551239	So it's like what is good technically, what is social scientific and then what is that social scientific?
3690180	3706590	A	0.8305606842041016	How is that going to interface into the metaphysical questions and the normative ethical and the decision making with trade offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter?
3707920	3734410	A	0.8297855854034424	Also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences, what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior?
3745250	3760750	A	0.8797836899757385	One point that I would have added in to the lecture was just that in distributed systems, whether as modeled or as such, all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals.
3760830	3765430	A	0.8499046564102173	Even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism, it's like all about the local interactions.
3765850	3778762	A	0.8534156084060669	And so that is an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands off layer at least, if not much more.
3778816	3793470	A	0.902276873588562	Another nice feature about them, they are in a way waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain at least two layers of consideration.
3794130	3808846	A	0.9132702946662903	Now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in that way that more arising function can be modeled.
3808958	3815798	A	0.863041341304779	But in either way then you can kind of wrap that two layer system and then compose them.
3815964	3823206	A	0.7375772595405579	So that's like what enables in certain situations like parallelization or at least that's obviously a big area.
3823388	3856418	A	0.5664257407188416	But that's what allows multi agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging sense making and action selection problems, not by guarantee or default because any given slicing and dicing of any given prompting of information may not help you adapt but there are paths that do and don't help, persist or not.
3856584	3863362	A	0.8288179039955139	And that's this kind of persistence starting place that we began with.
3863416	3864290	A	0.7013376355171204	Sasha.
3867920	3888530	E	0.6694030165672302	Yeah, I really resonate with what you mentioned about the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information.
3889220	3931360	E	0.8275249600410461	And it actually makes me think a lot about the psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information about the person's sort of local environment and behavior or perhaps demographics and age, that their informational environment, like a wealth of what kind of information they consume, might also be really telling about their psychological and behavior interactions or pathologies.
3934820	3946020	E	0.8319041132926941	And then to bring it kind of full circle back to that the researcher is part of the ecosystem that they are studying.
3949880	3966750	E	0.6060394048690796	Yeah, I think it's just such a difference in perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that the way that you would design and run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience.
3967120	3985280	E	0.6788040995597839	And so that is a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not like a negative perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying truth or reality.
3987140	3988960	E	0.806232750415802	So, just a few thoughts.
3993700	3994544	A	0.9324204325675964	Very interesting.
3994662	3998370	A	0.8509968519210815	Anyone want to add something?
4004830	4019950	A	0.5434066653251648	I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelt term from ethology behavioral research observation science using the term to describe the world as it is experienced by a particular organism.
4020690	4024734	A	0.8368044495582581	I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of discussion in discourse.
4024862	4043090	A	0.9059290885925293	This is just to give it like a super short overview the world we might connect to world modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different pros focus on qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence.
4043250	4052566	A	0.7402933835983276	World modeling as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones because this is the area of phenomenology.
4052598	4058138	A	0.864865779876709	And so this is like a kind of semi eternal discussion point.
4058304	4079860	A	0.8544776439666748	So whether active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain whereas as it is experienced is going to be a philosophical question and then by a particular organism that specificity we get by actually making the generative model even if we're just speculating about it.
4080630	4092710	A	0.5350378751754761	It's like talking about experience without an experiencer would be like talking about some agent's behavior without reference to its niche.
4094250	4119310	A	0.7013472318649292	And then where there is like that complex negotiation I think the humanities and a lot of the social sciences have identified a lot of the structural top down and also the personal bottom up motifs of things being blurred and made complex.
4120610	4147538	A	0.8491001725196838	And so I think part of the social and the scientific as coming only from the scientific side is like to meet in the third space and or at least make it work to have a mutual compromise where it's like certain social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure that is going to be a judgment call.
4147724	4151494	A	0.8421679139137268	But understanding that conversation, where is it a mutual compromise?
4151622	4153206	A	0.8491690158843994	In what dimensions?
4153398	4158246	A	0.7914235591888428	Not simply along the kind of rigor, accessibility or implications axis.
4158278	4180000	A	0.7139802575111389	There's just very many things in play in these Iterated relationships in ecosystems, having a researcher as part of the ecosystem.
4180500	4183696	A	0.7141081690788269	Well, here's the forager question.
4183798	4186332	A	0.7689894437789917	We see the nest mate on the ground, it's a forager.
4186396	4189360	A	0.6289140582084656	But then we step back, it's like, okay, well, it's foraging.
4190040	4192928	A	0.7475486397743225	And then that's the allocation of the forager.
4193024	4213720	A	0.841292142868042	Then its foraging is still part of this sense making, this generative sense making with process understanding even of a trace, which is something that Bruno Latour and others have explored with, like following a trace in a social setting and using that to trace networks.
4214640	4221550	A	0.5139034390449524	So in our digital ecosystems, though, our information ecosystems is not research happening.
4222800	4225084	A	0.7367520332336426	And so what does that really mean?
4225202	4228480	A	0.6470961570739746	And then what are those social normativities?
4228820	4240660	A	0.6678417325019836	There is going to be like a meeting or a handoff with where that really is happening, or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored.
4242760	4249476	A	0.8685041666030884	Or it could be whatever metaphor in that setting it actually is.
4249658	4254692	A	0.6265450716018677	There's no general metaphor because that'd be like, oh, what's the general metaphor on this experiment?
4254756	4255800	A	0.8014577031135559	Which experiment?
4256700	4259560	A	0.8887463212013245	Just the general action that we plan to take.
4259630	4263290	A	0.5522118806838989	Oh, hard to say.
4288940	4289944	B	0.6268246173858643	It okay.
4289982	4298556	A	0.8885753750801086	Well, in our last sections, I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look at, otherwise, what are any other thoughts?
4298588	4310840	A	0.890895426273346	Or like, what what can we learn more about about collective behavior?
4311280	4316990	A	0.83806312084198	Or what will it mean for our sense making, decision making, if we understand collective behavior better?
4379830	4383320	A	0.6819392442703247	What else are people excited about for the rest of the course?
4390570	4406620	A	0.8894202709197998	Like, based upon the sections that we've done so far and how we can even start to approach this in an acknowledged, limited, finite way?
4408270	4408682	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4408736	4410620	A	0.7536807060241699	Sasha than anyone else.
4413730	4431774	E	0.8430429100990295	I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes, and it makes me think about how, working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour, we're able to kind of leave a stigmagic trace of things we've discussed.
4431902	4440802	E	0.7992317080497742	And what sort of traits or practices should individual humans I guess I should specify humans.
4440946	4446710	E	0.8139557242393494	Should we embody in order to improve cohesion in collective behavior?
4447050	4459130	E	0.8778865337371826	It makes me think of certain psychology traits or descriptions of, like, openness or conscientiousness.
4460690	4470270	E	0.6293602585792542	What will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior?
4476490	4509010	B	0.613177478313446	Yeah, I think to add to that, to just emphasize the importance, again, only with human agents, specifically, who have the capacity to think and reflect, and the only ones that have those really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet, but to really kind of leverage in order to make the collective better.
4509160	4544170	B	0.4947434067726135	There's a responsibility of the individual, despite being part of a collective on many different fronts, to be able to leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned, and to be able to think, to retain the individual's mind and think about the collective, I think is so important if the collective is to become healthier.
4544330	4546394	B	0.7648718357086182	Sasha, to your point, and to improve.
4546442	4547040	C	0.5477328300476074	Its.
4551080	4558090	B	0.5470186471939087	To become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be.
4563710	4572670	B	0.7356426119804382	So to always try and maintain a thinking self is crucial.
4574530	4578640	B	0.5686931610107422	You can very easily be usurped into the collective as is.
4580210	4594946	B	0.5540841817855835	If you just go on any social media platform, you will see individuals rarely thinking for themselves and seemingly kind of just fueling each other.
4594968	4596920	B	0.9413278102874756	And that causes massive problems.
4597610	4604600	B	0.8684943318367004	So an individual mind strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward.
4610250	4612118	A	0.594594419002533	It yeah.
4612204	4623246	A	0.89223712682724	This dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these ongoing negotiated compromise that can be also viewed many ways.
4623348	4634590	A	0.8225749731063843	However, they are cognitive science coming into play.
4636720	4654550	A	0.8934699296951294	Maybe historical processes or philosophies were used in many settings for even approaching these kinds of social questions.
4655720	4667400	A	0.7612563371658325	And now with computer science and technology, it even is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action.
4668460	4683550	A	0.7144491076469421	Not that those are new in and of themselves, but thinking like a state, like the development of the apparatus, the development of the social systems that can be run on open source hardware, open source software, things like that.
4688340	4707590	A	0.7553403973579407	I don't know if something's generalized across all such groups, but understanding what environments, at least initially things are beginning at is just a realist starting point.
4709160	4716810	A	0.6169512867927551	Probably no guarantee since most things, all things are swept off the table in their specifics anyway.
4721580	4741516	A	0.5779191255569458	And how to deal with that kind of like skin on the line type of decision making is very interesting how it's pursued in the sciences because often many runs are presented or that kind of catastrophic failure mode of models is not considered.
4741548	4753540	A	0.8347958326339722	It's just like part of the training, starting naive so just the way that different social considerations are converged upon.
4754200	4761110	A	0.58872389793396	It's not like reduced to one feature of the social because the social is such an open space.
4763820	4778220	A	0.9178540706634521	As a scientist, always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up the situations which are, like, mundane, but also, of course, very deep and meaningful.
4779120	4781580	A	0.7721711993217468	Also, though, mundane.
4819360	4829810	A	0.9138320088386536	Any other thoughts or otherwise on collective behavior or on the social sciences course or anything?
4830340	4834610	A	0.5805738568305969	Otherwise people can have any last words if they want.
4841030	4841442	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4841496	4841858	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4841944	4843726	A	0.9705645442008972	Thank you all for participating.
4843918	4845410	A	0.8726081252098083	David, want to add anything?
4845480	4846210	B	0.5708940029144287	Excellent.
4855690	4856102	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4856156	4861182	A	0.9046229124069214	Well, I look forward to more questions being asked on the course website.
4861316	4866186	A	0.9763052463531494	And everybody's engagement with the course is very much appreciated.
4866298	4868634	A	0.5582836270332336	So keep up the collective.
4868762	4872030	A	0.9873580932617188	Thanks for multiscale learning, and it's a fun course.
4872100	4877070	A	0.9885697960853577	Really happy that we could have done the session and very happy to have concluded the session.
4880050	4881710	A	0.8092430830001831	All right, thank you.
4881780	4882426	B	0.4864290952682495	Bye bye.
4882458	4883290	B	0.6543300151824951	Bern ciao.
