1
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:06,004
Daniel: You.

2
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:09,015
Hello and welcome.

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:11,282
It's August 16, 2023.

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:14,579
We're in the collective behavior

5
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:14,579
discussion section of the active

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:14,579
inference for the Social sciences course

7
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:22,314
in 2023.

8
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:27,803
So perhaps let us all go around and give

9
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:27,803
an opening in introduction and or

10
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:27,803
reflection and see who joins and what

11
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:37,841
happens from there.

12
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:40,149
But just so that everybody has said hello.

13
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:40,149
.

14
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:49,036
Bryn: Hi, everyone.

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:53,403
I'm Brun 09:00 P.m.

16
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,723
In South Africa, and, yeah, just excited

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,943
to be and see what happens.

18
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,270
Andrew: Hi, I'm Andrew.

19
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:12,753
I'm a graduate student in Indiana, and I

20
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:12,753
guess my field of interest now is

21
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:19,416
knowledge management.

22
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:22,740
And I think that figuring out how we

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:22,740
collectively learn and can share

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:22,740
information is a really interesting topic,

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:22,740
, and I'd like to see how this would

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:32,785
apply.

27
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,565
Regina: Hi, I'm Gina, and I'm from

28
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:40,565
Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain,

29
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:40,565
studying and doing experiments related to

30
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:40,565
this topic and trying to learn a little

31
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:40,565
bit of the theory that's behind it so we

32
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:55,105
can advance better.

33
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,118
I'm excited.

34
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:01,101
Sasha: Hello.

35
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,112
My name is Sasha.

36
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,132
I'm calling in from California.

37
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,149
I'm also a graduate student.

38
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:10,194
Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited

39
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:12,215
presentation last week.

40
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,234
I'm looking forward to a discussion.

41
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:20,299
Daniel: All right, well, how about anyone

42
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:20,299
can give a first reflection on collective

43
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:26,357
behavior?

44
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:32,410
What was their thought or context before,

45
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:32,410
and where are they at as we kind of

46
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,451
begin?

47
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:37,463
Yeah, Regina.

48
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:44,531
Regina: Okay, so I just want to make sure

49
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:44,531
that I understand because I took, like,

50
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:50,596
two big lessons from your lesson, right?

51
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:54,634
And the first one is that this famous

52
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:54,634
model of active inference that has the

53
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:54,634
agent and the environment and the Markov

54
00:02:54,634 --> 00:03:05,685
blanket in the middle, right?

55
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,708
And just interacts with everything.

56
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:08,713
Right.

57
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,742
So I think what I got from what you

58
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:11,742
discuss, maybe I didn't have a good

59
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:11,742
definition of an agent, but first, that

60
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:11,742
you can have that agent not be just an

61
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:11,742
individual, but also your definition of

62
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:11,742
an individual changes depending on what

63
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:29,922
you want to study in the behavior.

64
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:29,927
Right.

65
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:33,965
So an agent can be an ant, it can be an

66
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:33,965
ecosystem, it can be an eye looking at

67
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:33,965
something, or it can be as a society, for

68
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:42,051
example.

69
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:44,079
And I think that's a big take for me

70
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,079
because it changes a lot the concept of

71
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,079
how to study things and use active

72
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,079
imprints just by changing how big the

73
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:54,173
agent can be.

74
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:57,201
So I don't know if I got that right.

75
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:59,228
So first, that clarification.

76
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,219
Daniel: So what is an agent?

77
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:11,287
Regina: Yeah, so I don't know if there's,

78
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:11,287
like, a formal definition of an agent in

79
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:14,316
active inference.

80
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,320
Right.

81
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,359
But if we want to study whatever we want,

82
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:18,359
because I'm about study, because I have

83
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:18,359
to do that's, like, my goal, whatever I'm

84
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:27,441
doing.

85
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,469
So I want to study whatever I have to

86
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:29,469
choose what's going to be my agent and

87
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:34,514
the environment it has.

88
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:37,544
So choosing the agent, you can do it to

89
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:37,544
create a model or to make an experiment,

90
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,582
whatever.

91
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:46,629
But the choice you make, it will depend

92
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,629
on what you understand as an individual

93
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:52,690
or as an agent?

94
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,702
I think so.

95
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:54,709
Right.

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:05,764
Daniel: Awesome.

97
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,780
Anyone have a thought on that?

98
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:10,816
Regina: If I continue with something,

99
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:10,816
just to add something else, and this will

100
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:13,844
be my mind.

101
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:18,892
And then I'm thinking, is that also a big

102
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:18,892
problem that we have or I think I have,

103
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:18,892
is that since I am part of the

104
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:18,892
environment, you know, the perspective of

105
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:18,892
whoever is studying whatever it is, it's

106
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:35,061
also going to be an effect in it.

107
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:38,094
So maybe scientists already decided, but

108
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:38,094
I don't know that we can never have an

109
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:38,094
objective way of studying something if

110
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:38,094
you're part of the environment of the

111
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:47,186
agent.

112
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,216
So, I don't know, we already forgot it or

113
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,216
we already decided that's it we cannot

114
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,216
have objective observations of behavior

115
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:56,271
in general.

116
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,299
But you always think about the agent

117
00:05:59,299 --> 00:05:59,299
environment and you studying it as

118
00:05:59,299 --> 00:05:59,299
something else, but something else is

119
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:05,307
also affecting it.

120
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:08,332
So I see that as a problem or maybe

121
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:08,332
something that has to be said, like we

122
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:08,332
are not objective because we're part of

123
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:08,332
what it's affecting our agents in the

124
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:18,432
behavior collectively too.

125
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:21,465
So those are the thoughts I have to share.

126
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:21,465
.

127
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,521
Bryn: Regina, I'm also new to all of this.

128
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:27,521
.

129
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,559
So my preliminary understanding of what

130
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:31,559
is an agent is anything that has any good

131
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:31,559
reason to self evidence and to itself or

132
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:31,559
to survive that doesn't want to dissipate,

133
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:31,559
, that might delineate the boundary of

134
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:48,735
what an agent is.

135
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:53,781
That then sets up the boundaries with

136
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:53,781
which it will, as you describe, start

137
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:53,781
interacting with the world, with the

138
00:06:53,781 --> 00:07:03,829
environment.

139
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:08,870
So if something, as I understand it, if

140
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,870
something has a reason to go on being to

141
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,870
survive, then it is an agent in the world.

142
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,955
.

143
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,001
Regina: Okay, but that agent could be

144
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,010
anything, right?

145
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,035
Is that what you're saying?

146
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:24,037
Right?

147
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:28,070
Like, if he wants to survive, can be an

148
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,070
ant surviving individually or a cell or a

149
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,137
a good that's like a good definition.

150
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:38,179
Okay.

151
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:41,205
Daniel: Yeah.

152
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:42,215
Sasha.

153
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,240
Sasha: Great points.

154
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,260
Regina, so much to say.

155
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:50,295
There something that I have experience

156
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
with as a researcher in biology is

157
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
deciding the kind of the statistics or

158
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
sampling approach to use, whether we're

159
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
taking one cell from one individual or we'

160
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
're taking many cells from many

161
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
individuals, and how to do the statistics

162
00:07:50,295 --> 00:08:14,474
and kind of sampling approach on that.

163
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:17,508
That is an evergreen question that we're

164
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:17,508
always reevaluating to see how to think

165
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:17,508
about the independencies within

166
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:25,581
biological systems.

167
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:31,640
And then another thing that you mentioned

168
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:31,640
was about the individual being part of

169
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,683
the ecosystem.

170
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,709
And that makes me think a lot about

171
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:37,709
complexity science and something that is

172
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:37,709
addressed there in thinking about the

173
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:37,709
interplay of the scientists and what they'

174
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:47,806
're studying.

175
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,847
Yeah, thank you for those points.

176
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:00,871
Bryn: Sasha.

177
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,900
Can sorry, I'm not raising my hand, I'm

178
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,913
just unmuting it.

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:05,929
That's okay.

180
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,949
Can you say a bit more about what you

181
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,964
mean by complexity science?

182
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,105
Daniel: Maybe muted?

183
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:27,141
Oh, can't speak at the moment.

184
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,179
Yeah.

185
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:34,218
Complexity science has looked at agent

186
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:38,249
based modeling as a fundamental tool.

187
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:41,280
John Holland signals and boundaries,

188
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,280
focusing on what from an active inference

189
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,280
side, we might say, as like message

190
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,280
passing or communication for the messages

191
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,280
and then boundaries with the whole

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,280
discussion around the boundaries in the

193
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:56,434
world.

194
00:09:56,435 --> 00:10:00,410
Map territory, map territory fallacy.

195
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:01,427
Map territory fallacy.

196
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:02,437
Fallacy.

197
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:06,472
Doing iterative modeling.

198
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,510
Sasha brought up limited experimental

199
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,510
resources in the scientific setting, and

200
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,510
that's kind of analogous to the limited

201
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,510
energy budget or attentional budget

202
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,510
ultimately, or just decision making

203
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,510
budget of the kinds of active entities

204
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,510
that make sense to model the ones that

205
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:32,730
kind of have those characteristics.

206
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:36,772
This is really the question of what makes

207
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:36,772
something first principles or what are

208
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,806
the first principles?

209
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:44,852
One aspect of it, as brought up is the

210
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,881
censoring of the persistence.

211
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:49,903
So from the outside, that's kind of like

212
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:49,903
an empiricist's view of persistence, like,

213
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:52,935
, is it measurable?

214
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:55,963
But not saying that something is

215
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:55,963
necessarily that which is the statistical

216
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:55,963
tool, and then the sort of like inside

217
00:10:55,963 --> 00:11:03,985
out implementation type.

218
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,038
But there's a lot more to say in that.

219
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:13,082
Who wants to bring in some new angle or

220
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:17,124
how do they see collective behavior?

221
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,147
Why do we talk about collective

222
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,152
behavior?

223
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:25,203
Why not just behavior, recognize that

224
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:25,203
behavior is multiscale or is social, what'

225
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:25,203
's really being communicated with the

226
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:34,293
collective?

227
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,417
Regina: I believe that we chose those

228
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:46,417
levels so we can make it more simple for

229
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:51,459
our brains to understand it.

230
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,488
Because if we talk about collective

231
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:53,488
behavior, actually is the universe

232
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:53,488
behaving and the particles and everything,

233
00:11:53,488 --> 00:12:00,495
, right?

234
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,526
So I don't know if that's a little bit

235
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
just based on I don't know what's the

236
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
word, like, just the material world and

237
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
how it physically moves and that's like

238
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:13,627
deterministic or whatever, right?

239
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,659
But I think us, we chose to have those

240
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:16,659
limitations so we could understand the

241
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:16,659
world, but also we should acknowledge

242
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:16,659
that our limited because we're part of

243
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:26,756
the system.

244
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:33,819
Andrew: I'm having a little trouble on my

245
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:33,819
kind of understanding, I guess, where the

246
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:33,819
schism lies between kind of the Markov

247
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:33,819
blanket and the umwelt in semiotics of

248
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:48,977
the animals sensory experience.

249
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:02,050
Anyone have maybe someone could Daniel,

250
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,050
do you know the difference between that

251
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,100
two?

252
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:09,127
Daniel: Can you be a little louder?

253
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:10,137
Thank you, though.

254
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:11,143
Andrew?

255
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:12,159
Anyone have a thought on that?

256
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,195
I'll bring in a definition of then and

257
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,207
then we can see.

258
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:19,229
But meanwhile, does anyone have a.

259
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:22,254
Regina: Sorry.

260
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,276
Daniel: Sorry, I was just muted on zoom.

261
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:27,302
Andrew, you're a little quiet, but I'm

262
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:27,302
going to bring in a definition of umvelt

263
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:27,302
and then meanwhile, does anyone have a

264
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:33,362
thought?

265
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:50,535
Bryn: I hope I'm not further diluting

266
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
Andrew's question, but I think of

267
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
collective behavior in kind of like, I

268
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
don't know, a football team or a soccer

269
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
team and what that provides the group who

270
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
shares some common ethos and what that

271
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
does to the how that regulates their

272
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
collective or individual and collective

273
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
free energies during a match or

274
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:50,535
throughout the season, and how that gives

275
00:13:50,535 --> 00:14:39,965
some charge to some investment.

276
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:44,011
Because it's my team against yours, and

277
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,038
we have to try and win.

278
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,079
And so without that collective behavior,

279
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,079
it might be far harder to achieve a group'

280
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,079
's goals if they aren't able to

281
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,079
collaborate and share implicitly and

282
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,079
explicitly certain traits, behaviors,

283
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,079
thoughts, feelings, ideals, ideologies,

284
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,079
whatever they might be, and how that then

285
00:14:51,079 --> 00:15:17,282
allows us to compete in the world.

286
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,347
Regina: I see what you're saying.

287
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:25,364
It's brain.

288
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:27,387
Bryn: Yes, okay.

289
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:29,402
Regina: I see what you're saying.

290
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:31,428
Especially because we're watching the

291
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:32,437
World Cup, right?

292
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:34,452
Women's World Cup.

293
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:35,468
Yeah.

294
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,484
So it's very relevant.

295
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:41,524
But I see that in all the things you've

296
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:41,524
said, it seems that for you, behavior

297
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:47,583
needs to have like a goal.

298
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:50,615
And I don't know if I agree with that.

299
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,644
It's either survival or winning.

300
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,679
But maybe for me, it's just something

301
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:57,679
that happens and maybe the consequence is

302
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:57,679
surviving, but it's not the goal to

303
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:04,695
survive or to win the game.

304
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,718
I mean, in the football it is, right?

305
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:11,767
But in general, maybe there's no goal to

306
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:11,767
the behavior collectively, just the

307
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:17,823
thoughts.

308
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:19,841
Bryn: It's interesting.

309
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,886
Daniel: Yeah, a lot of great comments.

310
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,917
Well, the paper of Connor Hines at all on

311
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:26,917
the collective behavior as surprise

312
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:26,917
minimization that points the way towards

313
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:26,917
using the act infontology these kinds of

314
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:26,917
modeling approaches for collective

315
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:26,917
behavioral situations and really just

316
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:26,917
recognizing them as a certain type of

317
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:45,105
behavioral modeling.

318
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:49,143
The simplest case might just be a single

319
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:49,143
closed system, all part of the

320
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:49,143
composition that leads to the ability to

321
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:49,143
describe at very least a lot of different

322
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:49,143
kinds of systems, just like a linear

323
00:16:49,143 --> 00:17:06,256
model can describe a lot of systems.

324
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:09,289
So then it's also really interesting a

325
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
topic that came up in one of the recent

326
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
textbook groups with what's normative

327
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
about active inference, because the term

328
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
of the process theory, even of active

329
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
inference being normative is mentioned

330
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:28,473
multiple times.

331
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:31,500
And that's definitely a topic that

332
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,526
connects to the social sciences.

333
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:37,561
One can imagine the kind of niche

334
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:37,561
normativity or niche regularities in a

335
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:37,561
broad sense and then the real minute

336
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:37,561
particulars of how they play out, which

337
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:37,561
kind of hints at the kind of descriptive

338
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:37,561
or causal minimum to start making some

339
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:37,561
anything but toy specific generative

340
00:17:37,561 --> 00:18:01,745
models.

341
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:09,824
So it's been an interesting theme to see,

342
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
even already in Abel's and Ben's lectures

343
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
and discussions this question between

344
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
description process of describing which

345
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
is what I associated with Professor

346
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
Gordon's approach to ant watching how

347
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
that descriptive process which is what we

348
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
can say that we have for active inference,

349
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
, just like a linear modeling ecosystem

350
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
could say about their linear modeling in

351
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
principle, and how to then articulate the

352
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
normativities of the framework, if that

353
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
concept, if that separation can even

354
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
exist from the behavioral normativities

355
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
that include the basis of social fabric

356
00:18:09,824 --> 00:19:12,039
in all different kinds of communities.

357
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,084
Here's another question.

358
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:02,083
So what is the role of any technical

359
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,083
detail in the social sciences, whether

360
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,083
more on the statistical connecting with

361
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,083
data or more category theoretic, like

362
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:18,099
just formal?

363
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,104
What's the role of formal methods in

364
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:23,104
different kinds of academic or practical

365
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:31,112
expressions about social systems.

366
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:42,123
Does it matter at all how we think about

367
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,125
a framework at all?

368
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:51,132
Andrew: Well, for formalizing aspects of

369
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:51,132
a social system, I would say that the

370
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:51,132
purpose is for communication between

371
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:51,132
individuals because just we can't verify

372
00:20:51,132 --> 00:21:06,141
that.

373
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,144
Well, formalizing it is just setting a

374
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,147
system on top of what you're observing.

375
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,152
But there is no explicit guarantee what

376
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:17,152
you're saying encompasses everything of

377
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:23,158
the phenomena you're observing.

378
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,159
And.

379
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,164
Bryn: Just.

380
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,169
Andrew: Kind of going back to Taoism of

381
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
the name that can be named is not the

382
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,173
true eternal name.

383
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:43,178
And so it's just a way of it's a slice of

384
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:46,181
what we can observe.

385
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:51,186
And maybe you can make predictions or

386
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
maybe you can generate something that

387
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
acts like the phenomena you're observing.

388
00:21:51,186 --> 00:22:00,189
.

389
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:07,196
It's a way to kind of it's just a way to

390
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:07,196
kind of approximate our understanding of

391
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:13,202
some phenomena.

392
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:16,205
And you have to slice it in a specific

393
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
way, but also understanding that it is a

394
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
slice or it is a tangent line that you're

395
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
approximating as opposed to encompassing

396
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:27,216
the whole system from verbalizing it.

397
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:37,225
Regina: I will add maybe it's not the

398
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:37,225
goal but something that happens out of

399
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:40,229
describing any system.

400
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:45,234
Like Andrew said, it's like the goal to

401
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
modify it or to corrupt it in some way to

402
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:53,242
gain control or whatever.

403
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:56,245
If you know the model, you know how to

404
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,246
play the game, kind of.

405
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,244
So you write instructions and try to see

406
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:05,248
if you can outsmart someone else.

407
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:07,250
I mean, it sounds kind of dark, right?

408
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,253
But maybe it's one of the goals too, or

409
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
something that just happens out of

410
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
knowing the rules that nobody else knows.

411
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:14,257
.

412
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:22,265
Andrew: I guess when you talk about

413
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
control, there is a shade that can be

414
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:29,272
gained from that specific wording.

415
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:32,275
But control in terms of control theory or

416
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:32,275
that comes from electrical engineering

417
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:32,275
and it's really just what shapes the

418
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:32,275
behavior or what are the inputs that

419
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:43,286
drive the behavior.

420
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:46,289
And when you're talking about control, it'

421
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:46,289
's really just about well, if you change

422
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:46,289
these inputs, how does that change the

423
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:51,294
end behavior?

424
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:55,298
And so you can actually from electrical

425
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
engineering of control in some sort of

426
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
electromechanical system, but then you

427
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
can make analogous statements on control

428
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
into society which doesn't necessarily

429
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
mean the dark negative control, but maybe

430
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
there's some pathological behavior in a

431
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
society or even pathological pathological

432
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:55,298
responses within the brain and it's like,

433
00:23:55,298 --> 00:24:28,325
well, what is driving that?

434
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:32,329
And is it possible to change the drivers

435
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:32,329
of that to have something that is more

436
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:39,336
beneficial to the system?

437
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:51,348
Bryn: Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's

438
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
saying, because it matters how you

439
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
manipulate a system or it matters how you

440
00:24:51,348 --> 00:25:04,355
affect a brain.

441
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:05,356
So it cannot be random.

442
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,359
I mean, we've come a long way, for

443
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
example, from lobotomy, which had

444
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,364
disastrous effects.

445
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:18,369
And it matters to a system how you affect

446
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:19,370
it.

447
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,373
And so to know more formally the most

448
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
effective way to create a desired effect,

449
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
whatever that might be it's essential

450
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
that it's not just kind of poking and

451
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
prodding that is as much as that is part

452
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
of the scientific method to update that

453
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
method in accordance with what you're

454
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:48,399
learning is important.

455
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:55,406
Regina: No, I think you're both right.

456
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,408
It doesn't have to be dark.

457
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:00,405
But also something else that Andrew said

458
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,407
about predicting.

459
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:06,411
I think that's one of also the big goals

460
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
trying to predict whether to be prepared

461
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
it couldn't be to control right, but if

462
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
you can somehow predict how people

463
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
respond to this or how a system will

464
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
behave in this other scenario you can

465
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
change what the input is or prepare for

466
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:33,438
whatever comes, I guess.

467
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:40,445
Daniel: Yeah, a lot of great points.

468
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:44,449
Some of the commonly held not equally by

469
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
everyone, everyone, but some of the

470
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
tenets of science being to explain

471
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
predict design and control where

472
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
explanation and fiction are on the

473
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
pathway towards systems designing and

474
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
maintenance and other words that people

475
00:26:44,449 --> 00:27:05,464
can add.

476
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:08,467
But that's the pragmatic utility oriented

477
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
view which doesn't have to be an

478
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
absolutist view but certainly there are

479
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
regimes of attention socially now and

480
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
seemingly for long long times where

481
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
people were wanting to retain and to

482
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
constrain the variance distribution on

483
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
what we would say is their generative

484
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:29,488
model.

485
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:32,491
Some norm and then other times engaging

486
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,493
in these functions.

487
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:37,496
And that instrumentalist usage of active

488
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
inference is like we're going to be able

489
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
to model it with a pretty minimum

490
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
framework that's commonly used in

491
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
statistical systems where some things we

492
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
observe and some we don't, and at least

493
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
we know and how all the pieces are

494
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:55,514
connected.

495
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:59,517
And then that is an artifact in model

496
00:27:59,517 --> 00:27:59,517
based design as people develop that line

497
00:27:59,517 --> 00:27:59,517
through time socially, just like probably

498
00:27:59,517 --> 00:27:59,517
has been always the case for complex

499
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:15,528
projects and scientific collaboration.

500
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,532
There's a few other interesting pieces

501
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,533
but yeah, please.

502
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:26,538
Regina: I'm just wondering if now that I'

503
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:26,538
'm thinking out loud, isn't that like a

504
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:32,545
problem for confirmation bias?

505
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:32,545
Right?

506
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,548
Like there's a paper in here.

507
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,551
Here because we create the knowledge and

508
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
we tell everyone the knowledge this is

509
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
the model, this is how everything behaves

510
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
and then we update our knowledge about it

511
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
and then we look for everything to just

512
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:50,563
confirm it.

513
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
Maybe there's other system that will not

514
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
let us be getting knowledge so slowly

515
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
because if everybody just agrees on

516
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
something we teach it to everyone and we

517
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
confirm the model and then we just try to

518
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
look for evidence for that model then we

519
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
go slowly if there's any better thing or

520
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:13,580
better model that comes along.

521
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,585
Daniel: Yeah, a lot to say about that.

522
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,587
Like if we believe that trees exist or

523
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:20,587
that people exist and then we come to see

524
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:24,591
them.

525
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,593
So there's kind of this sense where

526
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:26,593
problem confirmation bias which I think

527
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:26,593
is a great term, a great topic to bring

528
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:26,593
in with definitely also what's called

529
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:26,593
like the golden nail syndrome or

530
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:35,602
something.

531
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,605
If all you have is the hammer then

532
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
everything is a nail and there's

533
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
definitely attention there because it's

534
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
like how much of what you can do are you

535
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
supposed to do something that you can't

536
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
do, but then at least you could do what

537
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:53,620
you needed to do to get there.

538
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,621
So that's actually within your scope of

539
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,622
what you can do.

540
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:57,624
So it's not that there are things that

541
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
you can't do that you can't do if just

542
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:01,622
from a measurement perspective.

543
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:06,627
So how does it look?

544
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:09,630
Or how do we recognize across systems or

545
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
how do we have awareness in situations as

546
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
limited individuals who do have all of

547
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
these cognitive phenomena, how to make

548
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
decisions or sense making or

549
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
infrastructure or whatever it is the

550
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
socialness the system of interest of the

551
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
social sciences make that and then dot,

552
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:35,656
dot, dot normatively what?

553
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,663
Bryn: I think there's some protection

554
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
built into the problem of confirmation

555
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
bias because all knowledge generation is

556
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:52,673
happening in an open system.

557
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:57,678
And so there's always going to be an

558
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
agent outside of your own mind and what

559
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
it's perceiving that can then challenge

560
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
or add to the super, the LK 99

561
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
semiconductors that has been all the rage

562
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
recently and how other scientists have

563
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
now kind of discredited it quite

564
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:25,700
convincingly.

565
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,703
And it's because of this open they might

566
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:28,703
have had degrees of confirmation bias

567
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:28,703
that they were egging each other on, but

568
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:28,703
it's ultimately been refuted, which is

569
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:28,703
this built in kind of protection because

570
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:43,718
it's all operating in an open system.

571
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:44,719
Fortunately.

572
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:50,725
Daniel: Yeah, a lot to say there.

573
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:54,729
Monday Morning Reviewer twoing how how do

574
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
we again go from any given description of

575
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
a communicative event like the kind of

576
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
specific unfolding of the LK 99 narrative,

577
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
, as yet uncompleted in the minds of some,

578
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
, which is real enough to be real

579
00:31:54,729 --> 00:32:15,744
socially?

580
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,749
So how do we go from any descriptive

581
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
anything about that total observation to

582
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
core screening then how do we come to

583
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
work with that interface, with whatever

584
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:36,765
that is hands that to us?

585
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,776
What is the social behavior?

586
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:53,782
What are some classic or some novel

587
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:53,782
social behavioral, maybe ones that seem

588
00:32:53,782 --> 00:33:04,787
pretty obvious due to recency bias?

589
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:22,805
I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew

590
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:22,805
and I have also talked about is the

591
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:22,805
autopoietic nature of information systems.

592
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:29,812
.

593
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:34,817
Andrew, do you have any thought on this

594
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:34,817
or about where autopoiesis comes into,

595
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:34,817
like, social sciences or these kinds of

596
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:42,825
models?

597
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:49,832
Bryn: Daniel andrew just left a note that

598
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:51,834
he's back.

599
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,835
Daniel: He just wasn't looking at the

600
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:52,835
time.

601
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:54,837
Funny stuff.

602
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:56,838
Anyone else have a thought on that?

603
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:03,840
Okay, just just to kind of carry forward

604
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,841
then.

605
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:08,845
Basically the ability of social systems

606
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
that include written niche modification,

607
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
cumulative culture, their increasing

608
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
extent of control as discussed earlier,

609
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
that definitely is a bit of an overloaded

610
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:23,860
or at.

611
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,862
Least doubly meant term in different

612
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:25,862
settings because it can just simply mean

613
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:25,862
modeling it with control theory, which is

614
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:25,862
a pretty limited philosophical statement

615
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:25,862
relative to any statistical method or

616
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:36,872
control.

617
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,876
Like the kind that people are unhappy

618
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:39,876
with and the kind that's described in

619
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:43,880
Thinking Like a State.

620
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:47,884
And a lot of other works that I know

621
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:47,884
Mahault and Lorena and Abel are going to

622
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:55,892
be definitely going into more detail on.

623
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:58,895
So when societies can model and

624
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
introspect or self reflect formally much

625
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
better, and that can happen through

626
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
anything from free and open source

627
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
federated protocols, there's many limited

628
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
formats of self meaning making, but

629
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
cryptography definitely allows those

630
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
explorations, and that doesn't

631
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:32,923
necessarily mean computer cryptography.

632
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,926
That could also be like linguistic

633
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:35,926
encoding and all these other ways of

634
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:35,926
niche sub differentiation in multiscale

635
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:43,934
systems.

636
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,939
You just do not see a system that is

637
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,941
cookie cutter.

638
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,946
It's very rare in ecosystems.

639
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,948
There are algal blooms and things like

640
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:57,948
that.

641
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,947
So when we really think about the

642
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
developmental and the cognitive and the

643
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
selective niche, which is a concept that

644
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
Axel Constant and others have

645
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
differentiated in some of their

646
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
ecological active inference, like, that

647
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:20,965
niche is very embodied, extended.

648
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,967
And cultured, et cetera, et cetera.

649
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:27,972
It's just like a kind of cool, direct way

650
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:27,972
to open up to that challenge of modeling

651
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:27,972
and just bring some closures with

652
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:27,972
different accounts or compatibilities

653
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:43,988
with different accounts.

654
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:47,992
Just to give one random example.

655
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:49,994
But maybe it'd be interesting what what

656
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:50,995
other people think.

657
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:54,999
All the expressions that people make in

658
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
social settings can just simply be their

659
00:36:54,999 --> 00:37:00,999
expressions or modeled as such.

660
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,006
That is in one way implicitly what was

661
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:07,006
always in play, but now it's describable

662
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:18,017
and legible and autonomous.

663
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:22,021
So how do we take this active inference,

664
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,021
collective behavior crossover and think

665
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,021
about what it really means in how we're

666
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,021
going to be thinking differently, even

667
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,021
just this discussion forward or more

668
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,021
locally, our understandings with

669
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:41,040
collective behavior or with behavior?

670
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:16,069
Bryn: Daniel, can you ask the question

671
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:17,070
again?

672
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,074
I didn't actually catch the question.

673
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:25,078
Daniel: How do we start to adapt some of

674
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:25,078
these general comments or frames that are

675
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:25,078
in some ways disconnected from

676
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:35,088
descriptions of real systems?

677
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:40,093
How do we think about that and what it

678
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:42,095
means now?

679
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,101
Sorry, go ahead.

680
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,102
That's okay.

681
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:52,105
Bryn: Do you mean on the document in

682
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:53,105
front of us?

683
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,109
These disconnected things in front of us,

684
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:58,111
they're on the document.

685
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,109
Daniel: I don't know, whatever you think

686
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,110
or whatever you want to say.

687
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:14,121
Bryn: Okay, yeah, I again, I hope I'm not

688
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:21,128
fully understanding the question.

689
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:25,132
I hope I'm not steering away too much,

690
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
but I had a general sense of what I think

691
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
you were saying, and I think it's an

692
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
enormous problem with the amount of

693
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:38,145
information sharing.

694
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:44,151
Just let's just take the generative

695
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:44,151
models of social media and all of the

696
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:44,151
platforms that are available to us, how

697
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:44,151
much information we are privy to in any

698
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:59,166
given moment.

699
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:06,167
And I'm kind of forgetting the question

700
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:06,167
that you asked, but how do you it's

701
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:06,167
almost as if there is such a high rate of

702
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:06,167
information and data flow that it's

703
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:06,167
really hard to know what to do with all

704
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:22,183
of it.

705
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:25,186
At least as a human being.

706
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:29,190
I'm not saying for machines, but as a

707
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,191
psychologist.

708
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:36,197
I'm certainly interested in how humans

709
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:36,197
are able to tolerate and respond to the

710
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:36,197
amount and rate of information that's out

711
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:49,210
there.

712
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:04,219
Regina: This is not the first time this

713
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:05,220
happens, right?

714
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,223
Like we went from talking to writing

715
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:08,223
information, then everyone wrote their

716
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:08,223
information and then we have books and

717
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:08,223
then we have libraries and that's all

718
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:17,232
available.

719
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:20,235
And again, we have access, if you can

720
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
read right, to all the information in the

721
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,238
world.

722
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,242
So we adapted to, I don't know, to get

723
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:27,242
careers so we could specify in which type

724
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:27,242
of information you are going to know more.

725
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:36,251
.

726
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:39,254
So maybe we need some sort of new career

727
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:39,254
type, I don't know, more specification

728
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:43,258
with more information.

729
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:49,264
Bryn: But is the rate of information flow

730
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:50,265
and increase?

731
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:52,267
Is it not exponential?

732
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:54,269
Regina: I don't know.

733
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:57,272
It's a crazy amount and our brains cannot

734
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:58,273
do anything about it.

735
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,269
So we have to do multidisciplinary things

736
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
and work together with others if we want

737
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:04,273
to make something.

738
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,277
But yeah, I don't know, maybe we will die

739
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:10,279
of excess of information.

740
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:50,319
Daniel: How do people feel like active

741
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:50,319
inference brings something to the

742
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:50,319
discussion relative to how they want to

743
00:42:50,319 --> 00:43:05,328
work towards ants?

744
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:08,331
Yeah, well, isn't that the provocative

745
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:09,332
question too?

746
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:12,335
But like any system, that's the question.

747
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
.

748
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:15,338
Everyone is going to have their own memes

749
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
and themes and systems that they have

750
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
spent time with and did field work with

751
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
and all this other particularity because

752
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
a system that doesn't have particularity

753
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
is just not going to be hosting a broad

754
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:32,355
enough niche for phenotypic diversity.

755
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:36,359
It's just riding on the edge of a razor

756
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:36,359
instead of more like a fabric that

757
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,364
continues to unfold.

758
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:46,369
I think there's a lot of work to do with

759
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,369
the social sciences and active inference

760
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,369
just from what I was reading, trying to

761
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,369
find things for this discussion and just

762
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,369
I personally wondered what is meaningful

763
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,369
or interesting or useful, what's

764
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,369
epistemic and pragmatic value for

765
00:43:46,369 --> 00:44:14,391
different audiences?

766
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:17,394
How does it go from kind of bringing

767
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
citations that were not linked together

768
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
in some more theoretical or more

769
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
generative model oriented work in active

770
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
inference like epistemic foraging or the

771
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
infra ants model or any other kind of

772
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:38,415
specific model?

773
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:42,419
What do these different kinds of

774
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:46,423
scientific artifacts do for who?

775
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:08,439
Bryn: I guess I'm still learning very

776
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
crudely ploddling along here, Daniel, to

777
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
try and answer that because I've quickly

778
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
realized that the field is so multi nodal.

779
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:23,454
.

780
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:28,459
It has so much the free energy principle,

781
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:28,459
the Bayesian brain, even just to

782
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:36,467
psychology, has so much applicability.

783
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:40,470
And everyone I meet at these discussions

784
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,474
is coming at it from a different angle.

785
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:48,479
And it can be a bit confusing to hear how

786
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:48,479
other people are applying it, how other

787
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:48,479
people are making use of it in all manner

788
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:58,489
of ways.

789
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,487
And so I'm still learning how to apply to

790
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
kind of ring fence, the free energy

791
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
principle and connect it to psychological

792
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
processes including collective behavior

793
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
because there's a lot of psychopathology

794
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
in group think in collective behavior,

795
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
but I'm also very interested in its

796
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
application at the interface of what

797
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
happens between a therapist and a patient.

798
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:28,513
.

799
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:35,520
I'm often, unlike other professions, who

800
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,520
are just by nature of the scientific

801
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,520
method, are able to extract a lot more

802
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,520
data to work with, to analyze, to, you

803
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:54,539
know, in a in a that's very hard to do.

804
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:57,542
I feel very limited other than just

805
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:57,542
making kind of theoretical leaps and

806
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:57,542
inferences about how to apply the free

807
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:05,544
energy principle to psychology.

808
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:10,549
I can't have a session with my brain

809
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
hooked up to an fMRI machine to get data

810
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
and to see when a patient says boo or bar,

811
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
, that's a spike on the spike trains,

812
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
which represents surprisal, and we can

813
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:27,566
then solve for that in some way.

814
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:30,569
I don't have access to that sort of data

815
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
flow, so it feels limited, but I'm still

816
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
learning how to apply it and trying to

817
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
collaborate with colleagues on the

818
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:41,580
influence group.

819
00:47:55,594 --> 00:48:00,593
Daniel: What are people wondering about

820
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:00,593
collective behavior, even if we're

821
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:00,593
totally, of course, not going to address

822
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:00,593
it, but just what are the kinds of things

823
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:00,593
that people what makes you look up

824
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:00,593
collective behavior instead of just

825
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:26,619
behavior or individual behavioral?

826
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,622
Bryn: For me, it's about safety and need

827
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:30,623
to belong.

828
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:39,632
Regina: For me, I think that it depends

829
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:39,632
where you come from and the country you

830
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:39,632
are, but there are places that are more

831
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:39,632
collective, and there are places that are

832
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:51,644
more individualistic.

833
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:54,647
And I think mostly non Western countries

834
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:54,647
have a lot of collective behavior and

835
00:48:54,647 --> 00:49:00,647
knowledge and spirits already.

836
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:00,647
Right.

837
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,650
That they already knew these things that

838
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,652
we think are new for us.

839
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:06,653
Right.

840
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:09,656
How the collective thing works, for

841
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,658
example, I don't know.

842
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,660
You don't make a decision for yourself.

843
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,662
You make a decision for the group.

844
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:16,663
Like marrying.

845
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,666
You marry because you want an addition.

846
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,668
You want to interact with someone or

847
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:22,669
other group.

848
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,672
And that's something that affects the

849
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,674
collective, not just you.

850
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,676
So arranged marriage makes sense.

851
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:30,677
Something like that.

852
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:30,677
Right.

853
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,680
So for me, making that distinction about

854
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
individual collective comes from

855
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
understanding that, I don't know, there

856
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
are other places that are already ahead

857
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
in what collective means in terms of

858
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:45,691
human beings and how to interact.

859
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:48,695
And the Western world, we have all this

860
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:48,695
individualistic thing, which is very

861
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:48,695
interesting because why do we have the

862
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:55,702
same species?

863
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,704
And then we have very different

864
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:57,704
approaches of how to understand ourselves

865
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:57,704
in terms of what an individual is and why

866
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:03,704
it matters.

867
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:15,716
Daniel: Yes.

868
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:18,719
There's so much loaded on different

869
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:18,719
understandings among people, including

870
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:18,719
even the essence of the social, which is

871
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:18,719
who are people and what is the obligation

872
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:33,734
and how do we view that relationship?

873
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:38,739
That's a very deep area.

874
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,743
Again, the part that just kept returning

875
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
to me in the lecture and when I was

876
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
trying to think about how to even reflect

877
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
part of this very large area is like,

878
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
what is the adjective doing and what's

879
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
the reference point by which this is

880
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:59,760
being said in.

881
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,757
The speech act like people often will

882
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
dismiss I don't mean to straw people but

883
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
dismiss collective behavior by saying

884
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
well, we are explaining individual

885
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:12,767
behavior.

886
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:16,771
What are you explaining beyond the nest

887
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
mates in the colony and then the exterior,

888
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:20,775
, that is it.

889
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:23,778
And so that can feel like looking at the

890
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:26,781
same thing from two different sides.

891
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:29,784
And there are different methods, like

892
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
some methods blur over individuals a lot

893
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
more like statistical methods that might

894
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
correspond to demographics and then on

895
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
the other hand, like more agent based

896
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:40,795
models.

897
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:46,801
But how much variability and what shared

898
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:46,801
variability in what general synchronies

899
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:46,801
amongst different quantum reference

900
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:55,810
frames?

901
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,814
All these nested at least possibilities

902
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
that are grounded in wanting to explore

903
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
mathematical and scientific possibilities

904
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
as the literature of linear regression is

905
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
full of so many incredible extensions and

906
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:16,825
similar.

907
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:21,830
And then I think what the course is even

908
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
beginning to try to express and what I

909
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
understand in the works of the other

910
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
teachers and a lot of your backgrounds

911
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
and everything like that is where is that

912
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
moment where it is not only science,

913
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
because science is not simply the social.

914
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:48,857
.

915
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:52,861
So science as an activity and then as

916
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:52,861
there's a diffusion away from science, or

917
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:52,861
at least that relationship between social

918
00:52:52,861 --> 00:53:03,866
and science is right there in the title.

919
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:07,870
Maybe that's kind of like a science major'

920
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:07,870
's take but it is itself in a way

921
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:07,870
presenting a dilemma with what science

922
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:07,870
means there and then that's the frame

923
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:21,884
game who's doing social science?

924
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:24,887
Who's doing not social science?

925
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:28,891
And that's where in the culture I'm

926
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:28,891
sitting in, in the technical side of that

927
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:28,891
it is related to statistics and formality.

928
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:36,899
.

929
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:41,904
It's the Xkcd comic and the way that

930
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
formalisms and details are taken as under

931
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
some regimes of attention basically

932
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:52,915
definitive.

933
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:56,919
And yet there's like a yearning and a

934
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
counterbalancing that's expressed also in

935
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:59,922
many ways.

936
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,922
And science maybe some people feel like

937
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
certain social scientific methods that's

938
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
like not far enough in this dimension and

939
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
then the others feel like they're too far

940
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:12,929
in this direction.

941
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,933
But it's like just like that academic

942
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:16,933
field, let alone any other community of

943
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:21,938
diverse agents.

944
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:24,941
Of course there's going to be

945
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:24,941
distributions of perspectives at

946
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:30,947
different times and rate.

947
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:31,948
Bryn: Of uptake by those different

948
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:32,949
perspectives.

949
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:40,957
Daniel, do you think these first

950
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
principles would be able to explain why

951
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:48,965
an ant colony exists?

952
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:51,968
I know that was your kind of area of

953
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:53,970
interest of study.

954
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:58,975
Why an ant colony exists in the way that

955
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
it does as a operating as a collective

956
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
and why another animal is able to survive

957
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:10,981
and achieve its.

958
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:11,982
Andrew: Goals.

959
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:16,987
Bryn: As an individual only relying on

960
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:16,987
the environment and its actions and

961
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:16,987
sensations to get its needs met and to no

962
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:23,994
doubt minimize its free energy.

963
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:26,997
But could first principles explain why

964
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:26,997
the one has to survive as a group and the

965
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:26,997
other has to survive or is able to

966
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:35,006
survive under different conditions?

967
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:39,010
Daniel: Yeah, that's a super interesting

968
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,011
question.

969
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:45,016
It's very core to this individuation and

970
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:48,019
multiscale individuation concept.

971
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,022
Like is the nest mate the individual and

972
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:52,023
then the colony?

973
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:53,024
Is the social?

974
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:55,026
Because then for sure it's super

975
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:56,027
collaborative.

976
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:58,029
Or is the colony the organism?

977
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:01,026
And nest mates are tissues and then are

978
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:04,029
they social across colony boundaries?

979
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:06,031
Not where I was in Arizona, but they're

980
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
often friendly across different species

981
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
and they avoided conflict more often than

982
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:10,035
not.

983
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:15,040
And then why does it even matter what's

984
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,040
happening on this plot of lands in this

985
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,044
area?

986
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:22,047
From like a biomimicry perspective, we

987
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:25,050
might learn new algorithms.

988
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,052
It's a sandbox for learning new

989
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:27,052
techniques and observation, all these

990
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:30,055
other richnesses.

991
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:34,059
So it's to say though, what comes away

992
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:34,059
from that science that makes it social

993
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:39,064
science.

994
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:44,069
And I think there's a lot of disciplinary

995
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
ways of understanding that, which I'm

996
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
definitely not expert in in the

997
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
professional fields like counseling, but

998
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
probably in all the different humanities

999
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
and histories and all these other fields,

1000
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
all these different maps, the kind of

1001
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
social the epistemic organizing question

1002
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
and then the social organizing question

1003
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
and the way that technology is also in

1004
00:56:44,069 --> 00:57:19,098
that tangle.

1005
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:22,101
And yeah, someone pointed out like, this

1006
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:22,101
is not a new problem, but then it's like,

1007
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:27,106
well, what parts are new?

1008
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:29,108
And then what's our model by which we're

1009
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:29,108
saying that it's like new or too

1010
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:32,111
individualist or too collective?

1011
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,112
On what scale?

1012
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:36,115
What if they're like, really collectivist

1013
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:36,115
at this scale, but not at this scale or

1014
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:39,118
another?

1015
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:43,121
An example of an ambiguous or at least

1016
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:43,121
like polysimus phenotype of colonies is

1017
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:43,121
in some colonies there's partial

1018
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:43,121
reproductive activation of non

1019
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:56,135
reproductive nest mates.

1020
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:59,138
And that has often been modeled from a

1021
00:57:59,138 --> 00:57:59,138
position of zero is the law and how are

1022
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:04,137
they cheating above this?

1023
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:07,140
But it's also been approached from a

1024
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,143
colony level strategic bet hedging.

1025
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:14,147
So without super deep knowledge of really

1026
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:14,147
some of the specifics of the regularities

1027
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:14,147
that that colony algorithm had to persist

1028
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:14,147
for so long and to have gotten swept off

1029
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:14,147
the table if it was even that's a very

1030
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:28,161
integrated problem.

1031
00:58:29,162 --> 00:58:31,164
So it helps you approach collective

1032
00:58:31,164 --> 00:58:33,166
systems and learn about them.

1033
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:36,169
But it's like there's a lot to say about

1034
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
humidity loss in foraging and humidity

1035
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:42,175
loss isn't even the whole picture.

1036
00:58:43,175 --> 00:58:45,178
And human foraging is a lot more

1037
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:45,178
sophisticated from just like a perception,

1038
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:52,185
, cognition, influence, perspective.

1039
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:56,189
So those are just some ant related

1040
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:56,189
thoughts, but it just centers a lot of

1041
00:58:56,189 --> 00:59:01,188
discussions that really matter.

1042
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:05,192
And I think the really interesting piece

1043
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:05,192
is not always in the way that they're

1044
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:09,196
thought to by some.

1045
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:15,202
Bryn: Yeah, and it's very hard to get any

1046
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
kind of cross pollination or to see cross

1047
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:23,210
pollination studying one agent.

1048
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,212
It's quite, at least to my mind, very

1049
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:25,212
difficult to kind of generalize things

1050
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:28,215
across different agents.

1051
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:34,221
It starts getting a bit tricky to infer

1052
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
one collective's how and why and how they

1053
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:45,232
survive and how another agent does.

1054
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:46,233
It's tricky.

1055
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:50,237
So I'm almost just going to an agent.

1056
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:52,239
Human beings, as hard as they are to

1057
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:52,239
study and just try and run with it as far

1058
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:55,242
as possible.

1059
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:02,698
Otherwise it's just information overload.

1060
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:02,698
.

1061
01:00:12,316 --> 01:00:15,686
Daniel: Body is a complex place too, and

1062
01:00:15,686 --> 01:00:15,686
digital technology, virtuality, these are

1063
01:00:15,686 --> 01:00:15,686
such richly developed topics in the

1064
01:00:15,686 --> 01:00:24,564
social sciences.

1065
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:29,025
I only know the tiniest amount from but I

1066
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:29,025
think that through participation and

1067
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:29,025
inclusion in collaboration and in

1068
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:29,025
conversations and everything, there's

1069
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:29,025
going to be a lot of interesting

1070
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:29,025
connections and paths and it's being

1071
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:53,428
approached seemingly multiple layers.

1072
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,766
The two layers that just we can focus

1073
01:00:56,766 --> 01:00:56,766
most narrowly on is like within the realm

1074
01:00:56,766 --> 01:01:01,633
of science, what is science?

1075
01:01:01,683 --> 01:01:04,944
Which is kind of like playing this other

1076
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:04,944
role with inertia in some people's minds

1077
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:09,426
and in systems, what is science?

1078
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:10,570
Who gets to decide what social science

1079
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:10,585
is?

1080
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:11,642
I don't know.

1081
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:14,907
I'm not in social science but it's system

1082
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:14,907
of interest to society and certainly I'm

1083
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:17,265
a part of that.

1084
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:22,763
So it's like what is good technically,

1085
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:22,763
what is social scientific and then what

1086
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:30,507
is that social scientific?

1087
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:33,866
How is that going to interface into the

1088
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:33,866
metaphysical questions and the normative

1089
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:33,866
ethical and the decision making with

1090
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:33,866
trade offs and the real reflexive complex

1091
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:46,015
decisions that matter?

1092
01:01:47,028 --> 01:01:54,089
Also while recognizing this increasingly

1093
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:54,089
nuanced way of thinking about different

1094
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:54,089
social intelligences, what's any other

1095
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:54,089
random thought or curiosity about

1096
01:01:54,089 --> 01:02:14,233
collective behavior?

1097
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,375
One point that I would have added in to

1098
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:28,375
the lecture was just that in distributed

1099
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:28,375
systems, whether as modeled or as such,

1100
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:28,375
all behavior is arising from interactions

1101
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:40,497
local to individuals.

1102
01:02:40,497 --> 01:02:42,516
Even if it's sent through some wireless

1103
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:42,516
mechanism, it's like all about the local

1104
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:45,543
interactions.

1105
01:02:45,548 --> 01:02:50,591
And so that is an arising type process

1106
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:50,591
that gives the modeler like one hands off

1107
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:58,677
layer at least, if not much more.

1108
01:02:58,677 --> 01:03:02,659
Another nice feature about them, they are

1109
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:02,659
in a way waiting to be composed because

1110
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:02,659
they intrinsically contain at least two

1111
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:13,764
layers of consideration.

1112
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:16,792
Now whether there's kind of like a

1113
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:16,792
forcing function of one layer and just

1114
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:16,792
sort of dangling a bottom layer or

1115
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:16,792
whether there's a lot of what we would

1116
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:16,792
call emergence or discussive in that way

1117
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:16,792
that more arising function can be modeled.

1118
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:28,918
.

1119
01:03:28,919 --> 01:03:31,948
But in either way then you can kind of

1120
01:03:31,948 --> 01:03:31,948
wrap that two layer system and then

1121
01:03:31,948 --> 01:03:35,987
compose them.

1122
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:38,014
So that's like what enables in certain

1123
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:38,014
situations like parallelization or at

1124
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:43,061
least that's obviously a big area.

1125
01:03:43,063 --> 01:03:46,097
But that's what allows multi agent

1126
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
simulation frameworks to do well on

1127
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
certain very challenging sense making and

1128
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
action selection problems, not by

1129
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
guarantee or default because any given

1130
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
slicing and dicing of any given prompting

1131
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
of information may not help you adapt but

1132
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:46,097
there are paths that do and don't help,

1133
01:03:46,097 --> 01:04:16,334
persist or not.

1134
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:19,369
And that's this kind of persistence

1135
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:23,403
starting place that we began with.

1136
01:04:23,403 --> 01:04:24,412
Sasha.

1137
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:31,484
Sasha: Yeah, I really resonate with what

1138
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:31,484
you mentioned about the local

1139
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:31,484
interactions that even if information is

1140
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:31,484
transmitted over long distances then the

1141
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:31,484
agents behave in a way that is locally

1142
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:31,484
relevant and integrates that information.

1143
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:48,654
.

1144
01:04:49,661 --> 01:04:53,700
And it actually makes me think a lot

1145
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
about the psychology therapy angle that

1146
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
while you try to get information about

1147
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
the person's sort of local environment

1148
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
and behavior or perhaps demographics and

1149
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
age, that their informational environment,

1150
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
, like a wealth of what kind of

1151
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
information they consume, might also be

1152
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
really telling about their psychological

1153
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,700
and behavior interactions or pathologies.

1154
01:04:53,700 --> 01:05:31,023
.

1155
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:38,096
And then to bring it kind of full circle

1156
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:38,096
back to that the researcher is part of

1157
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:46,169
the ecosystem that they are studying.

1158
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:52,237
Yeah, I think it's just such a difference

1159
01:05:52,237 --> 01:05:52,237
in perspective to see that as like a

1160
01:05:52,237 --> 01:05:52,237
positive and a gift that the way that you

1161
01:05:52,237 --> 01:05:52,237
would design and run an experiment today

1162
01:05:52,237 --> 01:05:52,237
is not the way that you would do it two

1163
01:05:52,237 --> 01:06:06,317
years from now with more experience.

1164
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:11,367
And so that is a benefit and like a bonus

1165
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:11,367
in the system and not like a negative

1166
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:11,367
perspective of bias that it's detracting

1167
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:25,502
from some underlying truth or reality.

1168
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:28,539
So, just a few thoughts.

1169
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:34,595
Daniel: Very interesting.

1170
01:06:34,596 --> 01:06:38,633
Anyone want to add something?

1171
01:06:44,697 --> 01:06:47,723
I think we didn't fully resolve this

1172
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:47,723
early question about the umvelt term from

1173
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:47,723
ethology behavioral research observation

1174
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:47,723
science using the term to describe the

1175
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:47,723
world as it is experienced by a

1176
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:59,848
particular organism.

1177
01:07:00,796 --> 01:07:02,818
I think a few different pieces and there'

1178
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,837
's a lot of discussion in discourse.

1179
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:07,865
This is just to give it like a super

1180
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:07,865
short overview the world we might connect

1181
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:07,865
to world modeling and there's a lot of

1182
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:07,865
interesting work in all kinds of

1183
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:07,865
different pros focus on qualitative

1184
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:07,865
systems as well as some artificial or

1185
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:23,020
synthetic intelligence.

1186
01:07:23,022 --> 01:07:26,053
World modeling as it is experienced is

1187
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:26,053
one of the sticky and deep ones because

1188
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:32,115
this is the area of phenomenology.

1189
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:35,147
And so this is like a kind of semi

1190
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:38,171
eternal discussion point.

1191
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:41,200
So whether active inference delivers on

1192
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,200
world modeling is kind of empirical and

1193
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,200
just plain whereas as it is experienced

1194
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,200
is going to be a philosophical question

1195
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,200
and then by a particular organism that

1196
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,200
specificity we get by actually making the

1197
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,200
generative model even if we're just

1198
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:59,388
speculating about it.

1199
01:08:00,336 --> 01:08:03,365
It's like talking about experience

1200
01:08:03,365 --> 01:08:03,365
without an experiencer would be like

1201
01:08:03,365 --> 01:08:03,365
talking about some agent's behavior

1202
01:08:03,365 --> 01:08:12,456
without reference to its niche.

1203
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:18,515
And then where there is like that complex

1204
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:18,515
negotiation I think the humanities and a

1205
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:18,515
lot of the social sciences have

1206
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:18,515
identified a lot of the structural top

1207
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:18,515
down and also the personal bottom up

1208
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:18,515
motifs of things being blurred and made

1209
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:39,722
complex.

1210
01:08:40,735 --> 01:08:44,772
And so I think part of the social and the

1211
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
scientific as coming only from the

1212
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
scientific side is like to meet in the

1213
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
third space and or at least make it work

1214
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
to have a mutual compromise where it's

1215
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
like certain social oriented claims based

1216
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:44,772
upon this scientific measure that is

1217
01:08:44,772 --> 01:09:07,945
going to be a judgment call.

1218
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:09,966
But understanding that conversation,

1219
01:09:09,966 --> 01:09:11,984
where is it a mutual compromise?

1220
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:13,001
In what dimensions?

1221
01:09:13,003 --> 01:09:15,027
Not simply along the kind of rigor,

1222
01:09:15,027 --> 01:09:18,052
accessibility or implications axis.

1223
01:09:18,052 --> 01:09:24,119
There's just very many things in play in

1224
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:24,119
these Iterated relationships in

1225
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:24,119
ecosystems, having a researcher as part

1226
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:40,269
of the ecosystem.

1227
01:09:40,274 --> 01:09:43,306
Well, here's the forager question.

1228
01:09:43,307 --> 01:09:45,327
We see the nest mate on the ground, it's

1229
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:46,332
a forager.

1230
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,352
But then we step back, it's like, okay,

1231
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:49,363
well, it's foraging.

1232
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:52,393
And then that's the allocation of the

1233
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:52,398
forager.

1234
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:56,429
Then its foraging is still part of this

1235
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:56,429
sense making, this generative sense

1236
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:56,429
making with process understanding even of

1237
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:56,429
a trace, which is something that Bruno

1238
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:56,429
Latour and others have explored with,

1239
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:56,429
like following a trace in a social

1240
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:56,429
setting and using that to trace networks.

1241
01:09:56,429 --> 01:10:13,547
.

1242
01:10:14,556 --> 01:10:17,587
So in our digital ecosystems, though, our

1243
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:17,587
information ecosystems is not research

1244
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:21,625
happening.

1245
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:25,660
And so what does that really mean?

1246
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:27,683
And then what are those social

1247
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:28,694
normativities?

1248
01:10:28,697 --> 01:10:32,732
There is going to be like a meeting or a

1249
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:32,732
handoff with where that really is

1250
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:32,732
happening, or maybe it's a knocking on

1251
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:40,816
the door that's ignored.

1252
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:46,879
Or it could be whatever metaphor in that

1253
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:49,904
setting it actually is.

1254
01:10:49,906 --> 01:10:51,926
There's no general metaphor because that'

1255
01:10:51,926 --> 01:10:51,926
'd be like, oh, what's the general

1256
01:10:51,926 --> 01:10:54,956
metaphor on this experiment?

1257
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:55,967
Which experiment?

1258
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:59,001
Just the general action that we plan to

1259
01:10:59,001 --> 01:10:59,005
take.

1260
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:03,982
Oh, hard to say.

1261
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,249
Bryn: It okay.

1262
01:11:29,249 --> 01:11:32,272
Daniel: Well, in our last sections, I

1263
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:32,272
guess if anybody types a question live

1264
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:32,272
chat we'll look at, otherwise, what are

1265
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:38,335
any other thoughts?

1266
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:44,399
Or like, what what can we learn more

1267
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:50,457
about about collective behavior?

1268
01:11:51,462 --> 01:11:53,485
Or what will it mean for our sense making,

1269
01:11:53,485 --> 01:11:53,485
, decision making, if we understand

1270
01:11:53,485 --> 01:11:56,519
collective behavior better?

1271
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:01,049
What else are people excited about for

1272
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:03,063
the rest of the course?

1273
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:15,182
Like, based upon the sections that we've

1274
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:15,182
done so far and how we can even start to

1275
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:15,182
approach this in an acknowledged, limited,

1276
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:26,295
, finite way?

1277
01:13:28,312 --> 01:13:28,316
Yeah.

1278
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:30,335
Sasha than anyone else.

1279
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:36,395
Sasha: I just added a question to the

1280
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:36,395
very bottom of the notes, and it makes me

1281
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:36,395
think about how, working on this document

1282
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:36,395
collaboratively throughout the last hour,

1283
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:36,395
we're able to kind of leave a stigmagic

1284
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:51,547
trace of things we've discussed.

1285
01:13:51,548 --> 01:13:55,582
And what sort of traits or practices

1286
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:55,582
should individual humans I guess I should

1287
01:13:55,582 --> 01:14:00,578
specify humans.

1288
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:03,609
Should we embody in order to improve

1289
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:06,637
cohesion in collective behavior?

1290
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,686
It makes me think of certain psychology

1291
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:11,686
traits or descriptions of, like, openness

1292
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:19,761
or conscientiousness.

1293
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:25,825
What will make individual humans better

1294
01:14:25,825 --> 01:14:30,872
participants in collective behavior?

1295
01:14:36,934 --> 01:14:40,973
Bryn: Yeah, I think to add to that, to

1296
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:40,973
just emphasize the importance, again,

1297
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:40,973
only with human agents, specifically, who

1298
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:40,973
have the capacity to think and reflect,

1299
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:40,973
and the only ones that have those really

1300
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:40,973
advanced capabilities that we know of as

1301
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:40,973
yet, but to really kind of leverage in

1302
01:14:40,973 --> 01:15:09,200
order to make the collective better.

1303
01:15:09,201 --> 01:15:12,232
There's a responsibility of the

1304
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
individual, despite being part of a

1305
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
collective on many different fronts, to

1306
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
be able to leverage and utilize their own

1307
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
internal states and what they have

1308
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
learned, and to be able to think, to

1309
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
retain the individual's mind and think

1310
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
about the collective, I think is so

1311
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:12,232
important if the collective is to become

1312
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:44,551
healthier.

1313
01:15:44,552 --> 01:15:46,573
Sasha, to your point, and to improve.

1314
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:47,579
Andrew: Its.

1315
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:54,650
Bryn: To become more conscientious and

1316
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:54,650
become more responsible or whatever that

1317
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,690
might be.

1318
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:09,749
So to always try and maintain a thinking

1319
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:12,776
self is crucial.

1320
01:16:14,795 --> 01:16:17,823
You can very easily be usurped into the

1321
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,836
collective as is.

1322
01:16:20,851 --> 01:16:23,885
If you just go on any social media

1323
01:16:23,885 --> 01:16:23,885
platform, you will see individuals rarely

1324
01:16:23,885 --> 01:16:23,885
thinking for themselves and seemingly

1325
01:16:23,885 --> 01:16:34,999
kind of just fueling each other.

1326
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:36,018
And that causes massive problems.

1327
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:40,054
So an individual mind strikes me as being

1328
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:40,054
just the most important thing in the

1329
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:44,095
future going forward.

1330
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,170
Daniel: It yeah.

1331
01:16:52,171 --> 01:16:55,203
This dialectic with individuation and

1332
01:16:55,203 --> 01:16:55,203
collectivization as these ongoing

1333
01:16:55,203 --> 01:16:55,203
negotiated compromise that can be also

1334
01:16:55,203 --> 01:17:03,222
viewed many ways.

1335
01:17:03,223 --> 01:17:10,297
However, they are cognitive science

1336
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:14,335
coming into play.

1337
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:20,399
Maybe historical processes or

1338
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:20,399
philosophies were used in many settings

1339
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:20,399
for even approaching these kinds of

1340
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:34,535
social questions.

1341
01:17:35,546 --> 01:17:38,578
And now with computer science and

1342
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:38,578
technology, it even is a discussion more

1343
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:38,578
about the capacities of measurement and

1344
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:47,663
action.

1345
01:17:48,674 --> 01:17:50,695
Not that those are new in and of

1346
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:50,695
themselves, but thinking like a state,

1347
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:50,695
like the development of the apparatus,

1348
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:50,695
the development of the social systems

1349
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:50,695
that can be run on open source hardware,

1350
01:17:50,695 --> 01:18:03,765
open source software, things like that.

1351
01:18:08,813 --> 01:18:12,855
I don't know if something's generalized

1352
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:12,855
across all such groups, but understanding

1353
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:12,855
what environments, at least initially

1354
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:12,855
things are beginning at is just a realist

1355
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:27,000
starting point.

1356
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:32,005
Probably no guarantee since most things,

1357
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:32,005
all things are swept off the table in

1358
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:36,009
their specifics anyway.

1359
01:18:41,014 --> 01:18:44,017
And how to deal with that kind of like

1360
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
skin on the line type of decision making

1361
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
is very interesting how it's pursued in

1362
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
the sciences because often many runs are

1363
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
presented or that kind of catastrophic

1364
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
failure mode of models is not considered.

1365
01:18:44,017 --> 01:19:01,028
.

1366
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:05,032
It's just like part of the training,

1367
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:05,032
starting naive so just the way that

1368
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:05,032
different social considerations are

1369
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:13,040
converged upon.

1370
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:17,044
It's not like reduced to one feature of

1371
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,044
the social because the social is such an

1372
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:21,048
open space.

1373
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:27,054
As a scientist, always impressed by how

1374
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:27,054
that writing could kind of open up the

1375
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:27,054
situations which are, like, mundane, but

1376
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:27,054
also, of course, very deep and meaningful.

1377
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:38,065
.

1378
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,068
Also, though, mundane.

1379
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,103
Any other thoughts or otherwise on

1380
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:22,103
collective behavior or on the social

1381
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:29,110
sciences course or anything?

1382
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:33,114
Otherwise people can have any last words

1383
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:34,115
if they want.

1384
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:41,122
Yeah.

1385
01:20:41,122 --> 01:20:41,122
Awesome.

1386
01:20:41,122 --> 01:20:43,124
Thank you all for participating.

1387
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:45,126
David, want to add anything?

1388
01:20:45,126 --> 01:20:46,127
Bryn: Excellent.

1389
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:56,137
Daniel: Yeah.

1390
01:20:56,137 --> 01:20:58,139
Well, I look forward to more questions

1391
01:20:58,139 --> 01:21:01,136
being asked on the course website.

1392
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:03,138
And everybody's engagement with the

1393
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:06,141
course is very much appreciated.

1394
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:08,143
So keep up the collective.

1395
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:11,146
Thanks for multiscale learning, and it's

1396
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:12,147
a fun course.

1397
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:14,149
Really happy that we could have done the

1398
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,149
session and very happy to have concluded

1399
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:17,152
the session.

1400
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:21,156
All right, thank you.

1401
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:22,157
Bryn: Bye bye.

1402
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:23,158
Bern ciao.
