Let us all go around and give an opening in introduction and or reflection and see who joins.	We're in collective behavior discussion section for Social sciences course in 2023	Introduction to Collective Behavior
136310	505210	02:16	Sasha: What is an agent in active inference? Regina: You can have that agent not be just an individual, but also your definition of an individual changes depending on what you want to study in the behavior. Sasha: Can never have an objective way of studying something if you're part of the environment of the agent.	Sasha: Regina, what is an agent in active inference	Active Inference 6, An Agent in Collective Behavior
507870	813290	08:27	And then another thing that you mentioned was about the individual being part of the ecosystem. That makes me think a lot about complexity science. This is really the question of what makes something first principles or what are the first principles? Who wants to bring in some new angle or how do they see collective behavior?	Daniel: Complexity science has looked at agent based modeling as a fundamental tool	Exploring the Complexity of Science
825820	1026616	13:45	I think of collective behavior in kind of like, I don't know, a football team or a soccer team. Without that collective behavior, it might be far harder to achieve a group's goals. Maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively, just the thoughts.	Andrew: I think of collective behavior in kind of like football teams	Does Collective Behavior Have a Goal?
1026648	1984410	17:06	What's the role of formal methods in different kinds of academic or practical expressions about social systems? For formalizing aspects of a social system, the purpose is for communication between individuals. There is no explicit guarantee what you're saying encompasses everything you're observing.	Andrew: What is the role of formal methods in the social sciences	What's Normative About Active Inference?
1999170	2621748	33:19	I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the autopoietic nature of information systems. How do we take this active inference, collective behavior crossover and think about what it really means in how we're going to be thinking differently?	Andrew: I think there is a problem with the amount of information sharing	Andrew on the autopoietic nature of information systems
2621844	2861370	43:41	There's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference. The field is so multi nodal. It has so much the free energy principle, the Bayesian brain, even just to psychology. What do these different kinds of scientific artifacts do for who?	Daniel: I'm still learning how to apply Bayesian brain to psychology	Inactive Inference in the Social Sciences
2875520	3272340	47:55	For me, it's about safety and need to belong. There are places that are more collective, and there are places which are more individualistic. There's so much loaded on different understandings among people. Science is not simply the social.	What are people wondering about collective behavior, even if we're totally not addressing it	What are people wondering about collective behavior
3275960	3994544	54:35	Daniel: Could first principles explain why an ant colony exists? He asks: Is the nest mate the individual and then the colony? Is the social? What comes away from that science that makes it social science?	Daniel: First principles could explain why an ant colony exists	Why Does an Ant Colony Exist?
3994662	4289944	1:06:34	World modeling as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones. Whether active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain. There's just very many things in play in these Iterated relationships in ecosystems. Where is it a mutual compromise? In what dimensions?	World modeling as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones	World-Modeling as It Is Experienced
4289982	4781580	1:11:29	What traits or practices should individual humans embody in order to improve cohesion in collective behavior? An individual mind strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward. To always try and maintain a thinking self is crucial.	What should individual humans embody to improve cohesion in collective behavior	What will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior?
4819360	4883290	1:20:19	Any other thoughts or otherwise on collective behavior or on the social sciences course or anything? Otherwise people can have any last words if they want. Thank you all for participating. Well, I look forward to more questions being asked on the course website.
