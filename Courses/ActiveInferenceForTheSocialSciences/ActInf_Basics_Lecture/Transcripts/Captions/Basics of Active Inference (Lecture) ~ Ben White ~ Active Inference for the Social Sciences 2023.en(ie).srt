1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:01,979
all right

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,319
hello and welcome everyone it is July 11

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,019
2023 we are in active inference for the

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,599
social sciences and today is going to be

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,660
a lecture by Ben White on basics of

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,340
active inference the active inference

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,800
agent Subban thank you for the lecture

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
off to you and we're looking forward to

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,760
it

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,340
thank you very much yeah me too

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,279
um very happy to be a part of this

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
um to be kicking things off with the the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
first module on this course

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,880
um I'm going to be talking about

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,980
um the active inference agent and trying

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,780
to cover some of the basics

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,579
um I won't take too long introducing

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,320
myself Ava or gave a very thorough

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,399
introduction

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,640
um in in his talk recently but I'm a

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
second year PhD student in philosophy at

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,719
the University of Sussex and I work with

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,000
Andy Clark and with aval and some other

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
people

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,000
um using active inference

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,340
to try and find things out about our

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,920
relationship with technology and within

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,539
the context of well-being and mental

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,640
health

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,460
the aims for today I'm going to try and

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,780
provide quite a wide-ranging overview of

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,299
how active inference has connected with

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,299
areas of philosophical interest and

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,340
particularly how they relate to the

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,560
individual agent and the experience of

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
the agent and how the agent finds

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,220
themselves in the world so I've split

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,299
this up

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,640
um to look at several different defined

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,040
topics so I'm going to move quite

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,700
quickly through mind agency emotion and

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,860
phenomenology and I'm going to say a

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,960
little bit about the self as well and

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,820
then there's going to be a case study at

45
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,900
the end that I'm going to move through

46
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,640
if we have time

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,979
so one of the other aims that I have is

48
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,500
to lay out very clearly some of the Core

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,479
Concepts and core mechanisms like

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,460
Precision weighting and prediction error

51
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,700
generative models I'm not going to go

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,920
into any technical details whatsoever

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,899
this is all going to be fairly abstract

54
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,299
my background and my interest in these

55
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,159
Frameworks is philosophical so it's

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,740
quite quite abstract in terms of how

57
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,479
everything fits together

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,400
and I'm going to try and bring some of

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,340
these threads together to to build up a

60
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,160
layered picture of what the active

61
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,500
inference agent is like because this

62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,379
course is kind of aimed towards seeing

63
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,440
how active influence supplies to larger

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,680
scales Collective Behavior social norms

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,379
socio-cultural Landscapes and I think in

66
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,840
order to do justice to those things we

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,120
need to First have a good idea of the

68
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,420
individual in active influence so we've

69
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,120
got our work cut out for us um so I'll

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,560
get started

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,560
so before I dive in I wanted to just say

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,180
a little bit about how these Frameworks

73
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,800
hang together so

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,700
um

75
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,800
active inferences based on call for

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,300
instance free energy principle I think

77
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,040
most of us are familiar with that but

78
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,819
it's

79
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,500
the free energy principle just states

80
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,140
that in order to persist Through Time

81
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,940
biological organisms must occupy only

82
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,500
those states that it would expect to

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,360
occupy given the type of thing that it

84
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,819
is so free energy is essentially a

85
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,040
measure of the disattunement between a

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,780
system and its environment and I'm going

87
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,700
to say say a little bit more about a

88
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,340
tune and how that gets cashed out in

89
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,200
various ways as we go on

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,239
active inference is a process theory

91
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,459
that essentially explains how embodied

92
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,680
organisms actually go about remaining in

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
those expected States so how we actually

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,159
go about minimizing free energy and the

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,580
idea is that all adaptive behavior is

96
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,019
explained by agents garnering evidence

97
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,640
to confirm

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,340
um their own expectations

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,140
the predictive processing for the

100
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,000
purposes of the lecture today I'm going

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,879
to treat these as synonymous because

102
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,799
most of the work that I kind of came up

103
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,140
through as I was learning about this was

104
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,780
predictive processing and all of the

105
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,739
papers

106
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,080
um that we're using today that refer to

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,720
predictive processing refer to a

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,760
predictive processing that I take to be

109
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
more or less synonymous with active

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,319
inference so that's a a very embodied

111
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,439
inactive flavor of predictive processing

112
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,360
I think generally the difference is that

113
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,860
predictive processing can be a much

114
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,599
broader term and predictive processing

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,000
can also apply to passive models of

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,500
perception but we're not going to

117
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,199
concern ourselves with that

118
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,940
okay

119
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,280
so some key concepts of active inference

120
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,620
slash predictive processing then

121
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,100
so the framework says that agents embody

122
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,320
or agents have

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,180
um we won't concern ourselves with the

124
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,400
with the Nuance there but they have a

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,160
generative model which is essentially

126
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,400
um a kind of understanding or a model of

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,199
the regularities that underpin the

128
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,000
Dynamics between the agent and the

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
environment so another way to think

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,780
about this in very rough terms is a kind

131
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,720
of mental model of the regularities in

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,940
the world and how the agent exists in

133
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,020
the world

134
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,419
and using that model the agent can

135
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,340
generate predictions about its own

136
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,280
sensory States so given the model what

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,080
kinds of sensory States would it expect

138
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,540
to find itself in in a particular set of

139
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,160
circumstances

140
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,160
and so where those predictions don't

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
actually match the sensory inputs so

142
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,240
where there's a discrepancy between the

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,639
actual income incense data and the

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,600
prediction

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,699
prediction errors are generated and

146
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,020
prediction errors are going to flow

147
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,120
upwards through the hierarchy so the um

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,100
the generative model is said to be a

149
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,960
hierarchical model and predictions flow

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
downwards some prediction errors flow

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,300
upwards and the sole imperative of the

152
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,100
brain body system according to this

153
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,780
framework is to minimize those

154
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,679
prediction errors

155
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,639
so

156
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,860
a good way to kind of get a little

157
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,660
handle on this is to think about just

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,180
the example of perception so perception

159
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,560
traditionally so I'm talking about

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,759
visual perception here it's

161
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,139
traditionally been understood as a

162
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,780
bottom-up process and what that means is

163
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,880
that the brain waits for incoming

164
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,919
sensory signals and then it processes

165
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,139
them as they come in and it combines

166
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,759
them in kind of increasingly abstract

167
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
ways and what we see is some combination

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,860
of those sensory signals that have come

169
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,100
in and been processed and combined so if

170
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,620
if you think about me leaving my uh

171
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,120
apartment in the morning and stepping

172
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,100
out onto the street and seeing some cars

173
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,319
what's happening there is some sensory

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,539
information is hitting my retina and

175
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,940
it's being processed at first with for

176
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,160
very basic features like light shade

177
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,620
edges and so on and so forth and then

178
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,360
it's being combined with my

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,580
understanding of what car is or what a

180
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,160
bus stop is and that gives me my kind of

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,699
visual field

182
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,919
predictive processing aimlessly at this

183
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,020
point flips this picture upside down on

184
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,060
its head so visual perception on the

185
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,919
predictive process and is a top-down

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,800
Affair so the generative model is going

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,620
to encode multi-level expectations about

188
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,360
the likely scene so just to be very

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,759
clear when we talk about multi-level and

190
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,819
hierarchical the higher up is the higher

191
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:03,960
up levels are going to be tracking

192
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
longer time scales and higher levels of

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,979
abstraction and the lower levels are

194
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,539
going to be much faster and much more

195
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,740
concrete

196
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,520
so a changeable scene so there's going

197
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,440
to be some variation in what I see when

198
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,479
I leave my apartment every day is going

199
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,500
to mean that there's always going to be

200
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,180
some error in that picture so it's never

201
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,099
going to be the same two days in a row

202
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,400
or it's extremely unlikely to be so no

203
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
matter how well I can predict what I'm

204
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
going to see when I leave my house it's

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,680
always going to be cleaned up by some

206
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,960
prediction errors okay so essentially

207
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,120
when I step outside and I step into the

208
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,819
street my brain is already anticipating

209
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,160
what it's going to see out there

210
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,500
okay so I know where particular cars are

211
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,240
going to be parked I know where the bus

212
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,060
stop is so on and so forth and the

213
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,639
perceptual experience that we have is a

214
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
construction it's uh we actually

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,199
experience the expectation that has been

216
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,720
kind of cleaned up post-prediction error

217
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,580
and there's a little bit of debate there

218
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,620
about exactly what it is that we

219
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,919
experience but um for our purposes today

220
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,539
um we can say that visual perception is

221
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,919
essentially a construction

222
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,259
so on the face of it prediction errors

223
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,880
can be minimized using one of two

224
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,259
strategies and this is going to be

225
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,340
really really important

226
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,900
so we have what I just described there

227
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,819
which is perceptual inference that's

228
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,099
where we revise our predictions to

229
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,720
better fit the evidence so essentially

230
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,819
we update our model to better reflect

231
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,099
the regularities in the environment

232
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,679
or we can engage in active inference

233
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,659
which is where the framework gets its

234
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,279
name from which is where we essentially

235
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,760
make the evidence fit the model okay so

236
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,039
that's where we in some sense update the

237
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,080
world so it conforms to the original

238
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,260
prediction and active inference agents

239
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,540
bring about those expected states by

240
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,060
sampling the world in a biased way so

241
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,339
they have certain expectations and then

242
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,140
we sample the world to confirm the

243
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,279
predictions

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,560
and I put perceptual inference there in

245
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,300
scare quotes because

246
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,519
perceptual inference on

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,040
um kind of readings of most readings of

248
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,839
active inference just becomes a kind of

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,360
action Readiness or as ramstead and

250
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,700
colleagues but a state estimation so

251
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,980
it's just perception and action are just

252
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,320
wrapped up in this continuous loop but

253
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,940
it's really all about the action it's

254
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,260
all really all about bringing about

255
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,420
those expected States and perception is

256
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,940
just kind of in service of that process

257
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,000
and so bruenberg and colleagues refer to

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the active inference agent as a crooked

259
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,120
scientist which is uh something I really

260
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,380
like I think that's a very Charming

261
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,600
image so we are scientists that are

262
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,880
engaging in some very dodgy Behavior

263
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,040
because we're not really interested in

264
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,660
uh we're not really interested in having

265
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,399
an accurate model we're more interested

266
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,540
in

267
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,260
um confirming our original predictions

268
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,120
Okay so

269
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,399
that was a very very rapid overview of

270
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,519
some of the Core Concepts and mechanisms

271
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,600
but they're going to crop up

272
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,399
continuously so I think we're going to

273
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
get um a much better grasp on them as we

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
go on in this section I'm going to start

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,060
to expand on some of those things that

276
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,380
we've just put on the table and I'm

277
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,060
going to begin to flesh them out in

278
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,459
terms of thinking about how active

279
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,980
inference agents actually exist in the

280
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,620
world

281
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,940
so I should say I put this here to

282
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,160
remind me so those of you who are taking

283
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,899
part in the course

284
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,640
um I'm going to make available a

285
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,100
document with all of the readings that I

286
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,360
firstly all of the readings that I've

287
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,459
used to make these slides and then a

288
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,959
bunch of other readings as well that I

289
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,240
think can be very relevant and um

290
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,860
obviously they're going to be organized

291
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,360
in terms of the structure of this

292
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,580
presentation as well so this is just I

293
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,260
put a little sample up on these slides

294
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,760
but there's going to be much more in the

295
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,040
document

296
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,480
so I think it's always good to start

297
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,519
with some guiding questions

298
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,839
so I've thrown up three here

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,579
the first is how does active inference

300
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,320
characterize cognition so we've just

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,279
looked at

302
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,440
um predictions and prediction errors but

303
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,579
we're going to expand on that a little

304
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,500
bit and we're going to ask what kinds of

305
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,440
processes does cognition involve how is

306
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
cognition related to the material

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,320
environment this is going to be

308
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,399
something

309
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,839
um how cognition relates to the

310
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,800
environment that's going to be very

311
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
important in subsequent weeks and we're

312
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,120
going to ask quite briefly what kinds of

313
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,040
vehicles might realize cognitive

314
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,300
processing

315
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,480
okay so it is here's a couple of whales

316
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,519
whales are going to be a recurring theme

317
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,320
in this lecture

318
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
um but I wanted to take a step back and

319
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,700
ask about Attunement because this is one

320
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
of those Concepts that gets thrown

321
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
around a lot and I think once it's

322
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,480
grasped it becomes very very clear and

323
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,459
very easy to use but I think prior to it

324
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,839
being grasped it can be a little bit

325
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,779
opaque and a bit slippery so on the left

326
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,480
we have a humpback whale that was found

327
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,000
dead in the Amazon rainforest allegedly

328
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,339
I don't know if this was true and on the

329
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,839
right we have a whale in its natural

330
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,600
environment and I think clearly the

331
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,160
intuition here is that in one case the

332
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,720
whale is very well attuned to its

333
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,279
environment and in the other case it's

334
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,180
not

335
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,339
and I think that we can start by asking

336
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,220
what is it about the ocean that allows

337
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,980
the whale to be well attuned and what I

338
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,620
want to say here is that the particular

339
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,660
Dynamics Between the Ocean and the whale

340
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,360
allow the whale to do certain things

341
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,720
that it can't do when it's in the Amazon

342
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,820
so in other words we might say that the

343
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,100
ocean affords certain things to the

344
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,220
whale specifically filter feeding

345
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,560
um being able to move its vast weight

346
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,600
around with ease

347
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,459
um things that unfortunately are wailing

348
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,899
that Amazon can't do

349
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,300
so affordances are opportunities for

350
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
Action

351
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,260
um they they are things roughly speaking

352
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,120
in the environment that the agent can

353
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,519
act upon and there's some debate about

354
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,620
the proper way to really characterize

355
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,660
affordances but I like to think of them

356
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,600
as relational properties emerging from

357
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,180
an environmental feature and some

358
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,959
skilled embodied ability of the agent so

359
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,940
the same thing in the environment will

360
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,160
not afford the same thing to different

361
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,480
organisms so for example uh soil to a

362
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,820
human agent might afford walking on or

363
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,220
laying down on but to an earthworm it

364
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,160
affords very different things and also

365
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,200
even amongst the same organisms with

366
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,320
humans especially different surfaces and

367
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,060
features of the environment will afford

368
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,320
different things depending on your

369
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,660
particular skill set

370
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,639
um and agents are going to go about

371
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,800
minimizing their uncertainty so

372
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,380
minimizing prediction errors staying

373
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,180
attuned to their environment through an

374
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,639
engagement with affordances and this is

375
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,200
going to be something that is going to

376
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,000
drift away slightly as we move through

377
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
some sections and then it's going to

378
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
come back very heavily at the end

379
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,700
and I should say that the idea of

380
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,040
affordances to my knowledge it first

381
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,160
emerges in the work of James Gibson the

382
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,019
ecological approach to visual perception

383
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,880
I think is chapter eight in that book

384
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,500
that really lays out a theory of

385
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,100
performances

386
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,519
so this idea that systems or organisms

387
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,680
maintain their organization through

388
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,959
ongoing action

389
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,579
um means that active inference has been

390
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,040
labeled as quintessentially inactive by

391
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,940
Corporation and I think that this is a

392
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,700
nice in inactivism is an older framework

393
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,579
from theoretical cognitive science and I

394
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,399
think it's a nice way to understand some

395
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,079
of the key features of active inference

396
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,060
but it does come with a little bit of

397
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,519
historical philosophical baggage and I'm

398
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,899
going to try and unpack that really

399
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,760
quickly

400
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,860
um because I want to unpack exactly what

401
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,959
it is that we're committing ourselves to

402
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,060
when we think about cognition in in

403
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,740
activist terms

404
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,040
so inactivism comes in various strands

405
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
very very quickly and roughly you have

406
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,220
Auto poetic inactivism which commits

407
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,779
itself to what's known as the Mind life

408
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,300
continuity thesis this is essentially

409
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,660
that the structures that um give a

410
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,420
ground to life itself are the same

411
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,000
structures that instantiate cognitive

412
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,160
processes

413
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,380
um sensing on this view is teleological

414
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,260
because it's Oriental oriented around

415
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,540
supporting vital systems so things in

416
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,519
the environment have intrinsic meaning

417
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,160
to the organism because they support the

418
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,600
vital

419
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,220
um functioning of the organism in some

420
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,720
way

421
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,380
sensory motor in activism emphasizes how

422
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,519
mobile and embodied agents essentially

423
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,380
enact the grounds and conditions for

424
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
their own sensory engagements with the

425
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,339
world so the world is not a kind of

426
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,440
neutral static given that we're

427
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,199
parachuted into actually the conditions

428
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,480
through which we sense the world

429
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,760
are the conditions that we

430
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,459
um we can move and kind of interact with

431
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,980
the world in various ways

432
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,959
um and then there's radical inactivism

433
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,120
and this is

434
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,459
um The View that cognition is purely

435
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,320
grounded in these agent environment

436
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,600
Dynamics it's a purely dynamicist

437
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,240
account of cognition and there's no role

438
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,880
whatsoever for internal representations

439
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,880
so certainly in certain brands of

440
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,100
sensory motor in activism there remains

441
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,399
a role for internal manipulation of

442
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,620
representations and mental

443
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,019
representations are just mental states

444
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,959
that are about something in the world so

445
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,139
some mental state is reconstructing some

446
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,839
feature of the world and this all harks

447
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,920
back to

448
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,839
um kind of old debates in philosophy of

449
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,300
cognitive science between internalist

450
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,540
Notions of cognition and more embodied

451
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,860
embedded extended and will take a more

452
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,779
of a look at that in a second but the

453
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,699
question here is what are we committing

454
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,500
ourselves to with active inference

455
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,019
active inference and I need to be a

456
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,699
little bit careful because I think that

457
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,139
people are going to disagree with this

458
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,139
to a certain extents

459
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,880
but I think we're certainly committing

460
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
ourselves to sensory motor in activism I

461
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,839
think that's fairly uncontroversial and

462
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,059
I would say as well that the the

463
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,799
underpinning of active inference by the

464
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,679
free energy principle by my lights also

465
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,439
commits us or it certainly Chimes very

466
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,260
deeply with the core tenets of Auto

467
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,720
poetic inactivism

468
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,699
but I think what's really interesting in

469
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,380
trying to understand cognition in the

470
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,119
active inference agent is to understand

471
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,919
what role if any there are for

472
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,299
representations

473
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,160
so

474
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,500
if you have any familiarity with the

475
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,940
literature on active inference you'll

476
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,280
know that active inference people are

477
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
always banging on about models

478
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
prediction errors

479
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,440
um various other computationally

480
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,160
sounding things and so the worry here is

481
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,780
at least for

482
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,820
um well it's not necessarily A worry but

483
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,220
the thought the thought would be are we

484
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,960
committing ourselves to a form of

485
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,559
cognitivism and again cognitivism is

486
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,460
this is generally considered to be a

487
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,320
old-fashioned notion of cognition as

488
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,799
like computation over symbolic

489
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,780
representations in the brain According

490
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,880
to some syntactic set of rules or

491
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,039
something

492
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,140
and typically over the last couple of

493
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,820
decades in cognitive science people have

494
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,220
been moving away from that view so it

495
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,360
would be interesting if we were

496
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,860
committing ourselves to something that

497
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,740
we'd already moved away from and some

498
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,780
people think that we we are making that

499
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,000
commitment so Jakob Howie for example

500
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
has argued in various places

501
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,340
um that essentially predictive

502
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,500
processing or active inference commits

503
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,480
us to these very rich reconstructive

504
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,539
Notions of representation and even Andy

505
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,440
Clark

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,380
um Jacob Howie's Boyle in many many

507
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,200
places has said himself that he thinks

508
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,940
that representations play a role here as

509
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,720
well so in a talk in 2016 Clark said

510
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,419
it's internal representation I think it

511
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,460
is these are representation using

512
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,100
stories but it's not internal

513
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,380
representation in quite the way that we

514
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,120
originally thought about it

515
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,520
so there's some differences perhaps

516
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
major differences between Howie and

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,360
Clark there but others have pushed back

518
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,580
so there's a paper by Maxwell ramstead

519
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,679
and colleagues from 2020 I think it's a

520
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,500
tale of two densities paper

521
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,700
where they say

522
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,100
um

523
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,840
that a proper understanding of the

524
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,460
generative models in active inference

525
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,320
suggests that there's no role for

526
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,940
representations

527
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,980
um so this is the kind of anti-howie

528
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,160
view

529
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,620
so

530
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,020
I really like this paper from Axel

531
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,299
constant and Andy Clark and Carl friston

532
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,120
which essentially tries to broker some

533
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,460
kind of piece in a debate that in some

534
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,640
form or another has been raging for

535
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,980
decades so it'd be quite nice to finally

536
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,419
put this to bed

537
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,940
um so they argue that we can find in the

538
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,860
formalisms of active inference we can

539
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,919
find grounds for an Armistice here

540
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,679
um so they argue that the formalisms of

541
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,720
active inference show that quote

542
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,100
representational and

543
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,260
non-representational cognitive processes

544
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,539
can be implemented by the brain under

545
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,179
active inference and they do this by

546
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,500
showing that active inference

547
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,140
accommodates a dual architecture

548
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,140
so they show that on the one hand

549
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,740
um in some sense the brain has to

550
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,559
represent because under active inference

551
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,320
uh action selection policies are

552
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,660
happening over extended time scales and

553
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,700
so the agent has to engage in some kind

554
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
of counter factual thinking so if I do x

555
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,160
what happens if I do y what happens and

556
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,380
so on and the argument very roughly

557
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,940
speaking is that that is going to entail

558
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,400
some kind of representational some use

559
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,440
of representations

560
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,960
but on the other hand they argue that

561
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,419
what they call diontic actions are

562
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,160
processed through different mappings in

563
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,600
the generative model and they're

564
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,179
directly triggered by sensory input so a

565
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,140
deontic action is an action that is

566
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,460
ingrained by our sense of the

567
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,220
expectations of others so the example

568
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,140
that the authors use is stopping at some

569
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,059
red traffic lights in the middle of the

570
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,100
night when there's nobody else around

571
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,700
so in a sense the the claim is that we

572
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,059
through a kind of social conditioning we

573
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,000
know what the what other people would

574
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,799
expect us to do in those circumstances

575
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,620
and that allows for this kind of dynamic

576
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,200
reflective reflexive

577
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,520
um action policies I think

578
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,960
and in those cases

579
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,520
um there's no room for representer or

580
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,900
there's no need for representations

581
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,280
there

582
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,159
um I would uh definitely suggest people

583
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,600
interested in this go and read this

584
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,880
paper because you might already have

585
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,080
thought you might already have thought

586
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,780
of some potential objections here uh to

587
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,820
the um the claim that representations

588
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,919
aren't needed for the Arctic action and

589
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,600
they do go into some detail in talking

590
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,780
about uh potential objections there

591
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,940
so

592
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,580
that's the kind of status of the role of

593
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,500
representations

594
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,840
um it's a live debate not everybody

595
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,020
agrees but it certainly looks as though

596
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,380
active inference has the formal tools to

597
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,320
accommodate both sides of the debate and

598
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,760
it might turn out that that's a good

599
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,679
thing because we can make everybody

600
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,380
happy or it might turn out to be a bad

601
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,940
thing because you might think well we've

602
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,500
not really settled anything one way or

603
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,659
another

604
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,179
I wanted to take some time though

605
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,799
um to mention

606
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,919
um Extended active inference so I've

607
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,140
been talking about inactivism and I've

608
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,299
mentioned that uh I've mentioned this

609
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,460
debate between cognitivism and older

610
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,320
older ways of thinking about sorry

611
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,659
cognitivism and newer ways of thinking

612
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,299
about cognition as embodied or embedded

613
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,340
and these are part of what's known as

614
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,480
the 4E Paradigm and clearly I think we

615
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,419
are talking about inactive cognition and

616
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,059
you get embodied and embedded kind of

617
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,159
for free with this so the only one left

618
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,100
on the table is the extended mind and

619
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,780
this was just the claim that under some

620
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,820
conditions

621
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,179
um the system that's

622
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,360
um realizing cognitive processing can

623
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,780
literally extend outwards from the mind

624
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,460
so I'll put some nice readings for this

625
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,500
up if anybody's unfamiliar and

626
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,539
interested but it's usually the most

627
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,120
controversial of the four is

628
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,960
um

629
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,000
and Andy Clark who is one of the

630
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
original authors of the extended mind

631
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,740
paper really thinks that uh active

632
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,440
influence accommodates uh the extended

633
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,539
mind Theory and it's not just that it

634
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,120
accommodates it but it actually solves

635
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,919
some old problems in the extended mind

636
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,340
about knowing how and why the brain uh

637
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,240
knows when and where to recruit certain

638
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,580
extraneural resources and part of the

639
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,260
argument for this what really sits at

640
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,820
the core is

641
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,679
um Club develops this argument based on

642
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,299
the fact that the generative models in

643
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,039
active inference are always in this

644
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,840
always making a trade-off between

645
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,440
accuracy and complexity so you want your

646
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,320
model of the world to be accurate enough

647
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,659
that you can act effectively on the

648
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,780
world but you also want to minimize the

649
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,059
metabolic costs of having models that

650
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,480
are overly complex and so Clark utilizes

651
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,659
this insight to to make the case that

652
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,799
this explains that in some cases we as

653
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,559
agents we make use of these um extra

654
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,200
neural kind of props and tools and

655
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,400
things

656
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,559
um and he says that the the imperative

657
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,780
to reduce uncertainty provides a

658
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,299
location neutral cost function that's

659
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,220
always been missing from the older

660
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,039
arguments around extended mind

661
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,280
so the upshot to this I think is that

662
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
you end up with a view of Agents as

663
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,260
deeply coupled with their environments

664
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,860
so under active inference it's just

665
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,880
nonsensical to try and think about

666
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,559
agents as decoupled from their

667
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,600
environment the generative models

668
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,059
themselves are of the Dynamics between

669
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,340
the agent and the environment so these

670
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,100
two things can't be decoupled

671
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,400
um perception action Loops so remember I

672
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
said that perceptual and active

673
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
inference are essentially the same thing

674
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,799
they're the part of this circular

675
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
causality and they see the agent

676
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,799
constantly producing their own worlds

677
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,179
they occupy the states that they're

678
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,400
expecting to through action

679
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,440
and

680
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,539
we might think based on the literature

681
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,279
that I've gone through that there's some

682
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,640
role here for representations so we're

683
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,220
not committing ourselves

684
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,860
um the active inference agent is not one

685
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,140
that fits with very radical

686
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,900
interpretations of inactivism

687
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,919
um and inact active inference agents are

688
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,799
porous they're open to recruiting

689
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
external material features of the

690
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
environment to reduce complexity and

691
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,940
therefore minimize the metabolic costs

692
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,460
of realizing those expected States

693
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,460
okay

694
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
so that was a bit of um active inference

695
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,059
set against the backdrop of some older

696
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,380
questions in philosophy of mine

697
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,960
theoretical cognitive science but I'm

698
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,179
going to jump straight into agency and

699
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,679
motivation now because there's a lot to

700
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,539
get through here

701
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,460
um I'm going to start with a dark room

702
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,640
problem this is a canonical

703
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,200
philosophical worry in active inference

704
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,820
so a lot of people I think will be

705
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,279
familiar with this and in really brief

706
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,440
terms it's really easy to State

707
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,960
um The Challenge here is to say

708
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,120
if it's all about minimizing prediction

709
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,039
error why don't we just find the most

710
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,900
predictable environments possible and

711
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,059
stay there and live a nice error-free

712
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,020
life

713
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,840
so Andy Clark paints a picture of a dark

714
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,179
room and you can just be strapped up to

715
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,640
a to a intravenous drip feeding you the

716
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,260
nutrients you need and you can just be

717
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,520
really happy

718
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,799
but clearly we don't do that

719
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,140
um active inference or sorry agents in

720
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,020
the world us we uh generally typically

721
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,120
sometimes we do enjoy dark rooms but

722
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,500
most of the time we don't for any

723
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,200
extended period of time and so there's a

724
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
challenge here about how active

725
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
inference can account for what appear to

726
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,179
be motivated agential actions that

727
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,340
necessarily mean we're confronted with

728
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,039
some degree of uncertainty

729
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,960
um and I'm going to set active inference

730
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,179
up in a kind of dialectic with folk

731
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,520
psychology here because folk psychology

732
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,279
faces No Such concerns

733
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,140
um so to be very clear folk psychology

734
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,640
is just the kind of propositional

735
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,100
linguistic framework that the folk use

736
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,559
to talk about and describe motivated

737
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,740
action so it's a language we typically

738
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,320
use every day to describe the reasons

739
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,559
people are doing things so uh folk

740
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,179
psychology has this belief desire

741
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,940
intention schema where if I want to

742
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,100
explain my friend

743
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,860
um going to grab a beer I would say my

744
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,600
friend believes there's beer in the

745
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,539
fridge my friend desires beer and so

746
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,760
those are combined to form the intention

747
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,799
to go and get beer so folk psychology

748
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,760
doesn't have these kinds of problems

749
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,559
um so just a little bit more on the dark

750
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,559
room problem and another whale

751
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,140
um so the dark room problem invites more

752
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,640
than one answer we're going to see more

753
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,220
than one answer to it as we go along

754
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,440
um one response is to talk about what

755
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
drives curiosity and play and

756
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,220
exploration and we're gonna we are gonna

757
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,559
see more of that but the First Response

758
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,960
offered by friston Thornton and Clark is

759
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,640
to highlight the fact that organisms

760
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,640
have basic needs to eat drink and

761
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,220
reproduce what you might call

762
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,320
evolutionarily ingrained needs and that

763
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,940
those needs are going to necessitate

764
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,520
some form of exploratory Behavior so

765
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,460
staying in the dark room will inevitably

766
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,159
under most circumstances going to lead

767
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,900
to physical dissipation

768
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,960
so the question is are these kinds of

769
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,620
appeals enough

770
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,240
and I wanted to pull up a paper by Colin

771
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,000
Klein 2018 that I think is like a really

772
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,620
nice articulation of these challenges

773
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,720
ultimately I think he's wrong and it

774
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,000
falls flat but I think it's a strong

775
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,380
articulation

776
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,919
so Klein argues that predictions alone

777
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:33,120
simply can't account for the

778
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,159
motivational character of these needs so

779
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:37,260
Klein says look it's fine that you've

780
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,299
got these needs nobody's going to deny

781
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,520
that but you just have this one

782
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,159
primitive to describe

783
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,679
how those needs motivate you and

784
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,419
prediction is just not going to do it so

785
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,520
prediction alone as your sole primitive

786
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,679
is not going to be able it's like

787
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,299
predicting is not the same thing as

788
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,179
being motivated by something

789
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,840
um and Klein is really not happy with

790
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,919
appeals to these phenotypic needs and he

791
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,440
construes these in the relevance of The

792
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,960
evolutionary history of the organism and

793
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,000
goes into a little bit of detail so he

794
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,880
says look you're right these

795
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,840
expectations are either going to be

796
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,500
about States possible States so the

797
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,100
state of being fed or clothed or warm or

798
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,240
they're going to be about State

799
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,399
transitions about what the appropriate

800
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,860
action is in one state to move to

801
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,940
another state

802
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,000
and he says expectations about States

803
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,880
themselves aren't going to work because

804
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,159
you have this problem of accounting for

805
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,799
novelty so it might be the case that in

806
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,679
my evolutionary past all of my ancestors

807
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
have had the same expectations about

808
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,600
which states they're going to occupy but

809
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,240
there are lots of states in my life that

810
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,120
I could be motivated to occupy that

811
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,919
there's simply no evolutionary history

812
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,899
to account for

813
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,000
and he says there's a very similar or a

814
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,340
similarly difficult problem with State

815
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,980
transitions where essentially what we're

816
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,779
talking about with State transitions the

817
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,720
most appropriate actions so I have

818
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,880
expectations about the actions that are

819
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,679
going to fill for that I need to take

820
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,140
under certain circumstances that are

821
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,120
going to get me to a particular expected

822
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,360
State and uh Klein's worry is that

823
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,500
there's just going to be too many

824
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,779
possible actions in any given situation

825
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,059
so there's just a kind of

826
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,240
um a kind of explosion that's just going

827
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,279
to be unaccountable for there's just

828
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,320
going to be too many different ways of

829
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,779
getting to an expected State

830
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,419
um that won't be uh we won't be able to

831
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,520
account for in our past

832
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,740
so it's fairly

833
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,220
robust thorough challenge you've built

834
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,559
on the dark room problem and I think

835
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,779
actually there are it's a worry with two

836
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,600
faces so I think

837
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,880
um the first is about how active

838
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,399
inference can describe agential Behavior

839
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,620
with its ostia purely docsastic

840
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,200
landscape so if you imagine

841
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,760
um somebody looking at their house

842
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,059
burning down it seems like you need more

843
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,940
than beliefs to explain any course of

844
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,620
action they take so there has to be

845
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,260
desire in there somewhere so this is an

846
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,179
example Andy Clark uses in one of his

847
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,720
papers and he says you know um

848
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,080
the desire to run in and rescue some

849
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,360
kind of some item that you want from the

850
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,580
house or the desire to claim on the

851
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,919
insurance is the thing that's going to

852
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,720
dictate how you explain the person's

853
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,539
Behavior so that's the first problem we

854
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:40,080
need to look at how folk psychology uh

855
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,960
tessellates with uh prediction

856
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,940
and the other problem is maybe a little

857
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,220
bit maybe a little bit deeper and that's

858
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,020
to ask how does active inference

859
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,419
actually account for agential Behavior

860
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,659
so can we even tell some story using

861
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,279
just predictions and prediction error

862
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:01,140
about what really moves agents to act

863
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,600
so firstly thinking about folk

864
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,580
psychology there's a couple of ways to

865
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,679
go here and I think ultimately we can

866
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,120
answer this worry

867
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,080
so Ryan Smith and colleagues in 2022

868
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,880
um in their paper active inference

869
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,640
models do not contradict folk psychology

870
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,220
they argue that the formalisms of active

871
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,740
inference can accommodate a belief

872
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,120
desire distinction

873
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,760
now I'll admit the that's a very math

874
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,679
heavy paper and it's a little bit beyond

875
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,140
my capabilities but the claim here is

876
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,640
simply that there's no contradiction

877
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,580
that actually the worry that the

878
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,840
important thing we have in folk

879
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,179
psychology is desire and we're not

880
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,039
getting that in active inference this is

881
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,080
just an unfounded worry

882
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,720
but there's another strategy as well so

883
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,080
Joe Dewhurst in his 2017 paper he

884
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,880
employs a different strategy and he says

885
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
look what are we even doing with folk

886
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,220
psychology let's not kind of be too

887
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,480
hasty

888
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,159
um and we we need to think about what

889
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,679
are we doing when we talk about these uh

890
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,860
these propositional kind of States

891
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,019
um so he says the first option is to say

892
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,119
well we're just being realists here so

893
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,839
when I say that X desires y I'm actually

894
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,780
positing the real existence of a

895
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,679
fine-grained mental state in ex's head

896
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,418
and he thinks that this is actually the

897
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,859
wrong way to think about things he

898
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,260
thinks that folk psychology actually

899
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,960
it's an instrumentalist tool it's a kind

900
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,179
of framework that we use just for

901
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,219
picking out course grained behavioral

902
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:35,040
patterns in some useful way

903
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,379
so if we agree with Dewhurst here and we

904
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,119
just become instrumentalists about folk

905
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,399
psychology again it looks as though

906
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,500
there's different um we don't we're not

907
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,440
forced to kind of worry that

908
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,639
um there's some kind of empirical

909
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,619
problem here where the mechanisms of

910
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,099
active inference are in some sense

911
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,139
incommensurable with real properties

912
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,119
that we're positing the existence of

913
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,440
because we're just going to say that

914
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,000
those things don't really exist in the

915
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,099
way that we've typically assumed that

916
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,140
that they might

917
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,880
um so either way

918
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,560
um whichever route you go down here it

919
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,079
looks like active inference agents have

920
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,660
beliefs and that we can we we're going

921
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,940
to be fine in describing motivated

922
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,359
action

923
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,680
so what about the second problem

924
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,740
so Andy Clark in 2020 authored a direct

925
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,960
response decline

926
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,140
um so Clark wants to argue that actually

927
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,579
using predictions and prediction errors

928
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,040
and uh Precision waiting which I'll

929
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,900
explain in a second

930
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,599
um we can get a picture of agential

931
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,339
action

932
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,660
um

933
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,660
so the first thing Clark does is to

934
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,640
outline the fact that under active

935
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,720
inference we have a very nice well-worn

936
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,940
account of embodied action so in other

937
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,400
words what it takes to actually move the

938
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,200
body to perform different actions is

939
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,780
perfectly folded into active inference

940
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,880
under the same kind of computational

941
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,940
flow of prediction error minimization

942
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,220
just in a nutshell for me to move my arm

943
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,960
what I'm doing is making a prediction

944
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,820
that my arm is in some place and then

945
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,660
minimizing the prediction error

946
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,460
um so once that's on the table Clark

947
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,740
says okay that's fine uh we have this

948
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,300
account of action but that's not really

949
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,520
what Klein means

950
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,500
um so the move clock makes is to appeal

951
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,260
to the hierarchical nested structure of

952
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,720
the generative model and to say that

953
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,480
higher level beliefs which are temporal

954
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,880
about temporally extended future States

955
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,800
these are going to perform a really

956
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,020
important role as a kind of controller

957
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,720
for lower level actions so the idea is

958
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,339
that if I have

959
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:47,220
um a high level temporally extended

960
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,240
expectation to attain a PhD what happens

961
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,220
is that high level belief becomes

962
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,859
unpacked at lower levels in the

963
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,619
hierarchy and what you get are more

964
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,220
fine-grained faster action policies that

965
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,680
the system expects to help support that

966
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,480
higher level expectation

967
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,800
and

968
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,839
there's a mechanism in play here called

969
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,780
Precision weighting which applies to

970
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,579
um prediction error signals because

971
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,320
obviously

972
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,020
um not all of the incoming not all of

973
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,520
the predictions we make about the

974
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,260
environment are going to be equally

975
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,300
important we're not going to have equal

976
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,820
confidence in all of our actions to

977
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,640
bring about an expected State and so

978
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,200
what Precision weighting does is

979
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,880
essentially communicate how much

980
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,579
confidence we have in a particular

981
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,940
action policy to move us into that

982
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,740
expected State under perceptual

983
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,140
inference and precision weighting just

984
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,020
signals how

985
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,820
newsworthy prediction errors are so how

986
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,619
important they are for the system so

987
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,500
Precision weighting drives attention for

988
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,520
example

989
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,900
um when we're talking about predictive

990
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,480
processing but in this case Clark's

991
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,660
claim is that when you have this kind of

992
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,420
nested hierarchy of expectations so you

993
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,880
have temporally extended expectations at

994
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,940
the high level unpacked into a kind of

995
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,480
web of lower level action policies and

996
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,880
precision waiting is kind of modulating

997
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,460
the system's expectations about which of

998
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,440
those policies are most likely to bring

999
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,359
about the expected state

1000
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,440
you get something that looks a lot like

1001
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,760
motivated directed action and agency is

1002
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,240
kind of inherent in this model because

1003
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,060
the agent has to the system rather has

1004
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,980
to model itself

1005
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,300
as a cause of those expected States so

1006
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,280
if I if I have these high level

1007
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,020
expectations

1008
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,960
I in a very inherent way have to model

1009
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,720
my own cause or efficacy to bring about

1010
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,560
those States so on a very low level the

1011
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,079
system has to model some form of agent

1012
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,940
because I can be the cause of change to

1013
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,980
my own sensory States so I can cover my

1014
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,500
own eyes and so on and so forth so kind

1015
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,460
of on this view agency is a latent

1016
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,740
variable in these systems when it's

1017
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,079
making these predictions so it just kind

1018
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,480
of turns up and

1019
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,000
clock argues that you you essentially

1020
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,980
end up with something that looks very

1021
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,540
much like

1022
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,480
um agents on the folk psychology but he

1023
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
thinks this is a better view because we

1024
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,680
end up with a quote different and

1025
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,260
arguably much more unified internal

1026
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,660
architecture trading in a single

1027
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,540
currency so Clark thinks look okay

1028
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,400
Klein's worry is we have this one

1029
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,520
primitive we have just prediction and

1030
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,140
the concern is that we're not going to

1031
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,240
be able to explain agential action but

1032
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,520
actually there are ways that we can

1033
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
appeal to the hierarchical structure of

1034
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
the model and precision waiting and it

1035
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,400
turns out that this is a much more

1036
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,040
elegant picture as well

1037
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,560
but Klein might press the worry and

1038
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,300
anybody listening might kind of think

1039
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,260
well

1040
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,420
we've kind of done some work there but

1041
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,700
why do we expect the things that we

1042
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,340
expect in the first place

1043
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:07,980
[Applause]

1044
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,520
um

1045
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,060
so why is my long-term expectation to

1046
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,280
attain a PhD and not to join the French

1047
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,560
Foreign Legion for example okay what

1048
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,599
means that I expect one thing rather

1049
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,800
than another

1050
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,920
and here Clark just bites a bullet and

1051
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,680
says nobody can explain that what we're

1052
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,300
kind of we've kind of shifted to talking

1053
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,880
about questions about you know spookier

1054
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,460
questions about Free Will and Clark says

1055
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,560
look if this is what you want if this is

1056
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,420
what you're demanding then you have to

1057
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,460
recognize that simply appealing to folk

1058
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,740
psychology doesn't get you that either

1059
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,460
okay so Klein or you know people

1060
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,440
um with these kinds of worries need to

1061
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,420
be careful in how much they demand from

1062
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,880
the from the active inference agent

1063
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
and I think the real answer to that

1064
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,640
question actually this is more

1065
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,200
speculative but the real answer to that

1066
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,640
a deeper answer to these kinds of

1067
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,740
questions will lie in the kinds of

1068
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,940
things that we're going to look at in

1069
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,220
subsequent weeks so for example the

1070
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,500
reason I want I have the expectation to

1071
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,359
attain a PhD rather than join the French

1072
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,060
Foreign Legion is because I exist in a

1073
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,099
particular kind of socio-cultural

1074
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:15,000
landscape with specific norms and a lot

1075
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,180
of my actions and beliefs are tempered

1076
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,700
and shaped by the expectations of people

1077
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,299
around me

1078
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,500
so this is just an overview

1079
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,619
we went over the dark room problem

1080
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,420
um why do we do anything at all if it's

1081
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,099
all about uncertain if it's all about

1082
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,839
certainty and prediction error

1083
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,760
minimization

1084
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,599
um

1085
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,079
this worry I said you can kind of

1086
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,820
um highlight two aspects of this worry

1087
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,760
one is an actual account of agency under

1088
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,220
active inference which we have we have

1089
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,500
this Andy Clark model of agency to do

1090
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,619
with hierarchical nested unfolding

1091
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,720
action policies over time and different

1092
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,420
precision mappings and then we have this

1093
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,220
worry about the relationship with folk

1094
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,300
psychology so how do we describe

1095
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,420
um agential Behavior motivated Behavior

1096
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,859
how do we describe the behavior of

1097
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,220
Agents if we only have recourse to uh

1098
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,578
prediction

1099
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,040
and as we saw there's

1100
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
um one argument here is that actually

1101
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,880
active inference the formalisms can

1102
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,260
accommodate this belief desire

1103
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,480
distinction and the other move that I

1104
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,700
really like is to just say look folk

1105
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,619
psychology is just this instrumental

1106
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:31,740
tool it is in effect a kind of it's part

1107
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,260
of the socio-cultural landscape that we

1108
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,940
use to shape

1109
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,040
um each other's Expectations by this

1110
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,500
putting these labels to explain our

1111
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,839
actions it's a kind of form of active

1112
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,339
influence itself

1113
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,619
so there's this kind of philosophically

1114
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:50,400
interesting debate about folk psychology

1115
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,800
um but we it turns out that everything's

1116
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,280
okay and active inference agents are in

1117
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,920
fact agents with beliefs desires and

1118
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,400
hopes and dreams and so on

1119
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,480
okay

1120
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,660
that's agency moving we're making good

1121
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,839
time

1122
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,160
but

1123
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,460
okay so in this section I'm going to

1124
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,060
introduce quite a lot of stuff

1125
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,400
um but it's going to be all tied

1126
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,260
together hopefully rather neatly in the

1127
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,700
case study at the end I'm going to talk

1128
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,760
about allostasis and emotion I'm going

1129
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,040
to say very very briefly a little bit

1130
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,540
about the self as well

1131
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,800
uh here's some examples of some of the

1132
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,480
core readings I've used again these are

1133
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,520
all going to be up in the document as

1134
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,920
well which will be made available

1135
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,960
um and I thoroughly advise you to just

1136
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,520
have a browse through these there's some

1137
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,619
really interesting stuff there

1138
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,660
um I'm not going to talk about

1139
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,579
um psychedelics or

1140
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:53,160
meditation or depersonalization but

1141
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,260
there is some really really cool active

1142
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,359
inference literature on those topics as

1143
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,460
well particularly papers on psychedelics

1144
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,400
and ego dissolution by George Dean but

1145
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,099
new paper just came out by

1146
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,200
um

1147
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,880
Jonas Mago and Robert Carhartt Harris

1148
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,520
and I think Fernando Rosas as well I

1149
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,619
think I might might be mistaken on the

1150
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,800
authors there but it's a very new paper

1151
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,380
uh okay so the the thing that is going

1152
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,720
to underpin a lot of what I'm now going

1153
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,700
to go on to say is going to be this

1154
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,740
notion of allostasis

1155
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,700
um

1156
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,700
and this plays a major role

1157
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,280
um in a lot of work on emotion and the

1158
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,740
self in active inference Lisa Feldman

1159
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,900
Barrett whose theory of emotion we're

1160
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,819
going to look at in a second has argued

1161
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,700
that the brain's fundamental purpose

1162
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,579
what it evolved to do through that

1163
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,319
imperative to minimize prediction error

1164
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,780
is to manage the body's metabolic budget

1165
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,040
so the first prior is uh kind of our

1166
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,380
most expected State

1167
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,180
um the first prior in the sense of like

1168
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,000
our strongest prior

1169
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,740
um prior probability our highest

1170
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,440
expectation is to have

1171
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,780
um good allostatic control and I'm

1172
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,160
getting ahead of myself there all that

1173
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,079
means is that it's we're balancing our

1174
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,300
body's metabolic budgets or like energy

1175
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,000
budget in a in an effective way

1176
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,920
so

1177
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,380
error signals like I said before that

1178
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,300
are highly precise are those that are

1179
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,839
weighted very highly so prediction error

1180
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:26,819
signals that have high Precision waiting

1181
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:29,819
are the synaptic gain on those error

1182
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,800
signals is going to be increased and

1183
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,140
that's going to drive learning which

1184
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,540
means in future our expectations around

1185
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,400
those kinds of error signals is going to

1186
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,079
be we're going to pay more attention to

1187
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,880
those

1188
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,760
um and the most highly weighted error

1189
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,920
signals that we're going to get are to

1190
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,980
do with our own homeostatic set points

1191
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,640
within our own body okay so if my uh

1192
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,920
temperature started to rise rapidly my

1193
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,079
body temperature started to rise or drop

1194
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,700
rapidly

1195
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,520
um that prediction error signal those

1196
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,040
the violation of those expectations is

1197
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,599
really going to grab my attention and

1198
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,579
I'm going to do something about it okay

1199
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,640
and one way that we maintain these

1200
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,400
homeostatic States is through the body's

1201
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,000
own autonomic reactions so where I to

1202
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
start getting very cold

1203
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,560
um I would probably start to shiver and

1204
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,099
so the body is trying to kind of Rectify

1205
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,140
those deviations from homeostatic set

1206
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,520
points

1207
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,160
but another thing that um organisms

1208
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,640
engage in and humans do this to really

1209
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,619
remarkable degrees and again this is

1210
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,359
going to be something that I suspect is

1211
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,680
going to come out in the subsequent

1212
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,280
weeks is that we engage in uh quite

1213
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,740
complex and sophisticated anticipatory

1214
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,460
actions to maintain homeostasis and this

1215
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,400
is something called allostasis so

1216
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,680
allostatic control which I mentioned

1217
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,339
earlier is this first prior is

1218
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,780
essentially the regulation of

1219
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,420
homeostasis through action so it's

1220
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,319
actions that I can take to ensure that I

1221
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,920
stay within those important bounds so

1222
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,680
shivering is good but living in a house

1223
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,980
with central heating is better having a

1224
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,040
warm bed and living in a community where

1225
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,960
we've had these people of kind of

1226
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,420
Engineers have worked to create a kind

1227
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,119
of material environment that acts as a

1228
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,859
kind of background support to a lot of

1229
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,540
these needs

1230
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,819
um something that's another important

1231
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,060
concept here is allostatic load so this

1232
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,520
is essentially the result of not having

1233
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,619
good allostatic control so again

1234
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,680
allostatic control is just engaging

1235
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,480
effectively in actions that are

1236
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,880
maintaining those set points whereas

1237
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,040
allostatic load is the physiological

1238
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,560
costs to the agent of losing that

1239
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,660
control so

1240
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:58,140
there's so many studies here that have

1241
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:58,800
um

1242
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,200
just shown the immense physiological

1243
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,599
costs of operating Beyond those set

1244
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,760
points and not having good control so

1245
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,599
allostatic load has been linked with

1246
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,900
reduced cardiac health sleep problems

1247
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,500
um uh gut issues mental health issues

1248
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,079
depression uh basically everything it's

1249
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,420
really really really bad and so good

1250
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,480
allostatic control is very important and

1251
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,940
as we're going to see it underpins quite

1252
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,079
a few very important things

1253
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,060
so

1254
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,880
really like we could dedicate a whole

1255
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,700
hour to looking at emotion but I'm going

1256
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,859
to blast through it very very quickly

1257
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:43,020
right now and this slide I should say

1258
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,819
one of the core readings on the document

1259
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,859
and the reading that I'm basing this on

1260
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:50,339
is Lisa Feldman Barrett's 2017 paper the

1261
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:54,300
theory of constructed emotion

1262
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,200
um

1263
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,140
the main idea here is this is a this is

1264
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,760
one of those theories that it on the

1265
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,380
face of it it seems quite simple but

1266
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,940
actually there's quite a lot of subtlety

1267
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,980
and Nuance to it

1268
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,619
um allostatic control means inferring

1269
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,540
the causes of changes to the body's

1270
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,780
internal state so in other words if I

1271
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,780
want to keep good allostatic control I

1272
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,520
need to know what's not just what's

1273
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,200
going on out there but I need to know

1274
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,420
what's going on inside me as well okay

1275
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,099
so if there's some crucial change

1276
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:25,920
happening I need to be on top of it and

1277
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,720
this happens through exactly the same

1278
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,599
process as the same predictive error

1279
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,520
minimization process that I'm engaging

1280
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,220
with with the outside world so the brain

1281
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,680
is making predictions about its own

1282
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,380
internal States and then it's going to

1283
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,200
engage in some kind of action to

1284
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,720
minimize any prediction errors and these

1285
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,859
prediction errors are going to be very

1286
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,800
highly weighted they're very important

1287
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,680
but here's an interesting thing so there

1288
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,760
was a very unethical experiment done by

1289
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,640
uh shakhter and singer I think in the

1290
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,480
60s who they were emotion researchers

1291
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,460
and they conducted an experiment where

1292
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,819
they uh injected uh subjects without the

1293
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,520
subject's knowledge I think

1294
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,680
um they injected them with adrenaline

1295
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,560
and then they exposed the subjects to

1296
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,859
different uh stimuli so some subjects

1297
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:22,200
were exposed to one type of stimulus and

1298
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,900
some subjects were exposed to another

1299
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,000
and even though the subjects

1300
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,280
had essentially been

1301
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,619
um they'd been pushed to have the same

1302
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,180
to experience the same physiological

1303
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,540
changes in their body they reported

1304
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,400
um different emotional like different

1305
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,740
kinds of feelings depended on depending

1306
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,300
on the stimulus that they'd been exposed

1307
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,079
to

1308
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:45,720
so this highlights something really

1309
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,760
important and again I feel compelled to

1310
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,099
say that I am moving through this

1311
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,140
incredibly quickly there's so much to

1312
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,339
say here

1313
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:57,300
but the the nub of it is this in order

1314
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,020
to keep good allostatic control in order

1315
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,720
to know what to do the brain needs to

1316
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,000
contextualize those changes in the body

1317
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,359
because there's not a one-to-one mapping

1318
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,520
between changes in the body and an

1319
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,160
external stimulus okay so sometimes

1320
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,200
changes physiological changes in our

1321
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,480
body are about something in the world

1322
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,180
they're a response to something

1323
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,220
um and it's very very important that the

1324
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,339
brain is kind of taking a Confluence of

1325
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:28,800
those inputs to try and contextualize

1326
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,780
okay what's actually happening and what

1327
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,599
do I need to do so an example of this is

1328
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,359
uh if you imagine running into a bear

1329
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,359
while you're hiking in Wyoming which is

1330
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,740
something that's actually happened to me

1331
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,099
I've experienced it it's terrifying and

1332
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,500
you imagine going on a scary or a date

1333
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,440
that you're really nervous about

1334
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,599
the physiological changes that are

1335
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,300
happening in the body are give or take

1336
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,260
more or less the same so perspiration

1337
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,740
elevated heart rate breathing changes

1338
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,780
um so the underlying physiological

1339
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,599
footprint is very very very similar but

1340
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,880
what you need to do to manage that

1341
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,339
situation that apt action is very very

1342
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:14,640
different and so the claim here the kind

1343
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,559
of the kind of revolutionary claim in a

1344
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,500
way is that emotions

1345
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,740
the things we experience subjectively

1346
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,140
are constructions just like percepts are

1347
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,359
so just like my experience of the car

1348
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,280
when I step outside my flat is a

1349
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,520
construction that explains away the

1350
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,200
prediction error and gives me a cleaned

1351
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,500
up picture of the world emotions are

1352
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,880
essentially doing the same thing they're

1353
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,859
explaining away these prediction errors

1354
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,319
and telling me this is the best

1355
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:46,140
explanation of these changes within your

1356
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,480
body contextualized against this

1357
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,180
external stimulus so in the case of the

1358
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,140
date

1359
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,339
apt action is to like chill out and be

1360
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,040
normal right to a certain extent and in

1361
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,020
the case of the bear it's you get the

1362
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,819
hell out of that although interestingly

1363
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,740
you don't running away from a bear is a

1364
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,059
terrible idea

1365
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:07,680
um you should not turn your back and run

1366
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,020
away but you get the idea that it's

1367
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,819
going to be what you should do in each

1368
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,940
situation is completely different

1369
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,359
so that's emotion for the active

1370
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,280
inference agent it's

1371
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,079
and something I don't want to I don't

1372
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,880
want to lose here is

1373
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,000
what you get with this is really kind of

1374
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,339
cool because it turns out emotions and

1375
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,140
subjects subject we're kind of moving

1376
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,359
into subjectivity here it turns out

1377
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,640
emotions are really

1378
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,359
um

1379
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,579
they're just part of the same cognitive

1380
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,619
architecture so there's no difference

1381
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,319
here there's no dualism between his

1382
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,540
thinking and here's emotion and emotion

1383
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,599
is this kind of fuzzy stuff uh that

1384
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,339
we're not really interested in actually

1385
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,359
emotion subjective embodied feeling is

1386
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:57,300
core it's absolutely vital to

1387
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,160
understanding how we

1388
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,680
maintain this allostatic control and how

1389
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,260
we engage in adaptive behaviors and how

1390
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,040
we remain gripped to our affordances in

1391
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,900
the environment and the notion of grip

1392
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,520
is going to be something that comes up

1393
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,300
again very soon

1394
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,180
so very very briefly

1395
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,619
because this is something that I've

1396
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,240
really already talked about but I want

1397
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,740
to put a slightly different spin on it

1398
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,059
right now

1399
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:24,960
um

1400
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,180
I've already said the allostatic control

1401
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,540
for humans can involve very very

1402
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,220
temporally extended time scales and we

1403
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,980
saw this with Andy's model of uh agency

1404
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,960
so if you think about something like

1405
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,059
saving into a retirement fund for

1406
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,040
example okay we're doing something that

1407
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,559
the idea is that maybe decades from now

1408
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,040
is gonna kind of uh minor spikes in

1409
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,119
prediction error called the

1410
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,800
disappointment of having not having as

1411
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,420
much money right now is going to pay off

1412
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,380
later

1413
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,180
these are the kind of things that that

1414
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,460
humans engage in and our generative

1415
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,220
models have to be temporally thick

1416
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,319
so that George Dean writes that the

1417
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:02,940
levels of temporal extension are

1418
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,640
hierarchically interlocked so shorter

1419
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,400
time scales inform expectations of what

1420
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,559
the agent can do over longer time scales

1421
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,900
so these different levels of the

1422
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,640
hierarchy are in a kind of dialogue with

1423
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,980
each other telling you what kinds of

1424
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,660
things are possible and what kinds of

1425
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,460
things you should expect

1426
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,059
and when we were talking about agency we

1427
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,700
talked about the way that agencies kind

1428
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,220
of baked into active inference because

1429
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,200
in order for any of this to work the

1430
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,680
system has to have as a hypothesis I can

1431
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,200
do things okay

1432
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,559
um and this is uh more or less taken to

1433
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,180
be the same

1434
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,640
um the same thing that underpins the

1435
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,760
sense of self under active inference so

1436
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,460
the system implicitly refer infers its

1437
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,140
own ability to bring about intended

1438
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,260
sensory consequences and so Dean writes

1439
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,140
here quote in Princeton it is in this

1440
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,260
sense that implicit in a model of

1441
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,200
sampling is a representation or sense of

1442
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,000
agency

1443
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,740
so

1444
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,559
a minimal sense of self it's kind of

1445
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,540
like the flip side of agency comes baked

1446
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,280
in here so

1447
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,260
one has to model oneself as a potential

1448
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,099
cause of sensory inputs so George Dean

1449
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,440
and colleagues I think George Dean Mark

1450
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,160
Miller and Sam Wilkinson propose a model

1451
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,780
of the self and the active inference

1452
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,780
called the allostatic control model

1453
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,599
um and the move they make here is that

1454
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,599
we have to recognize that it's not just

1455
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,420
our self-efficacy that has to be modeled

1456
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,540
we also have to have some kind of idea

1457
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,119
in there of how we're actually doing so

1458
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,880
we have to model our own capabilities in

1459
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,619
order to set Precision waiting on future

1460
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:54,000
action

1461
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,280
um so we don't simply infer that we can

1462
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,800
be the cause of sensory States but also

1463
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,660
infer our own capabilities to

1464
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,579
successfully bring about expected States

1465
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,040
at longer time scales so the the

1466
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,500
phrasing that they use is tracking the

1467
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,260
performance or Fitness of the model over

1468
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,160
time

1469
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,559
so

1470
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,000
part of that tracking is going to be

1471
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,280
affective and emotional and so there are

1472
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,900
strong links we're kind of really

1473
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,819
digging our hooks into subjectivity at

1474
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:26,119
this point

1475
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,859
but the the claim with the allostatic

1476
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:31,559
control model is you get this rather

1477
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,420
than just a minimal self you actually

1478
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,480
get a longer term phenomenological self

1479
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,579
emerge from these interlocking time

1480
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:42,059
scales which are modeling not only the

1481
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,280
system the agent's own causal efficacy

1482
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,819
but also modeling how good your own

1483
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:51,780
model is at doing what you need it to do

1484
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,819
and like I said I said when I was

1485
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:55,740
talking about the reading I and I want

1486
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,059
to flag this again

1487
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,220
um because I've really really not doing

1488
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,480
Justice

1489
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,579
um to this in the way that I should but

1490
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,500
this has formed the basis for a lot of

1491
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,180
really interesting work on phenomena

1492
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,700
like depersonalization

1493
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,940
[Music]

1494
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,160
um on the role of psychedelics and the

1495
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,960
potential for psychedelics in therapy

1496
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,500
and in meditation ego dissolution and

1497
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,020
kind of um that kind of stuff in in

1498
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,079
meditative settings so anybody with any

1499
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,780
interest in the self or in those kinds

1500
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,059
of practices should definitely go and

1501
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:29,760
give a closer look to these readings

1502
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,200
stood up I'll make sure in the document

1503
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,359
okay so quick overview here

1504
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:38,940
so active inference agents maintain

1505
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,460
homeostasis through anticipatory action

1506
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,500
and this is something we call allostatic

1507
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,020
control to do this the system must

1508
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,660
engage in interceptive prediction over

1509
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,960
its own internal States and I actually I

1510
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,339
kind of I think I've got time to do this

1511
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:55,559
so I'll just deviate slightly

1512
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,079
um the topic of interceptive inference

1513
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,660
is really interesting in the context of

1514
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,819
active inference so I I want to flag

1515
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:05,760
work by Sarah garfinkel uh who I believe

1516
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,839
is at UCL who used to be at Sussex and

1517
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,960
um Professor garfinkel's work looks at

1518
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,160
um the the central importance of uh

1519
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,299
interceptive predictions in various

1520
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:22,260
psychopathologies especially I think

1521
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,540
she's looked very closely at PTSD and

1522
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:29,819
anxiety disorders and it turns out that

1523
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:33,000
an agent's accuracy in their

1524
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,280
introspective predictions is a good

1525
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,859
indicator as to the kinds of symptoms

1526
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:39,660
that they're gonna like the strength and

1527
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,400
severity of their symptoms in these

1528
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,200
kinds of disorders

1529
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,839
um and what she's shown is that if you

1530
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,540
can increase the accuracy of

1531
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,720
interceptive predictions this forms the

1532
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,660
basis of treatment for these symptoms so

1533
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,299
in short the better you are at

1534
00:59:57,299 --> 00:59:59,880
interceptive predicting I think one of

1535
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,859
the measures that they use there in her

1536
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:05,460
lab is how well people can track their

1537
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,260
own heartbeats without feeling their

1538
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,660
pulse so if you just sit there and try

1539
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,240
and say like do do my heart's beating

1540
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,040
like this then the more accurate you are

1541
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,799
and the more any training you can be

1542
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,559
given to be more accurate it forms the

1543
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:22,079
basis of effective treatments for these

1544
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,579
kinds of symptoms

1545
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:26,099
um so I just wanted to flag that because

1546
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,280
the world of research on in in

1547
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,520
interceptive inferences uh large diverse

1548
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,339
vibrant super interesting and very much

1549
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:37,680
worth our time

1550
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,680
um okay where was I here okay so to to

1551
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,720
maintain other static control the system

1552
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,760
has to engage in interceptive prediction

1553
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,940
over its internal States and then to

1554
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,579
best explain changes in those internal

1555
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:53,599
States the system has to contextualize

1556
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,059
those changes against some extra

1557
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:01,079
receptive uh input and that's emotion

1558
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:04,260
categories serve that role so just to be

1559
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,599
very clear on this view this emotions

1560
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,760
are constructions

1561
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,380
um there are some important deviations

1562
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,799
from other theories of emotion here

1563
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,260
um particularly what uh Barrett calls

1564
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,020
the basic theory of emotion

1565
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,240
um so on her view emotions themselves

1566
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,059
have no underlying kind of essence or

1567
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,660
neural Footprints and there's a ongoing

1568
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,579
live debate there as well between these

1569
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:31,880
theories

1570
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,880
and also just at the end

1571
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,680
um

1572
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,540
the good out of static control in human

1573
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,020
agents is this very temporally thick uh

1574
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,420
phenomena so we engage in very long-term

1575
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,920
planning that involves a lot of the

1576
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,740
kinds of counterfactual representations

1577
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,940
that we talked about with the actual

1578
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,119
constant paper and this has hypothesized

1579
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:55,760
to form the basis of our

1580
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,480
phenomenological sense of self

1581
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,260
okay

1582
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,020
so

1583
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,299
okay we're up to an hour

1584
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:10,020
um good we're running on time uh this is

1585
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,480
the final section and

1586
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,740
um it's probably going to be probably

1587
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,839
going to be the longest section what I

1588
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:19,559
want to do here is I want to introduce

1589
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:20,280
um

1590
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,200
I want to try and pull together some of

1591
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,099
the things I've been talking about

1592
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:25,380
because it's been very fast and very

1593
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,780
abstract and I want to try and pull some

1594
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,160
of these things together in a slightly

1595
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,260
more concrete example so the case study

1596
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,839
I'm going to use is addiction so there's

1597
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,700
a particular account of addiction in the

1598
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,500
predictive process in literature that I

1599
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,220
think

1600
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,359
in a very succinct Sharp Way highlights

1601
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,500
a lot of the things I've been talking

1602
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,359
about and puts them within a context

1603
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,000
that is quite Stark and easy to

1604
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,260
understand

1605
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,180
um but in order to do that I'm going to

1606
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,559
have to introduce

1607
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,540
a new

1608
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,640
um slightly more difficult to understand

1609
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,980
mechanism within the framework that

1610
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,599
crops up in a lot of the predictive

1611
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,880
process in literature and what this is

1612
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,980
going to do hopefully as well is give us

1613
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,400
some a direct bridge to phenomenology so

1614
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,059
when we talk about things like neuro

1615
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,520
computational phenomenology

1616
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,559
um this the things I'm going to be

1617
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,780
talking about here have underpinned a

1618
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,400
lot of the a lot of the work in that

1619
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,980
area

1620
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,420
so these are some of the readings we're

1621
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:28,079
going to look at some work by uh mostly

1622
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,280
um a lot of the papers we're going to

1623
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,040
look at uh first author Mark Miller or

1624
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,900
Mark Miller's been the second or third

1625
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,059
author and I bring that up because in

1626
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:38,579
the discussion section

1627
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:41,280
um on the 25th when we have an hour to

1628
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,500
kind of unpack and answer people's

1629
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,700
questions we're actually going to be

1630
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,280
joined by Mark Miller so if anybody has

1631
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,200
any specific questions about the things

1632
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,819
I'm going to talk about now in this

1633
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:52,140
section

1634
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,640
um he's going to be the man to answer

1635
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,500
those

1636
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,599
um but also I'm going to put a lot of

1637
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,400
secondary readings up again in the in

1638
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,420
the document

1639
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,559
um so you'll be able to find them all

1640
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:03,299
there

1641
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,339
Okay so

1642
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:09,240
let's suppose switch gears slightly

1643
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,619
um

1644
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:13,260
I want to keep the focus on

1645
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,540
feelings although what I'm going to be

1646
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,359
talking about here are not what might be

1647
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:21,180
called like full-blooded emotion States

1648
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,380
um but I want to talk talk about

1649
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,540
something a little bit more subtle so

1650
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,299
one thing that might seem really really

1651
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:31,140
obvious kind of so obvious that we often

1652
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,500
Overlook it when things are going okay

1653
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,359
is that it generally feels like

1654
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:39,540
something to be an agent so when we're

1655
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,339
going about whatever business we have in

1656
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:42,720
the world

1657
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,619
um

1658
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,160
we always feel like something

1659
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,680
and it's not entirely clear how best to

1660
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,859
characterize that so I want to draw on

1661
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:55,920
some work in phenomenology that some

1662
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,020
active inference theorists have also

1663
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,780
drawn on and made use of because I think

1664
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,780
this is a really good grounding for some

1665
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,000
of the things I'm going to go on to say

1666
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,319
um certainly proved to be a good

1667
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:09,480
grounding for some of the work that I'm

1668
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,619
going to highlight

1669
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:14,520
so these are two books by uh

1670
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,799
Matthew Ratcliffe who I think is at the

1671
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,040
University of York and has done really

1672
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,619
really cool work in kind of really

1673
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,599
getting to grips with the what it's

1674
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:28,940
likeness to live in certain conditions

1675
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,520
and Radcliffe has he argues that he's

1676
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,000
identified this certain area uh this

1677
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,760
space of feelings that have been largely

1678
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,579
neglected in The Wider literature and he

1679
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:45,059
describes these as existential feelings

1680
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:46,880
um so he says

1681
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,280
existential feelings are uh quote they

1682
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,559
are not intentional States directed at

1683
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,960
however many objects and they are not

1684
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,540
feelings or of the body or some part of

1685
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,119
it instead they amount to a felt sense

1686
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:02,780
of belonging in the world so the main

1687
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,980
difference between a full-blooded

1688
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,960
emotion State and an existential feeling

1689
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,720
is that the emotion state is about

1690
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,140
something okay so if I'm uh disgusted

1691
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,200
I'm typically well all the time I'm

1692
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,240
disgusted about something in the world

1693
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,400
okay so emotions are intentional in that

1694
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,540
way

1695
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,400
um

1696
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,740
Radcliffe elaborates on existential

1697
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,240
Feelings by

1698
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,559
um I'm going to quote this at length

1699
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,140
because I quite like it he says

1700
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,359
people sometimes talk of feeling alive

1701
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,740
dead distance detached dislodged

1702
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:39,980
estranged isolated otherworldly

1703
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,960
indifferent to everything

1704
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,480
overwhelmed suffocated cut off lost

1705
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,559
disconnected out of sorts not oneself

1706
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:52,319
out of touch with things out of it not

1707
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,079
quite with it separate in harmony with

1708
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:58,140
things at peace with things there are

1709
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,000
reference to feelings of unreality

1710
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,200
heightened existence surreality

1711
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,660
familiarity unfamiliarity strangeness

1712
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,260
isolation emptiness belonging being at

1713
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,940
home in the world being at one with

1714
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,940
things significance insignificance and

1715
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,680
the list goes on

1716
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,539
so

1717
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,240
this is uh this really really cool work

1718
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,579
and I recommend everybody to go and read

1719
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:25,619
Matthew Ratcliffe but um some of the

1720
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:26,940
work I really like in predictive

1721
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,280
processing and active inference has

1722
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,960
taken this idea of an existential

1723
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,640
feeling and what they've recognized is

1724
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,039
that these kinds of feelings are really

1725
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,339
about how we are orientated in regards

1726
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,380
to the world and the affordances in it

1727
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,020
so their their background bodily states

1728
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,900
of action Readiness so how are we

1729
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,480
relating to

1730
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,460
um like how do we find ourselves in

1731
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,619
relation to the world so we're talking

1732
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:54,720
about the general structuring that's

1733
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,880
present in our everyday phenomenology

1734
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,039
okay so I really want to make that clear

1735
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,319
that what this work is doing is building

1736
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:04,680
a bridge between computational models

1737
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,200
and the way even the underpinnings of

1738
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,539
those models in neurobiology and

1739
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:12,359
phenomenological experience

1740
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:14,579
so the thing that I need to introduce

1741
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,679
and this can be uh it's fairly

1742
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:18,000
straightforward but it can be a little a

1743
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,920
little bit tricky at times is this

1744
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,259
notion of aerodynamics okay this is

1745
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,600
really important so like I just said

1746
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,520
aerodynamics is going to provide this

1747
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,020
conceptual bridge between different

1748
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,920
levels of analysis and it elaborates on

1749
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,738
how systems are sensitive to the success

1750
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:37,799
or failure of their own action policies

1751
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,920
unfolding across multiple time scales so

1752
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,319
the recognition here is that we talk a

1753
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,080
lot about action policies and expected

1754
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,500
States but the reality is that we have a

1755
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,799
multitude of goals and action policies

1756
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,899
and expected states that are

1757
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:57,299
interlocking overlapping constantly

1758
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,600
shifting okay the picture is messy and

1759
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,160
so I like this quote

1760
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,420
from the 2019 paper that says the roller

1761
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,279
coaster of continual increases and

1762
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,380
decreases of errors that accompany life

1763
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,439
become expected and are folded into our

1764
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,839
expectations for such a system it

1765
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,939
becomes important not only to track the

1766
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:20,160
constantly fluctuating instantaneous

1767
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,979
errors but also to pay attention to the

1768
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:25,319
Dynamics of error reduction over longer

1769
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:26,580
time scales

1770
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,580
so the systems the upshot of this is

1771
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,859
that these authors believe building on

1772
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:33,779
some other work in computational

1773
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:36,779
modeling that systems must track the

1774
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:39,299
rate of change in overall error

1775
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:41,399
reduction relative to the system's

1776
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:44,100
expectations so this is

1777
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,640
um the kind of global upwards or

1778
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,679
downwards Trend in prediction error

1779
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,899
that's what the system is sensitive to

1780
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:54,060
sensitive to how that relates to the

1781
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,660
expectations

1782
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,260
so

1783
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,560
the idea here is that aerodynamics

1784
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,420
provide a system with a much broader

1785
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,480
ongoing sense of how they're doing to

1786
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,719
their multitude of goals over time

1787
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:11,699
so

1788
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:14,400
a big step here is that those changes in

1789
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,340
the rate of reduction feed back into the

1790
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,560
system so they're folded back within the

1791
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,080
system and they serve the role of

1792
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,300
modulating Precision on action policies

1793
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,820
so let's say I'm

1794
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,640
engaged in some tasks I have a

1795
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,560
particular expectation about how I'm

1796
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,060
going to do it that task

1797
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,860
and when I actually engage with the task

1798
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,219
I do slightly worse than expected

1799
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:40,620
the idea there is that

1800
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,679
that rate of change so the rate of error

1801
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,679
error reduction is going to decrease

1802
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,719
until I'm reducing error worse than my

1803
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,600
expectations and in a typical healthily

1804
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,580
functioning system that rate of change

1805
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,320
the sensitivity to that rate of change

1806
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,840
is going to feed back and reset the

1807
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,580
Precision waiting on those actions so

1808
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,540
it's gonna

1809
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,900
reduce my confidence in that particular

1810
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,300
action policy such that I might try a

1811
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,860
different strategy I might try a

1812
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,500
different tactic or I might you know I

1813
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,360
might just throw whatever it is that I'm

1814
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,860
doing away and go and do something else

1815
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,080
so it's we're starting to see this

1816
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,679
picture of through expectations

1817
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:22,260
sensitivity to change and feedback onto

1818
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,219
Precision waiting it's starting to

1819
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:28,920
dictate how I manage my action policies

1820
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,320
so there's this ongoing reciprocal

1821
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,020
relationship between aerodynamics and my

1822
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:37,500
future expectations now crucially the

1823
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,440
claim here is that on the subject level

1824
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,020
all of this manifests as these

1825
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,020
existential feelings of some kind so the

1826
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,420
way that I feel on a kind of day-to-day

1827
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,960
basis is a reflection of how I'm doing

1828
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,179
in terms of these sensitivity to

1829
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:57,679
aerodynamics so when I fail at the task

1830
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,659
and precision waiting is down regulated

1831
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:03,179
on that particular action policy the

1832
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:06,000
thing that actually that kind of oomph

1833
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,560
that moves me to go and do something

1834
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,500
else my embodied feelings of frustration

1835
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,560
that I experience so our as conscious

1836
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,679
agents those embodied feelings are what

1837
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:18,840
are tuning us towards acting more

1838
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,880
effectively

1839
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,760
so optimal behavior on this account is

1840
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,800
characterized as a feeling of a feeling

1841
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,260
of grip towards a shifting field of

1842
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,060
affordances so I'm going to unpack this

1843
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,580
quickly but the feeling of grip in a

1844
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,159
nutshell is just this feeling that we're

1845
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,739
engaging with our affordances in the

1846
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:39,600
best way that we can and that we're

1847
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,820
either meeting or exceeding our

1848
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,340
expectations for prediction error

1849
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,560
minimization and what they mean by a

1850
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,320
field of affordances and this is again

1851
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,360
really important

1852
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,640
um a landscape of affordances is just

1853
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,280
the total opportunities in my niche so

1854
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,620
my landscape of affordances right now is

1855
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,020
Brighton okay it's not really going to

1856
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,640
change very quickly unless I get on a

1857
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,980
plane and fly somewhere else

1858
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,100
but affordances aren't neutral in that

1859
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,040
way they don't just exist there

1860
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,860
the affordances that stand out to me as

1861
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,140
relevant or attractive

1862
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,820
is going to change quite rapidly

1863
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,040
depending on what it is I'm doing on my

1864
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,040
internal State on the context and so on

1865
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,800
so right now my water bottle stands out

1866
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,020
as attractive a couple of keys on my

1867
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,060
keyboard stand out as attractive but

1868
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,980
that's going to shift quite rapidly once

1869
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,600
this lecture is over and I turn to do

1870
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,300
something else so the idea of grip is

1871
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,060
that we are kind of we exhibit a

1872
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,060
stability in our Attunement such that we

1873
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:46,560
can remain attuned as that field changes

1874
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,540
um and this is part of the skilled

1875
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,940
intentionality framework which I I won't

1876
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,140
get into because I don't want

1877
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,659
theoretical overload but I've put some

1878
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:57,120
papers up on this slide as references

1879
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,159
and of course the reading will be in the

1880
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:00,480
document

1881
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,659
um but skilled intentionality refers to

1882
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:05,100
the selective openness and

1883
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,560
responsiveness to multiple relevant

1884
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,440
affordances in a concrete situation so

1885
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,239
it's just this recognition that things

1886
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,760
change quickly

1887
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,620
for multiple reasons and we really need

1888
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,840
to exhibit a kind of flexibility and

1889
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,840
stability in those engagements

1890
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,500
and aerodynamics has been applied in

1891
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,080
lots of very very cool ways I can't

1892
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,300
recommend this work highly enough

1893
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,480
so aerodynamics I won't run through

1894
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,460
how everything has been explained just

1895
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:38,340
for time reasons but um you can kind of

1896
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,600
take a look at this yourself but

1897
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,020
aerodynamics has been proposed as a a

1898
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,760
more complete answer to the dark room

1899
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,080
problem that we were talking about

1900
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,780
earlier because it can explain the drive

1901
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,260
for exploration and curiosity because it

1902
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,239
literally feels good to minimize

1903
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,280
prediction errors better than expected

1904
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,440
okay so again that rate of change

1905
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,800
manifests as embodied feeling so

1906
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,120
um we're always looking for

1907
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,280
opportunities to do better than expected

1908
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,500
okay and kind of this has been suggested

1909
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,620
to account for feelings of boredom

1910
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,820
prompting us to go out and find new

1911
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,880
things to do and similarly aerodynamics

1912
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,699
has provided a computational account of

1913
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:20,760
play which is for a while has remained a

1914
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,920
kind of mystery because it's on the face

1915
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,020
of it like why would we engage in play

1916
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,719
when it's metabolically costly and we

1917
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:29,699
need that energy for other things you

1918
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:31,320
know like Lisa film and Barrett says

1919
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,480
like managing energy is super important

1920
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,219
so why do baby animals burn it all

1921
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:39,980
engaging in playful Behavior

1922
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:42,179
aerodynamics has a has a story for us

1923
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:44,640
the there and there are also

1924
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,280
aerodynamics based accounts of happiness

1925
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,820
and well-being and depression as well so

1926
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,860
I won't go into the details there but it

1927
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,659
turns out that aerodynamics and this

1928
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:56,880
connection to phenomenology is this

1929
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,520
super malleable flexible

1930
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,560
um kind of uh feature of the framework

1931
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,920
that really underpins a lot of what we

1932
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,500
experience and do as active inference

1933
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,940
agents

1934
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,940
okay

1935
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,880
so I'm gonna

1936
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,280
talk a little bit about addiction

1937
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,780
um

1938
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:21,360
got some time here things are going well

1939
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,800
um

1940
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,739
so I take

1941
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:27,780
um so so I had some options here because

1942
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,239
I wanted to use a case study that really

1943
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,580
brought out uh some of the things I was

1944
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,620
talking about and as I've just said

1945
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,540
aerodynamics has been applied in a bunch

1946
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,600
of different areas and it's all very

1947
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,159
much worth talking about but I chose

1948
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:43,320
addiction because

1949
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,260
uh well as you'll see as I as I kind of

1950
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,600
make clear I think it also brings out

1951
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,580
not just the way that all of this fits

1952
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,980
together but also why it's good

1953
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:56,280
and why seeing people as active

1954
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,980
inference agents and broader structures

1955
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,460
as active inference structures is

1956
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,219
actually a worthwhile thing to do

1957
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:08,940
so addiction was once viewed as a moral

1958
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,020
failing

1959
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,780
um so the kind of Victorian addict is

1960
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,940
too rotten to make the right choice to

1961
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,500
self-indulgent

1962
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,380
I say Victorian unless you're Peter

1963
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,239
Hitchens and then you still subscribe to

1964
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,320
this view

1965
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:22,920
um

1966
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,900
but that's the old-fashioned view okay

1967
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,159
there was something wrong with the

1968
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,900
addict some moral or spiritual feeling

1969
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,480
and gradually that changed to what the

1970
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,100
dominant view is today which is the

1971
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,600
disease model

1972
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,340
um and the idea here is that addiction

1973
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,800
is a disease and that disease is

1974
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,780
characterized by

1975
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,600
changes in the brain

1976
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,880
which changes to brain structures which

1977
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,800
mean the addict

1978
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,320
um can't help but act in a certain way

1979
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,480
when confronted with a certain stimulus

1980
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,960
so it's this loss of control that's

1981
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,400
engendered through these brain

1982
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,340
structures and this is this is the idea

1983
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,980
of it being a disease

1984
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:02,659
um

1985
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:05,640
the work that I'm going to describe now

1986
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,260
um I won't go into too much detail here

1987
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,659
but it's it's it's kind of founded on

1988
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:11,400
this thought that this disease model

1989
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,500
can't quite it can't

1990
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,900
be quite right because

1991
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,640
these changes in brain structure

1992
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,440
essentially they like that's what the

1993
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,780
brain does like we it's just learning

1994
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,520
like this is what we do all the time

1995
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,880
like essentially me completing my PhD is

1996
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,219
a process of me undergoing changes to my

1997
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:30,659
brain

1998
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:34,980
um such that I'm kind of uh disposed to

1999
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,080
act in certain ways

2000
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,480
um so there's no so Mark Lewis I think

2001
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,000
it's Mark Lewis in his book 2018 the

2002
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,100
biology of Desire

2003
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,920
um argues look addiction is more of just

2004
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,960
a dysfunction in learning it's not

2005
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,480
really a disease so we need to think

2006
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,620
about it

2007
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:55,560
um a little bit differently and this

2008
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,739
work by Miller and colleagues 2020

2009
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:02,219
um that's where it picks up okay so the

2010
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:05,060
idea is that those brain changes

2011
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,140
engendered through exposure to a

2012
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,520
stimulus in this case we're going to

2013
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,500
talk about a drug okay we're going to

2014
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,000
leave behavioral addiction aside for a

2015
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,080
second

2016
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,880
um that clearly plays a critical role

2017
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,820
okay so nobody is going to deny

2018
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,420
um

2019
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,659
the kind of chemical like the role the

2020
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:23,640
importance of the biology here um that's

2021
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,020
that's going on in the brain and of

2022
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,580
course different drugs have different

2023
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,800
chemical profiles in that regard

2024
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,719
um but on this view we're going to kind

2025
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,120
of shift Focus from that slightly

2026
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,980
and we're going to have a much more

2027
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,440
active picture where we view addiction

2028
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,600
as a self-organizing process of whole

2029
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,140
agent environment systems Okay so

2030
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,360
um I have this extract here it is in the

2031
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,820
dynamic interaction between the agent

2032
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,800
and its environment that addiction is

2033
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,560
born and endures okay so the harm of

2034
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,719
addiction emerges from a breakdown in

2035
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,760
the broader stable dynamics that

2036
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,460
typically underpin a flourishing life

2037
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,820
work family friends health and so on so

2038
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,100
these you know typically flourishing

2039
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,920
life has a broad kind of bush of

2040
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,080
concerns over different time scales in

2041
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,659
different areas and what we're going to

2042
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:14,520
see is that the harm of addiction is in

2043
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,320
a narrowing of those concerns

2044
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,500
so what happens is when somebody

2045
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,239
takes a drug

2046
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,219
um to some people who are exposed to

2047
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:29,580
drugs that drug is going to through

2048
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,940
direct action on some neural mechanisms

2049
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,800
is going to signal to the agent that

2050
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,840
they've done better than expected at

2051
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,460
reducing prediction error of course this

2052
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,739
is illusory they haven't really done

2053
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:42,420
better than expected in anything that

2054
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,179
matters that the signal they get is wow

2055
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:46,800
like we have just reduced prediction

2056
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,320
error at this insane rate

2057
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,560
um and repeated use through this

2058
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,560
aerodynamics mechanism repeated use is

2059
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,840
going to tune our expectations about the

2060
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,239
kinds of prediction errors slopes the

2061
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,460
kind of slopes of prediction error that

2062
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,140
are available to us in the environment

2063
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,360
and we're going to start to expect those

2064
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,580
vertiginous slopes of error reduction if

2065
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,940
we continue to engage with the drug

2066
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,280
and once those expectations become

2067
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,320
deeply ingrained

2068
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,780
um anything else we do is going to start

2069
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:22,560
to feel like failure okay so if I get

2070
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,780
used to taking cocaine all the time and

2071
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,179
then I have to sit through a family meal

2072
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:29,040
where I don't have any drugs and I have

2073
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,460
to kind of sit still and there's no

2074
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,580
dopamine available I don't have my phone

2075
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,080
that's I'm going to experience that as

2076
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,440
feelings of frustration and as if I'm

2077
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,060
being prevented from doing something I

2078
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,580
want to do and I'm going to experience

2079
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,920
that as doing worse than expected okay

2080
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,620
so I've learned these expectations for

2081
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,840
prediction err minimization and I'm not

2082
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,760
getting them unless I engage with the

2083
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,560
drug and of course it's worth noting

2084
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,300
that in many cases these drugs are going

2085
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,699
to have a chemical withdrawal effects

2086
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,560
that compound that as well especially

2087
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,780
things like nicotine and alcohol in

2088
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,820
particular is very nasty so alcohol can

2089
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,920
kill you if you uh if you try and

2090
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,540
withdraw from it too quickly so they

2091
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,199
really do pull the agent into grip

2092
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,000
so what happens here is the agent

2093
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,060
develops a kind of sub-optimal grip so

2094
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,900
you start to enact a new world a new

2095
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,820
identity so instead of doing all the

2096
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,260
things you once cared about like

2097
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,420
different Hobbies you start to hang out

2098
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,040
with different people you start to

2099
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,260
frequent different places like a

2100
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,900
dealer's House or wherever and very

2101
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,659
slowly you start to carve out

2102
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:39,960
essentially a niche the addict enacts a

2103
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,580
particular Niche through their actions

2104
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:45,179
and they have quite a good grip on that

2105
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:48,060
Niche it's just that it doesn't speak to

2106
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,760
a broader array of concerns

2107
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,340
so

2108
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,380
what's really important is that this is

2109
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,380
not this pushes back against a disease

2110
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,600
model because on this view the active

2111
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,360
inference agent the well the system is

2112
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,000
doing essentially what it was evolved to

2113
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,040
do so

2114
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,239
um there's another quote from the paper

2115
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:12,000
here that I like that says their habits

2116
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,460
allow them to remain well attuned

2117
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,380
and keep prediction errors under tight

2118
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,140
control so long as they remain within

2119
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,080
the narrow confines of such a niche so

2120
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,060
it's not the and this is important

2121
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,699
because it shows that allostatic control

2122
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:29,520
and prediction error minimization are

2123
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,500
not the same thing they come apart and

2124
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,239
this really it speaks to a question that

2125
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:36,420
was asked after Abel's session recently

2126
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,080
um

2127
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,820
about what this prediction error

2128
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:42,120
actually look like well in this case you

2129
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,640
you have a system that has learned the

2130
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,699
engagement with certain affordances

2131
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:50,580
gives it it's an illusion but it has

2132
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:53,159
this feedback that says this is you know

2133
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:55,199
this is the state you expect to occupy

2134
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,719
oh this is a state that has the agent

2135
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:00,600
has learned to expect to occupy and it's

2136
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,900
carved out a niche of affordances that

2137
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,060
means it's very likely to occupy that

2138
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,800
state so it actually has a really good

2139
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,340
grip on the situation it's just that

2140
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:14,159
um that Niche is very narrow and it's

2141
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,560
constricted meaning

2142
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,440
um it's simply

2143
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,820
that kind of uh

2144
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,520
those habits and that web of Habitual

2145
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,060
action policies are just not well suited

2146
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:31,520
um to maintained good allostatic control

2147
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,520
so everything else in the Alex Life

2148
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,679
Starts to suffer

2149
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,320
so we can kind of think of this as a

2150
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,000
form of Niche construction gone wrong

2151
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,100
and I think we're going to look at Niche

2152
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,659
Construction in the in the coming weeks

2153
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,040
as well

2154
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:47,640
um

2155
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,400
so why is this whole agent well so I

2156
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,840
should say just to back up a second so

2157
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,800
this is

2158
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,239
what I like about this account of

2159
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,920
addiction is that it's a thoroughly an

2160
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,840
active account of addiction it really

2161
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,960
brings out the kind of inactive core of

2162
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,840
active inference so the addict is

2163
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,020
addiction becomes an identity it becomes

2164
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,179
a world that the person actually

2165
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:11,880
produces through their actions so rather

2166
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,520
than the disease model where you have a

2167
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,460
person and a stimulus and exposure you

2168
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,020
know whenever they're exposed to that

2169
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,520
stimulus they're going to have problems

2170
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,040
because of these brain changes what this

2171
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,260
does Justice do is actually the activity

2172
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,719
of the agent so they're not accidentally

2173
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,520
bumping into this stimulus and the

2174
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,440
environment they're Del and they're not

2175
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,420
just seeking it out but they're

2176
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,100
deliberately restructuring their

2177
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,860
environment to make this state more and

2178
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,840
more likely over time

2179
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,840
so it really does does Justice to the

2180
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,659
efficacy and the agency of the agent

2181
01:25:45,659 --> 01:25:47,640
rather than

2182
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,179
giving that agency a more backseat role

2183
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:52,980
that it takes in the disease model

2184
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,199
but the other thing that it does because

2185
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:58,560
it's this inactive uh picture is that it

2186
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,480
also does Justice to the environmental

2187
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,060
features so it also

2188
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,699
um it kind of speaks to the fact that

2189
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,980
addiction is not just all in the head

2190
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,620
actually the real

2191
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,840
um some of the problems of Addiction

2192
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,840
come with the fact that it is this

2193
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,020
um procedural constructive process and

2194
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,179
one of my favorite experiments of all

2195
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,219
time is um I don't know if people are

2196
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,320
familiar with the Rat City experiments

2197
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,780
this is why I've got the image up here

2198
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:30,320
and this is a very cool experiment where

2199
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,460
originally it was found that if you

2200
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:36,239
exposed rats to a drug-laced stimulus

2201
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,420
and environment I think it was um

2202
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,880
I think it was heroin laced water or it

2203
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,620
might have been cocaine um but the

2204
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,360
original experiments found that like

2205
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,800
nearly all the rats would kill

2206
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,360
themselves with the drug so they would

2207
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,260
just keep keep keep at the drug until

2208
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,420
um until they died and it was a very

2209
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,179
very very high percentage of the rats

2210
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:58,500
would engage in that destructive

2211
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,260
behavior until the experiments were

2212
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,940
re-run

2213
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,159
um sometime later and instead of having

2214
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:07,440
the wrap just in a boring cage on its

2215
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,320
own it had the rats in Rat Park which

2216
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,560
was a very social exciting brightly

2217
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,300
colored environment with lots of

2218
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,400
different affordances and what they

2219
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,219
found was that given the same Choice A

2220
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:22,260
vastly reduced proportion of the rats

2221
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,880
would choose to engage with the drug

2222
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,260
okay so it's capturing the importance of

2223
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:30,659
Niche construction that I think is

2224
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:33,360
really nice here and it also speaks to

2225
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,659
the role played by embodied affect in

2226
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:39,000
phenomenology there's something that

2227
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,760
it's like to be an addict and that

2228
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,920
really matters okay it really matters

2229
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,760
that the addict has these embodied

2230
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,440
experiences when they're engaging with

2231
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,879
particular sets of affordances

2232
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,139
so that's really summed up in the

2233
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:57,060
overview that I've put here so these

2234
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,260
were the things that I wanted to

2235
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,580
emphasize

2236
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,699
um active inference agents are embodied

2237
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:05,820
they're embedded in a landscape that

2238
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,920
landscape is constituted by particular

2239
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,080
affordances and we can distinguish

2240
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,139
between a landscape of affordances and a

2241
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:14,820
field of affordances and that

2242
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,820
distinction really speaks to the

2243
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,860
inherent affectivity and normativity of

2244
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:22,440
affordances okay this which affordances

2245
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,179
stand out to a certain particular time

2246
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:27,360
which exit a pull over us

2247
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,460
um an active inference agents enact

2248
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,800
their worlds through action and this is

2249
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,420
nowhere stalker than in the case of

2250
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,040
addiction

2251
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:35,820
um

2252
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,940
active inference agents are effective so

2253
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,100
emotion plays this super crucial role

2254
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,159
keeping is keeping us tuned keeping us

2255
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:47,580
in that uh grip with our affordances and

2256
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,440
helping us contextualize those important

2257
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,840
physiological changes

2258
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,780
um active inference agents are agents

2259
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:57,540
okay so we do have a way to describe

2260
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,620
Behavior as agential and motivated and

2261
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,719
we do have these cognitive architectures

2262
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:06,659
that can make sense of agential action

2263
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:09,659
and active inference agents have this

2264
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:11,880
inbuilt sense of self that comes with

2265
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,760
agency as well

2266
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,639
so that's pretty much it this final

2267
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:19,679
slide just goes over some of the things

2268
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,139
that we can expect so this what I've

2269
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:24,659
done today I hope has laid a good

2270
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,880
groundwork and has installed some higher

2271
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,100
level expectations to learn more about

2272
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,800
active inference and what we're going to

2273
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,960
do in the subsequent weeks is now scale

2274
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,719
this up to see how when you have more

2275
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,340
than one active inference agent together

2276
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,639
how the expectations of some can impact

2277
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:43,320
the expectations of others and

2278
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,920
individuals and I look forward to

2279
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,580
to learn more about that but as for me

2280
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:53,239
uh that's it

2281
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,960
Amazing Ben awesome work

2282
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,780
what can people look forward to next

2283
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,600
week or in two weeks if they join the

2284
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,159
discussions section like what's it going

2285
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:06,840
to be like or who would you encourage to

2286
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,400
join

2287
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,139
um I would definitely I mean the more

2288
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:11,340
people that come along I think the

2289
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,719
better it's going to be I'm really

2290
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,780
looking forward to it I'm I'm kind of

2291
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,520
just in the first place Intrigue to see

2292
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,560
that we we covered so much ground I'm

2293
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,239
just interested to see where people want

2294
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:23,639
to go with this and see where people's

2295
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:25,320
interests lie

2296
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,360
um I assume that the people are going to

2297
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,780
have questions and I think maybe the

2298
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,300
best way to do it would be to explore

2299
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,520
some of people's questions during the

2300
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,320
discussion we can use them to kick

2301
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,840
things off and keep things going and but

2302
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,719
I think it's likely that that disco we

2303
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,060
we have a whole hour so we've certainly

2304
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,920
got time to really dig into things in

2305
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,920
some detail and like I said before we're

2306
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,860
going to have Mark Miller with us and

2307
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:56,520
Mark is just awesome in discussion it's

2308
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,679
very very passionate and enthusiastic

2309
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:01,860
about his work and he can do a much

2310
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,900
better job than I can in explaining it

2311
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,239
so I just um just to have the

2312
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,679
opportunity to speak with Mark about his

2313
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,540
work I would I would say definitely come

2314
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,659
along

2315
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,800
all right anything else otherwise again

2316
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,420
awesome job

2317
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,179
uh no I think that's it cool thanks for

2318
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:20,340
listening I guess well thanks it was a

2319
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,940
pleasure it was ambitious to to what you

2320
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:27,900
did elegantly with no equations

2321
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:31,860
or getting snagged on any of the

2322
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:35,340
potentially infinite philosophical and

2323
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:38,219
uh tactical and normative and all these

2324
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:40,139
different layers of Challenge and

2325
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:43,139
diversions so to really

2326
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:45,659
um to really cut a path there is great

2327
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,639
yeah I think it just speaks to there's

2328
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:49,920
there's so much good philosophical work

2329
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,080
in these areas in active influence and

2330
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,639
predictive processing and I should say

2331
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:57,300
again I mean I I we didn't really do

2332
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,920
justice to any of the work I talked

2333
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,900
about so that's the final thing I would

2334
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,820
say is definitely you know the the

2335
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:05,760
document is there with the reading and

2336
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,980
please go and um actually look at the

2337
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,480
work of these people because it's it's

2338
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,000
something that's really really good

2339
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,199
all right

2340
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:17,599
till next time cool thank you very much
