650	25960	00:00	Lecture by Ben White on basics of active inference, the active inference agent. Off to you and we're looking forward to it.	Ben White will lecture on basics of active inference for the social sciences	Inactive Inference
26330	162880	00:26	The first module on the course is about the active inference agent. The aims for today are to provide a wide ranging overview of how active inference has connected with areas of philosophical interest. This is all going to be fairly abstract in terms of how everything fits together.	This module looks at how active inference has connected with philosophical interests	The Active Inference Agent
163490	260960	02:43	Active inference is based on Carl Fristen's free energy principle. All adaptive behavior is explained by agents garnering evidence to confirm their own expectations. For the purposes of the lecture today, I'm going to treat these as synonymous with predictive processing.	Active inference is based on Carl Fristen's free energy principle	Inactive Inference and Predictive Processing
262630	645450	04:22	The key concepts of active inference, predictive processing then. Where there's a discrepancy between the actual incoming sense data and the prediction, prediction errors are generated. Predictive errors can be minimized using one of two strategies.	Key concepts of active inference, predictive processing involved in visual perception	Inferring and Predictive Processing
646510	681106	10:46	How does active inference characterize cognition? How is cognition related to the material environment? And we're going to ask quite briefly what kinds of vehicles might realize cognitive processing.	How does active inference characterize cognition? How is cognition related to the material environment	Six guiding questions for cognition
681298	875184	11:21	The idea of affordances first emerges in the work of James Gibson. They are things in the environment that the agent can act upon. Different surfaces and features of the environment will afford different things depending on your particular skill set. Agents are going to go about minimizing uncertainty, staying attuned to their environment through an engagement with affordances.	Attunement is one of those concepts that gets thrown around a lot	Attunement and the science of inference
875232	1349070	14:35	Andy Clark: Inactivism comes in various strands. There's autopoietic inactivism, where the structures that give a ground to life are the same structures that instantiate cognitive processes. And then there's radical inactivist, where cognition is purely grounded in agent environment dynamics. What are we committing ourselves to with active inference?	Inactivism comes in various strands, very quickly and roughly	What are we Committing To With Active Inference?
1350640	1584354	22:30	The extended mind is the claim that under some conditions the system that's realizing cognitive processing can literally extend outwards from the mind. Andy Clark thinks that active inference accommodates the extended mind theory. He says it solves old problems in philosophy of mind theoretical cognitive science.	Andy Clark says active inference accommodates extended mind theory	Extended Active Inference and Cognitivism
1584482	1702060	26:24	There's a challenge here about how active inference can account for what appear to be motivated agential actions. And I'm going to set active inference up in a kind of dialectic with folk psychology here, because folk psychology faces no such concerns.	There's a challenge here about how active inference can account for motivated actions	Inactive Inference and Agency in Science
1704030	2497478	28:24	The dark room problem invites more than one answer. Colin Klein argues that predictions alone can't account for the motivational character of these needs. How does active inference actually account for agential behavior?	The dark room problem invites more than one answer. One response is to talk about what drives curiosity and play	Dark Room Problem and Intelligence
2497574	2655580	41:37	In this section I'm going to introduce quite a lot of stuff, but it's going to be all tied together hopefully rather neatly in the case study. At the end, I'll talk about alistasis and emotion and a little bit about the self as well.	We worry about the relationship between active inference and folk psychology	Folk Psychology and Alistasis
2657150	2908480	44:17	The notion of alistasis plays a major role in a lot of work on emotion and the self in active inference. Our highest expectation is to have good allostatic control. Not having good control has been linked with reduced cardiac health and sleep problems.	Brain evolved to minimize prediction error to manage body's metabolic budget	Priority 6, Alistasis
2911170	3252620	48:31	Allostatic control means inferring the causes of changes to the body's internal state. The brain is making predictions about its own internal states and then it's going to engage in some kind of action to minimize any prediction errors. Theory of Constructed Emotion says emotions are constructions, just like percepts are.	Lisa Feldman Barrett's Theory of Constructed Emotion is incredibly important	The Theory of Constructed Emotion
3255890	3717850	54:15	Allostatic control for humans can involve very, very temporarily extended timescales. To do this, the system must engage in interceptive prediction over its own internal states. This has formed the basis for a lot of interesting work on phenomena like depersonalization.	George Dean and colleagues propose a model of the self under active inference	A sense of self under active inference
3719600	3842130	1:01:59	This is the final section. I want to try and pull together some of the things I've been talking about. The case study I'm going to use is addiction. In the discussion section on the 25th we're actually going to be joined by Mark Miller. If anybody has any specific questions, he'll be the man to answer them.	This is the final section of our phenomenology talk	Phenology 4, The predictive process in literature
3843380	3910280	1:04:03	When we're going about whatever business we have in the world, we always feel like something. So I want to draw on some work in phenomenology that some active inference theorists have also drawn on and made use of. This is a really good grounding for some of the things I'm going to go on to say.	I want to keep the focus on feelings, although what I'm talking about here are	Phenality and Active Inference
3910620	4568110	1:05:10	Matthew Ratcliffe argues that he's identified this space of feelings that have been largely neglected in the wider literature. He describes these as existential feelings. These feelings are really about how we are orientated in regards to the world. The work builds a bridge between computational models and neurobiology and phenomenological experience.	Matthew Ratcliffe describes existential feelings as feeling at one with the world	Introspection and the Law of Systems
4569680	4986590	1:16:09	The idea here is that addiction is a disease characterized by changes in the brain. Mark Lewis argues addiction is more of just a dysfunction in learning. We're going to have a much more active picture where we view addiction as a self organizing process of whole agent environment systems.	Mark Lewis says addiction is more of a dysfunction in learning than a disease	Addiction and the brain
4986740	5470060	1:23:06	Active inference agents are embodied. They're embedded in a landscape. That landscape is constituted by particular affordances. And active inference agents enact their worlds through action. So we have cognitive architectures that can make sense of agential action.	This is a thoroughly inactive account of addiction. It really brings out the inactive core of active inference	Inference and the Problem of Addiction
5471870	5531260	1:31:11	The document is there with the reading, and please go and actually look at the work of these people, because some of it's really good. There's so much good philosophical work in these areas in active inference and predictive processing.	It was ambitious to do what you did elegantly with no equations	Awesome job on Active Inference and Predictive Processing!
5531950	5536480	1:32:11	All right. Thank you very much. See you. Till next time.	All right. Cool. Thank you very much. Till next time	TALKING TO
